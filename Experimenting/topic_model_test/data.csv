"Hmmm... It's been exactly a month since i was scammed. I still remember exactly that it was 3pm on Friday, i was walking around in a shopping mall and 'a girl' sent me a messages on FB that she wanted to chat with me.... I met that girl on a dating site, dateinasia to be more specific, i found her actually. She had facebook account on the site, so i added. She was surprised why i knew her FB, and then kept asking about my personal things like what i do, what my parents do, she tried to find out about my financial support right at the first time we chat(i should have known).That was few weeks before the scam...I went back from the shopping mall and started chatting with 'her'. After a while, we changed to skype chat.she asked me if i was alone, she felt bored..and asked for a video chat. She said she would take off her clothes if i do the same. I couldn't think much, that was a very attractive girl on the cam. Then i got myself exposed..She recorded and then sent me the youtube link to the video, the links to my friends' facebook and told me if i don't want my friends to see this video, i have to send her money, otherwise she will send it to my friends on facebook. I was scared, panic and completely in her control...that was a pathetic moment, i felt so stupid..i did a lot of begging..she said just send her the money and she won't do it, she said she always keeps her word. I had no choice but to believe that.And she needed immediately. I ran to the Western Union, that was 5.35pm, to send the money, but the staff told me the system closes at 5.30pm so i was 5 minutes late. I tried another money shop, it was the same. So i couldn't send it immediately, i told her the reason, and she gave me another chance to send the money before 9AM the next day (Saturday). I begged again and again, even thought of suicide. She just tried to calm me down by kept saying she always keeps her words. I completely lost. I started to think "what should i do" "what should i do" and then decided to tell the police. They couldn't help, because the scammer in Philippines. The policeman gave me his advice: Don't send her money, if i send her money she will ask for more. Be prepared for the video and then i need to move on...I went back, started to search "extortion" because i had no idea what scammer was. I found similar case, or i can just say some were exactly the same: "a girl from phil got a video, asks for money'...Then i found scamsurvivor, i looked almost immediately for online help. I met firefly, SlappHappy and Wayne, they helped me to understand what the scammers do and were very patient to answer all of the 'what if' and 'but questions i asked. They told me what to do, they have a strategy to deal with scammers, they told me everything i needed to do..what the police couldn't tell. I had a really hard time in the first few days, i stayed online on scamsurvivors just to seek for helps if anything happens. Nothing happened but all the question i had. They helped me get through the hard time. Thank you again firefly, SlapHappy and Wayne who were there to tell me what to do and explained everything to me. RF came later and helped me with recovering, thank you also. It's been a month now and I survive. Thanks to the moderators and admin Wayne for all the help.I was lucky...just 5 minutes late and the Western Union system closed. That 5 minutes saved my money, and gave me the time to seek for police advice, and find scamsurvivors.I was blackmail scammed. I survive. that 5 minutes were just like a miracle. If you are a victim and you are reading this, you are still lucky that you find scamsurviors.That is my story..I got scammed and i survived. (i am now too sleepy so other details will be added later when i remember)"
"My story is similar to Wayne's. I just stumbled on it while clicking funnylinks. I had never heard of scambaiting before, and was amazed at the crazythings that ordinary people could get scammers to do for a promise of cash.It appealed to my sense of creativity and drama, like writing a screenplay withthe scammers as the main characters, only they do not know they are acting init.We both started on the same baiter website, but I was never that interested inthe "yucky factor" of baiting love scammers. I used to drop into the LoveForum there, and see and read of the latest "Wayne and Pinky baits" once inawhile just for a chuckle. I liked safari baiting the best and mentoringothers who were interested. About 4 years ago I started doing lots of audiocalls to scammers as part of baits and internet radio shows that we had toeducate people about scammers. It was about this time that I got to know Wayneand Pinky better. After about 5 years of baiting scammers, I was ready for achange. Wayne asked me to join him on another website, and so I left to helpthe other side of the scam, dealing with the victims. I've learned many newthings and have enjoyed helping them recover. I still do some baiting,mentoring, and audio calls playing "fake victims" in other baits. I stillenjoy the drama of baits, developing new characters, playing audio improv incold calls to scammers to find good candidates for business disruptions. It'smy comic relief.For other hobbies, I enjoy fishing, canoing, and other outdoor activities.I have the World's Most Stubborn Cat now, so if anyone wants her, I'd be gladto donate her to you. You must not like your new walls, furniture, doors, orany other cat-scratchable surfaces. She loves to modify them to look likerough-barked trees. She is absolutely immune to the word, "NO!" screamed atincredible volumes, water sprays, staying outside all night as punishments.She needs 24-hour/day constant attention and supervision, unlike all newbornbabies. Even Premies need less watching than her. She likes to sleep all dayand keep you awake all night. I have a feeling that she may not really be acat at all, but a Tasmanian Devil."
"So guys I am reciting my story because I believe that what happened to me shouldn't happen to anyone in the entire world. I am hoping that it can help others to avoid such scams... Basically my story is similar to most of the stories you are reading in this page, I registered to dating site "muslims.com" which is being quite popular now days in the place which I currently live in. And I do get some emails from very nice girls with pictures all the time and a personal email address, and those I usually ignore because one time I contacted one girl on her personal email and she kept sending very nice emails with photos of a very hot lady and her son. Yet I was suspicious because a woman like that can get anyone she wants from the middle of her town, so why using a website to make friends with people around the globe, so back again what I did is that I uploaded the photo to google and it turned out that it was a photo of a famous romanian model!!! I emailed saying that I know who is in the photo so please stop writing me and she or he did stop... Yet, again another women came on the same website and started chatting normally, showing very nice photos and she said that she lives in Qatar but she is from morocco, and then asked me to skype and chat, so we started to chat on skype asking a lot of personal stuff and then told me do you have facebook and I told her yes and stupidly added her... So on facebook she asked if I was alone? I replied yeah, then she said do you like sex? I said who doesn't!! Then she said lets go to skype and have some video fun,, so no thinking just making a video call and there you go a sexy women taking it off and telling me to do the same and thus I did, stupidly I can say... After a few moments the link was lost and the girl was saying just give me a sec cause my sister is leaving the house and I have to shut the door, after that in like 5 minutes I am getting a call showing a recording of me... So, here I am completely shocked thinking of how and how did I do such a thing cause the girl was showing me names of my family from facebook and threatening to share the video with them unless I pay... I am still under shock and without any thinking went to WU and wired the money and kept calling the number asking if she received it, cause she promised to delete it if I do wire now "which I didn't believe for a sec" but I am shocked and being threaten by a scammer!!! Anyways, a guy replied on the phone and he said please open skype and hang up, few minutes later I got an IM on skype from her saying that she got the money but you know how life is expensive and I need more and swearing to delete it if I do, I told her but you promised, she said yes but I really need more. So I told her "realizing that he is a guy" sorry but I can't right now because I simply don't have, she said come on just wire, I said sorry but I don't have. By the way this was happening between 7 to 8 PM, so later that night she came back telling me that I am a guy and I just played a video of women taking her clothing and if you want to believe me open skype now and I will show you myself, I told him look I know you are a guy since you played back the video so no need, then he said please wire money and again I told him that I don't have, then he said ok take a week and try to arrange some. I told him no promises he said no a week... The next day I was in a very bad shape, I went to work with a very long face and I have one person whom I can trust and tell the story, so I called him telling man if anything happens to me it's all because of this and that, and he tried to calm me down and he did for a bit... Then during the day I was googling the term blackmail and skype and find this wonderful website. But I couldn't enter live help until I went back home, and so I did, I found firefly and wayne in the chat room and they really did a great job which I don't know if I can ever repay them the same help and support... So action was done, which is to disappear from the world wide web, I kept googling my full name and keep finding websites that i've registered to previously in my life, so kept disabling and deactivating until I reached a clean search, yet the clock is ticking and days are passing and the scammer called me after five days but I NEVER picked up, as a matter of fact I knew the timings which he come and start calling so I managed to keep my phone switched off during those times... All of this happened since 10 days now, I didn't receive a call for the past three days and hoping that I wont. I kept thinking a lot about it and talking a lot about it with the guys in the live help which they kept advising me on what to do and how to react. But eventually I reached an understanding which I believe it's part of the message those wonderful people on this site are trying to pass to us which is, if the scammer can't get hold on to you then how can he blackmail you?? so ask yourself that question because I do everyday,,, how can he blackmail you unless you communicate back? I guess the answer is obvious which is "he can't" and what options does he have? Sending the video to your friends on Facebook? He will lose an opportunity if he does... No use for him... Now, if I get a call anytime soon I will react the same by not answering and switching my phone off and I will wont let the guy to destroy my life and keep blackmailing me forever, so just lose him and I think you will be safer... One small advise, our personal info. are very much exposed now days because of the new era of social networks, so please everyone always check your privacy settings and talk to people whom you know only through the web... I think this is it. Finally, again and again, I really thank firefly and wayne and all other admins and users whom supported me and helped me to come out of it... Thanks,"
"Well where do I begin?  I have always considered myself to be an intelligent and cautious person that is until the last few months. Although on reflection and after researching and reading so many stories I have now come to realise that I am still intelligent but perhaps not as cautious as I should have been!  You see I wasn't really looking for love, certainly not on the Internet. It just came to me one fateful day when I received a friend request on Facebook in July 2011 from a handsome man living in New York. It came at a time when I was very lonely but getting on ok with life but also when a close relative, and some one by dear to me was terminally ill with an aggresive brain tumor. Having some one pay you so much attention and tell you the things you have been wanting to hear and haven't heard for a long time was flattering.  It took a while to get to the point when I allowed myself to fall for him. I kept telling him we are just friends but then I let my guard down. The expressions of love and gratitude for me being in his life came pouring in. In mid August he won a contract in Malaysia ..... That is when it all fell apart.... After a few days he ran out of money telling me that items were more expensive than in the states. I told him I had no money but after some pestering I sent a small amount. He said friends were helping him too.  Next step ..... His 'birthday' was on <cough> 16 September and my present to him was showing too much of myself on a webcam .... He pressured me into this despite me telling him how uncomfortable I was about it.  This is when it turned nasty and the next day when I woke up I recieved an email with three videos and one line saying 'how do you like these honey' I was mortified and to say that that weekend was the worst weekend in my life is an understatement.  I then recieved a text message saying that as long as I deliver his demand, the videos were safe with him. The demand was $5,000 USD. I did not have this money certainly not in the time frame he demanded. I sent him the money about two weeks later.  The story is a long one and continues until now .....  I emailed a friend of his who said he was a good man who was frustrated and not normally like that. He was not a criminal were his words.  He even got bowel cancer and I had a doctor from Malaysia call me in the middle of the night telling me I had to send $30',000 Malaysian dollars .... I didn't have this.  He threatened me with the videos four times .... I stopped all contact when I found him on romancescam .... But the damage has been done .... I had sent a considerable sum of money .... Much more that the $5,000  Last week I recieved texts from him saying he knew I had reported and posted his pictures on a scam site. Funny thing is I didn't post any pictures just a copy of his cancelled Facebook page.  Well that is some of my story .... There is much more but I guess you get the message ....  It has been hell and I just hope it stops soon.  Thank you for allowing me to be apart of this forum and particular thanks to AB and RF who sent me in this direction. I hope I can make a difference"
"I go by almost_bit because I am one of the fortunate few who ended up feeling like I outwitted my scammer.  I was not brand new to dating sites. In fact, I’ve met several great guys on them and I still believe they’re a good way to meet people if you’re cautious.  I met ‘Alfred’ on match.com. He claimed to be an architect/construction guy who built commercial buildings in Europe. Though he said he lived locally, he was in Turkey building a resort complex. Within a few weeks, he declared his love for me. I remember telling him that he couldn’t say such things until he got back home and met me in person.  I was always somewhat suspicious. I googled everything he told me, and I could never find anything to verify the things he told me. The name of his deceased wife – no obituary online. The unusual name of his sister in Ohio. His company website that he said was down. But I’ll also admit that I got caught up in it.  After a few week courtship, he said that his ipad and iphone got fried because one of his employees plugged it into the wrong outlet. He was unable to replace it in Turkey, and he needed me to buy and ship one to him. His story seemed plausible, and he even knew the correct number of Apple stores in Turkey (I did my own research), so I agreed to do this. I sent it via USPS, using global express mail.  He asked me to send him money, and I was really reluctant to do so. He tried to use me as a mule. He told me that because I wouldn’t loan him money, he couldn’t pay his employees. So his engineer’s wife was sending money to the engineer. She would send me a moneygram for $500. I was to pick it up and send him the money via western union. Since I was on my way to a meeting after work, he looked up the nearest moneygram location and gave it to me. I stopped at the CVS pharmacy, picked up the red phone, and asked moneygram if there was money there for me, gave them the tracking number and the sender’s name. They confirmed that there was. I asked how scams work with moneygram, and I told them that I was refusing the money. Then I texted my scammer and told him that the moneygram phone was out of order and I’d try when I got home after my meeting. When I got home, I looked up the location of the woman trying to send me money and saw that there were 10 WUs within 10 miles of her city. (My scammer had told me there weren’t any and that was why she needed to relay through me.) I called moneygram to ask more questions. I learned that the money was no longer available to me. (It had been redirected.)  My scammer continued to pressure me to send money. He asked me to send $4000 via WU, and I might have done so. But I googled the name of the financial agent that he wanted me to send money to, and the site that came up was RS. It was the first time I'd found anything online about him, and it was all the proof I needed that he was a scammer. I told my scammer that I tried to go to WU, but that this was too much to ask and that I’d gotten sick in the parking lot trying to do it.  I called USPS to tell them that the ipad and iphone I’d sent were to a scammer and gave them the tracking number. I wanted to get them back. They told me that once they’d left the country, there was nothing they could do.  The ipad and iphone reached Turkey, where they got stuck in customs. The customs fees were about $500, and my scammer called to ask if I would pay it. He said I’d need to set up a Fedex account and pay through that. He gave me the tracking numbers and the detailed costs. This was the first I knew that USPS sent global packages via Fedex. At this point, my scammer had the option to pay the fees himself and get the package. I called Fedex, set up the account, and told them that I wanted the package returned to me. And I told my scammer that I had set up the Fedex account and that I was working with them. I did not want him to know what I had done until the package left Turkey and I was certain that he couldn’t divert it.  Between the time that I confirmed him as a scammer via RS and when I got the package back, about 2 or 3 weeks went by. I continued to interact with my scammer, and I have since learned that what I was doing was a form of baiting. I’d chat with him and try to guess how old he really was by his answers to questions like how old he was when he first got a cell phone. I’d catch him in lies and call him on them. He’d give some excuse, call me silly, and I’d go along with him. This went on until my scammer found out that I had posted him on RS, and he called to confront me. He threatened me, gave me a 24 hour ultimatum. Once that 24 hours passed, he dropped me. I have not heard from him since.  The day that I got that package back was such a feeling of victory! I spent money on shipping, customs fees, and phone calls, but nothing that I spent went to the scammer.  But my sense of ‘outwitting’ him didn’t end there.  He had started saying things like ‘I love you more than you will ever know’. I only ever said that to him once. It was the day that I posted him on RS. That night, we talked about unconditional love, and I told him there were things that I could do that would make him not love me. He disagreed, of course, but he didn’t yet know that I had just posted all of the details he’d given me on RS. At the end of that session, I told him that I loved him more than he would ever know. To me, I was really saying goodbye to a fantasy. He didn’t recognize it, but for me, I was ending things on my terms. He just didn’t need to know that….because the ipad was still in transit….and I spent the next 2 weeks pretending to still be hooked.  After this, there were 3 more victories for me over my scammer. I was the first to post this scammer on RS. Three other victims found my post. And our stories enmeshed. I am using the names as they posted them in my thread.  - AlmostBit2 – She had not yet sent any money, but my posting exposed the scammer and protected her. She confronted him. Because of this, he knew that I had posted him on RS. He called me and confronted me. Threatened me.  - ALOT – She is the one who tried to send me $500 to relay, the moneygram that I refused. She was also a victim of this scammer. She did lose that $500 to him – he gave her a different name to send it to. But because she found my post, my scammer was exposed again.  - Caringsister – This one is harder. The brother of a woman who was also being scammed found my post. It was enough to convince him that she was being scammed. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough for his sister. Last I knew, she had sent an ipad and refused to believe he was a scammer. The situation was tearing their family apart. Pinky did contact the person whose photos were used in our scam. He is yet another victim. He added a disclaimer on his facebook page: “Just learned a criminal going by Alfred is using my images to scam women out of money because he is financially trapped in Africa or Malaysia! Don't give this bastard a dime!”  My story is long because it was complicated. There were at least 4 concurrent victims of this scammer, my posting alerted the other 3, and our scams impacted each other. But in the end, I feel like I won. I got my ipad back. I exposed my scammer to three other victims. I got to say goodbye on my own terms (scammer didn’t know I was doing so, but it was for my benefit, not his.) I got my first taste of baiting.  Since then, I’ve gone on to do other baits, with mentoring from Slappy and Frumpy. The most fun so far has been Harry and Lola, where my cobaiter duckhunter introduced me to some great baiting toys.  I went on a radio program with Pinky to talk about romance scams. I expect to return to that show in the fall with Slappy and Bluefox to talk about this site.  And I’ve made some great friends in this anti-scam community."
"I met Stanislav Lukashov-Станислав Лукашов from St. Petersburg, Russia at a webcam site where he was a model. When he found out I was a doctor, he befriended me. He made me feel special and gave me his personal information and photos. He quit the job and covinced me to pay his salery. He got me to buy him a car after promising to come to the US and spend his life with me. Of course he never came. He deceived me and manipulated my emotions for twenty months. He got me to send him money every month. I sent $1000-$3000 per month. He quit his job and convinced me to pay his salery. He always told me how wonderful I was and how much he loved me.  He was always full of kind words and promises, except when I failed to give him everything he wanted or when I questioned his sincerity. The delivery of money always made things wonderful again, and he somehow made me feel like I was the luckiest person in the world.  He lied and told me the car had been wrecked beyond repair in the summer. Recently, I found photos of the same car taken in October and November, three after it had supposedly been wrecked. The next spring he wanted another car. After a number of manipulations and intimidations, he finally convinced me to give him the money for a car. He professed that he would stay with me indefinately regardless of money. I took out a loan for $28,000 and sent a total of $42,000.  A week after the $42,000 arrived, Stanislav said he wanted a new life and would send the money back. When I sent him the bank information, he disappeared from the American internet. A week later I found evidence of a $44,000 Mercedes C55 AMG that was purchased with the money.  Scammer: Stanislav Lukashov 20 yrs old, Model, Student (Economics), 5 feet, 8 inches tall, 65 kg weight. Light brown hair, blue-gray eyes. St. Petersburg, Russia.

"I fell hard for a man who called himself James Mares after weeks of Messaging back and forth.  I had received messages from him interested in getting to know me, but didn’t respond.  Several messages later, still didn’t.  Finally, after a week, he sent a simple “hi.”  I took this opportunity to let him know I wasn’t interested in a relationship; but that I appreciate making friends with whom I have things in common.  Little did I know that this man would become as dear to me as anyone I had ever known, in as little as a month.  Saying he was self-employed Engineer in China, he was preparing to come back to the States…and an hour or less from where I live.  He told me he couldn’t “cash” his final paycheck being in a foreign country heading for the US.  He needed help to finish paying his ticket to the States.  He sent a copy of the ticket, where it indicated he needed $300 or so to pay it off.  The ticket was official looking.  He had sent me pictures of himself at “home” doing things in his yard, etc.  How could I doubt his reality?  His expressions of tenderness and care melted my heart…along with the most loving of poetry…and before I knew it I was as much in love with him as he was with me.  There were red flags throughout, which I pushed aside, wanting to give him the benefit of the doubt.  My friends and daughter told me this was a scam.  But I didn’t want to believe them.  I didn’t hear from him for a week after he should have gotten his flight.  Can’t recall why.  He was staying at a hotel, being charged $285 for each day out of 9 days.  He said he had his “papers” taken by the hotel owners…and was subject to arrest by the Chinese government.  I allowed my heart, rather than my mind, decided to borrow the money for this.  Next thing, he was in an accident on the way to the airport, which killed the taxi driver, and left him in a horrible condition, requiring surgery.  His “doctor” sent me a message that he was unconscious but would contact me.  This does not occur.  Once “awake” he told me he believed my prayers saved him (oh, yes, he did affirm that he, too, was Christian, as am I).  And then, he let me know he had to go to the business office…obviously to discuss what he owed.  I finally woke up to the fact that I was being scammed for money.  I sent him a final e-mail letting him know that, after checking with my bank, learned that he could indeed “cash” his paycheck where he was in order to get back “home.”  And I never heard from him again.  I was plenty abrupt about it.  I didn’t know what a hideous and vile world-wide scam this has become, and how many unfortunate, and trusting, people have fallen victim to their traps.  I have received numerous “friend requests” each month since the scam from other people.  But I am convinced that they are scammers trying to reconnect this “victim.”  I can’t say how much this grieves me.  I have much going on this time in my life, but nothing as EVIL as these CRIMINALS.  I have no friends that can understand, as they’ve never been here.  So, this is my attempt to share my experience…and hopefully find RESOLVE.   Thanks for hearing me out…AW"
"It has been over 2 years since my scam heartbreak. I not only had my heart broken but lost $25,000 of my savings.  It all started when my husband of 25 years dumped me for a 20 year old Asian girl. I was devastated and had to go through all the pain of selling our home, going to solicitors to unravel super and investments, move to another state and find a new home I could afford. My whole world was turned upside down. I was lonely so I decided to go onto a dating site, which I had little experience.  I was contacted by a handsome 65 year old man calling himself Jeff Thomas. He said he was an engineer and lived in Sydney but was willing to relocate as he was about to retire. We chatted through the site then he wanted me to talk through emails and phone. Of course I was keen to meet him face to face.  One day he said he had to return to Malaysia to complete a railway bridge he was building for the Malaysian government. I suggested I could fly up to Sydney to meet him before he left, he agreed and we made arrangements. Well the morning before I was about to fly out he phoned saying he had to leave that morning as there was some problem so we couldn’t get together. After that I had to be content with frequent phone calls, Skype ( typing only as the screen didn’t work for him ? ) and emails .  It was relentless morning, lunch afternoon and late at night, I wondered how he could find this time as he was suppose to be building a railway bridge. He sent me photos of the bridge , I was convinced this was real even though there were many red flags !!!  Well after a couple of months the problems started, firstly he said his wallet had been stolen and all his cards and $70,000 cash to pay his workers. I must admit I did comment how could he fit $70,000 into a wallet, he ignored me. By this time he was talking about us buying a big house, travel the world together etc etc, even marrying when he returned in a couple of months. He sent me a photo of some sort of a contract saying he was going to be paid $15 million for building the bridge.  Then he said because his wallet had been stolen with all his cards he couldn’t get access to his accounts to pay his hotel and even said he had no money for food. He wanted me to send $15,000 ASAP. I explained I was retired and a pensioner and that would take my savings but he started crying and saying he would pay me back plus he was going to buy me a $2 million house that was actually for sale in the town I was living. Well I sent him that money, ( there was a complicated story about that ) .  Then he asked me to sell my cottage that I owned so he could pay his workers all the money he owed them as they had gone on strike. I told him that was impossible, I started to become worried. Then one day I received a phone call from his so called solicitor in Sydney. He said he had been able to get $200,000 together to help Jeff. Then he said he wanted me to travel up to Sydney then I was to travel to Malaysia with $200,000 strapped to my body under my clothes!!!!  I though all this was a joke and said , I am 5’2 inches and would look like the Michelin Man also it is illegal to take that much money out of Australia, I said to him , I will go to jail. He got mad with me then Jeff rang screaming at me saying I didn’t care about him. I finally realised he in fact didn’t care about me and this was a scam.  I talked to my daughter and she talked to the AFP who said this guy was known to them and it was a scam. I reported it to the police, blocked him and cried my heart out for days. I couldn’t believe I was taken by this man and when I spoke to friends they made me feel even worse saying I was stupid and gullible etc etc. so I couldn’t tell them anymore.  It was wonderful being able to talk to someone like Jan and her support group. I am still healing with good and bad days and my financial security is wrecked but I am still here and healthy."
"I am 26 years old, this old is so beautiful. But I am feeling terrible and unfair for my life right now. I don’t know why this happened to my life?  In 10 May 2017, a man sent friend request to me on FaceBook social networking. I didn’t care about this person when he said: ” hi, could he talk to me?’ But after that, he said that he had been fallen in love to me. He wants to take care me, he wants bring his heart to me with his fully love.  We chatted on Viber social networking. Because he wants to close relationships with me. I hadn’t doubt of that. I just simple think that no one doesn’t like to waste their time to me when I said that I have nothing such as money, liability, or even I said that I am a poor person to let him know that he couldn’t get any things from me because I have nothing special in my life. But he said that he doesn’t want it. He wants love from me. I believed this words from his mouth.  And now I realised that it is a joke from scammer who I don’t know. I lost 50,000AUD from this joke of scammer. I tried to ask help from my friends to help the scammer because I believed that he told a trust his story of his life. He said he comes from USA. And he lives with his son who is 9 years old. He is an engineer, And he will go to Turkey for his jobs. He couldn’t pay hotel bill because his credit card has problem with Turkey’s Bank. He couldn’t withdraw his money because the bank has not allowed him to withdraw.  In this time, I said that I couldn’t help him because I really don’t have money. I said that I even have not money to buy food for myself. And he said that he would like to send his credit card to me because I can help him to withdraw money from AUSTRALIA and I have to send his money back to TURKEY through MoneyGram. I said that I couldn’t do it because Australia Governments has not allow me to do it, I can become a criminal if I withdraw money from his card. And he said that no, it is ok and don’t have problems.  I have to help him because his son is in Hospital for treatment his injuries. His son has been broken leg when his son played with another children. I thought of his son, and I said that okey I help him. After this, I received an email from a Fake company which is called FairWay Express. This company’s email said that the parcel is on the way to come to Australia. And the parcel will be sent to me by my address details. But something is happened. Another email from this company said that I have to pay the fee for some Certificate such as : – Import and Export Duty Permit Certificate – Diplomatic Yellow Tag – Anti Terrorist Certificate – United Nations Clearance Bond, and total fee is 15,464 Euros.  I felt this company is fake and I started to doubt this company but I make a mistake when I told to the scammer that this company is a fake company and he said: no…I have to pay this fee immediately because the police will open the parcel and I will get more issues. It makes me feel seriously issues so I tried to get money from some my friends.  When I sent this amount through Commonwealth Bank, after 2 days late I got more an email from this company, they requested me to sent more money because they need to certify all this documents and I need a lawyer to do this and of course I have to pay the fee for lawyer. It is total 11,646 Euros.  I can’t believe and imagine that I have to pay this amount. For me, this amount is large and I don’t have it. The scammer know that I don’t want to pay this amount and he said that his son need to treatment from doctors and I must to get his parcel soonest. And he promised to pay back this amount after I get his parcel. I felt that his son is like my young brother and I tried to get money from my friends again to get the parcel with no doubt that it is scam or fraud. And it is all plan that the scammer created it.  And now I don’t know how to get the help to recovery money to pay back friends. And who will help me to catch this scammer because I want to justice. I reported to ACORN but I received an Automatic reply from them. I believe that the police don’t want to help me and help another victim like me to investigate.  I am really feel depressed and I am just thinking about the death. I am feeling that this world is not good and the heave of God will better than. I don’t know what I have to do because no one help me. Thanks so much."
"Love trap, smat crap… What magic transpires from the controlling of the puppet-meister… When a smooth talking stranger convinces you to part with everything you have… What sucked me in? What pulled me tight?  What trapped my mind, believing that this was right… An escape, my way out…how delicious it tasted, How susceptible was my spirit to the conundrum awaiting… How do I explain the toxic effect of this relationship?  The lure, how tempting, I was easy prey. How lucky for the hunter…this one won`t go away…Stunned like a deer in the headlights bright, my life stood frozen stiff, panicked in total fright. Far beyond my reality, and dangerously so, compelled to meet expectations, I subjugated fully to threats as meted so. How I fell victim to the pressures of his commands, only to please him, my master, they would be set, and off and onward bound.  In my intoxicated state, drunk on the love notes, the promise of escape, I would function like a wind-up doll and operate. At his whim, do what he said unwittingly, without a second’s questioning. The chemical reactions stirring within, had altered my ego, and my id. I was acting way beyond my character, and in my altered state, a stage to perform this drama did begin.  How I reveled in this fantasy…I was engaging in an operation, involved with my lover of sorts, partners in crime, what thrill it gave me this interplay. The drive to meet expectations, of dire circumstance no less, that was the achievement, and how I wanted to prove it…that I was capable, a worthy candidate. I was on a mission, and how fascinating it all seemed, to be part of this quest, ah the intrigue…  The demands were all made via the messenger early, at sunrise, amounts already determined. And like the wind-up doll expressed, on switched the buttons, the functions of the day computed and set. With little sleep from the night before, my mind was entangled in the rapture of the dulcet tones of love, of sweet nothingness only to lighten the blow.  I would awaken next morning to the alarm on my phone reminding me the daylight had come, was I ready to go? Appearing alert, but physically and mentally paying the brunt of this curse, I would set off as usual with my mission firm. Zombie-like in my mental state, on auto-pilot and charged for the day, the next drop, no room for delay. My head brainwashed into believing this was what was expected of me, my duty of great responsibility. My role understood, my focus clear, my mission outlined and ordered. Strapped with the necessary paraphernalia proving legality of my activities, I would with sure footing head to the station.  These addresses I had never ventured, thanks to Google the ease made it better. All the while, we would be connected, he, my master, guiding and protecting. Trusting the exchange would take place, he was keen to see the drops completed early within his time frame. I would head to the bank`s ATM as soon as the cash dispensers were open, hurry into the corner to withdraw for my services. The limit was sufficient for that day`s operation…and off I would go to hunt down the next location.  The frequency of visits, the secession of drops, of demands to be met, raised eyebrows among the local folk. Where was she going they started to ask, among their circles, under the watchful eye. Venturing down more obscure alleyways were these drops to be made. Never before had I been actively involved in the finance of banking; of a frequent resort this was not.  Identification all intact, I would walk in confidently and announce my request. Nerves of steel braced my verve, I was doing this for him, my love, my beau. And with aplomb I would state quite plainly, this was for Egypt, for India, for Africa and for China surely. Here were the details, my next-of kin, my brothers and sisters, what a global union.  They did catch on, these officers here. They sensed the irregularity of my misdeeds. The visitations were too frequent, too closely scheduled, why was she sending so much, all at one time? They started to query further, impending my transaction. The mounting frustration was obvious in my manner; flustered, and fuming, the madam is waiting, I am a businesswoman, don`t keep me hanging. The computer data was all aflame, bright red across the page. The systems could detect anomalies existing, you were sending this amount where? What was the purpose of this remittance?  Towards the end of this cycle of duties fulfilled, the aversion to such establishments, of my visitations crept on both parties’ faces…. The loathing to enter, to handle such requests; the awkwardness of this façade painfully avoiding address… What was she doing with all that money to drop? Had she lost her mind, didn`t she realize this was all a hoax?  Closeted from the outside world for far too long, I was not aware of the harsh realities lurking the corridors. News received here was of domestic focus, the rise of the yen, the price of fish at the market. On occasion something of import would be aired, a main event, like the Olympics or World Cup.  A symptom of this country naivety is endemic; of being overly pampered and protected, can be a precarious position to be in. Sadly ill-informed, ignorant to trouble…ah the devilish antics that await beyond the borders. To be aware is to search independently, otherwise The Bastion of Standards and Compliancy would not hear of it.  And there lies the crux of the issue, I had never heard of romance scams, never knew they existed. Though plenty abounds in the local language and beyond, of finding a partner, of capturing a heart-throb. Had never entertained the thought of seeking a partner online, was never curious about such services, who would be interested in the profile of mine!  Awoken to the world so severe, Was I willing to be intrepid, And journey through this canyon? But I did.  For the dangers, they were beyond my perception, well past my imagination. Scams I understood in the conventional sense, but had never scratched its surface, never sniffed its menacing stench… Seeking a niche in society meant cheating your way, ripping people off, taking advantage of their innocence, are we all victims to this game…?  Fooling the unaware, Coercing their minds, Corrupting their affairs…robbing their dignity, Of not playing fair.  Am I supposed to now believe all are knaves, of fraudulent leanings, craving their next opportunity? I cannot blame anyone but myself… Are you going to punish me for being so gullible…my mind weakened, I was in trouble. Don’t look down on me and feel pity…I have gone beyond such superficiality. Wading my way through all of this, I sometimes stop and wince, how was I so stupid from the beginning?  A desperate need for love unrequited, I jumped quickly in that hoop to find a trap well set up, oh my god, how was I duped!  Was I to please my hunter…was I satisfying enough as the hunted? The bounty at the end was oh so enticing, it was my ticket to escape, my exit from this hostile environment I had grown tired of, had learnt to loathe, even hate. Very little was to sustain me here other than a few contacts, dear students, who, on occasion had made me feel, for a brief moment, normal, real, had extended kindness generously enough to enable a firmer footing here.  Self-loathing had crept in, depression had lurked its ugly head, my dignity all shattered like fine-bone china on the concrete slab.  Naturally I was led to think my ‘pop-up’ to be the solution, the answer to my issues…and I responded. How corrupted of spirit had I become.  In this transition now visible before me, the prevailing remained obscure; hidden to those dear in my circle. I was distant and distracted, bound by this other world; of operations, of master threats, who would have known what spheres I was possessed.  Occasionally the phone would ring. In a gravelly voice he would begin: ‘You are the one, you are mine, What are you talking about? With God`s blessing, we will unite.’  You may ask what the purpose of all that money was, To save a sinking ship, secure loot, gold pieces. Both literally… no really! In hindsight it all sounds a bit hyperbolical, in what day and age are we confronted with such diabolical???  A sense of danger approaching the rough seas, a darkening of skies, a foreboding mirage looming?  Where`s the money, how much can you drop? Please believe me my dear this has to stop. One more deposit, one more exchange, One more arrow, one more cage.  The façade we uphold, maintaining a story, Keeping faith on hold…why do we do what we do? I could easily block the app and withdraw from view. Why don`t you screams my head? I can`t… persists my heart…there is so much unfinished business yet, why do I tread?  I have given him my all, what am I dreaming…a win fall?  I doubt very positively that this will eventuate, with bated breath, I have more than anticipated the outcome of my fate.  Just one more drop, one more deal. How do you think I feel? I am not your money-bags dear, I don`t even earn that much. Do you now want me to turn tricks for you, my love, so as to keep this end of the deal? An affront… I struggle to find solutions yet cannot resist the constant interruption that exists. Hold me strong and don`t let go….  Dear God intervene… I am not of substance, and my nerves are wearing thin…. I indulge him, to keep the channels alight, but at what cost to this blight? Am I letting go or standing still, is there any promise to fulfill? I doubt it. My circumstances have proven thus far, there is nothing to gain from this affair. I have not had a pleasant ride, it has not taken me afar, no delight transpired. Stunted I look for answers and to my dismay, there is nothing but a vacant stare, dull and lifeless, but a pallor veneer reflected in vain.  How do I overcome this dilemma?  Give up immediately and flee forever? What options are presented, what to hold, life is not perfect, accept and move on?  Frustratingly, and in vain, I seek an angle, sometimes bemusing my innermost emotions…Temporarily relieving my thoughts racing in my mind, I then return to the same vicious cycle, weathered over time. Must I surrender to these impasses, or do I valiantly proceed without disaster? The prospects foreboding, the will disturbed, my mind ever confused…pray be still.  There a sumo yukata-clad, balancing precariously on his bicycle, he rides past by me oblivious to the stares. In what world am I surrounded, confusion only blares. A curiosity for certain, inquisitive glances only remind me of the differences existing. I sit in wonder, where will this lead me, am I going to carry such a burden for too much longer? Will he concede and reprieve on the offer?"

" It was two years ago I was in my late 30s with good paying job and a vast network of social life, I just joined the online dating platform for the first time. It was a paid service in US$ worth of US$35 per month because I was serious about looking for a new relationship. (That means the scammer(s) also paid the same to stay on that platform)   Soon after I got a message from a male profile with no photos. Indeed it was the first message. His profile didn’t look overly committing to relationship (Otherwise I would have put off) and I had absolutely zero knowledge about Romance Scam. He soon suggested to chat on WhatsApp (Now I know this is an early sign of a scam) and I agreed. He sent me ‘Hi’ with photos of extremely good looking guy almost too-good-to-be-true (Now I know this guy in the photo is a journalist with an open Instagram account) and I had to admit that I was thrilled by it.     I felt bit weird about the fact he overly talks about the business he runs as soon as we started chatting (Now I know most scammers claim they’re self-employed) felt weird about the fact he types words very quickly (Now I know he was copying and pasting the template replies), felt he was too self-centred by talking about himself without asking much about me (Now I know these are the red flags). But I had no idea about Romance Scam and this is my first experience for online dating so I put my slight doubts aside and went on. (Now I know, you must ALWAYS trust your gut feeling about someone)   For a week we chatted everyday but only chit chat and nothing romantic, then a week later he said he is going to Europe for a business trip as his client there was with a trouble (There you go!). I was also going to be away to other country for holidays in two weeks. (So he had only two weeks to scam me and now I know that’s why he pulled up the plan to lay out the scam at this early stage before setting up a ‘’bond’ creation in between me)     From Europe he sent me a video. It was a video of ‘him’ finishing his morning run routine in the park. I was ecstatic, I don’t know how many times I watched that video. I also found he had a North American accent. (Which goes along with his background he provided) He sent me more photos and messages then bang, sent me this long email and for the first time with passion about his idea of relationship. Basically I was sold for that and wrote him back honestly with most open attitude.(As you can imagine the scam took place right after this)   But at this point I wasn’t in love with him. I can’t be in love with someone I have never met. I guess all I had was just a hope someday I will meet him soon.   Next morning he texted me when I was on the bus saying “Did you read my email? It’s urgent”.   It was a long email about him in need of US$5,000 to pay the for his business. Long story short, I made a quick decision and wired him money. Now I come to think if he was in need of other money such as for hospitalization, I wouldn’t have done it. I think I was scammed because I am a business woman and I think I wanted to appear I understand his business needs. My ego played a role in here. (He used the now-too-obvious tactic of “not having anyone else to depend on but you”. Scammers create the situation where you are the only person in his world to talk to, which at the time I felt weird but again, I didn’t know about this tactic so I went on)   Just when I thought the ‘emergency’ was averted, next day he laid out another emergency situation continuing from the last one with the request of money for US$7,500. I could not believe it and I even told him that my friend was scammed and I am doubting if he was the one. My friend was scammed in the different way it was a marriage scam not online. At the time I thought he could be a scammer but I also thought I would confront him if he comes back from Europe. I told him I can’t send money to someone I have never spoken. I asked him to call me and he agreed.   We set a phone call, him in Europe and me in Asia. It was 3am and first I was alarmed because the line was jammed with noise and that his voice tone was completely different from the video and most notably, he sounded like an Indian not North American. But I was happy to be able to finally hear his voice and I said “Hey you sound different!” and he replied something stupid like he sounds different because he is excited to talk to me.   BIG RED FLAG.   His English was real bad, this confused me because his English was bit wobbly on texts but perfect on Emails. (Now I know the emails are scripted by an native English speaker) He begged for money and I was annoyed by his arrogance and forceful attitude. (Now I know this is typical African scammer attitude) I was confused by inconsistency in his accent but I couldn’t hear him clearly by noise (Now I know they scrambled the line) and it was late at 3am and I was too tired from anxiety by his situation which didn’t make any sense to me. I was crying. So in the end with all these red flags and alarm beeping in my head I gave in and decided to send him money next morning.   Next morning I went to MoneyGram again to wire him US$7,500 to London as I did for the 1st remittance. I was extremely upset by the fact it is all about him since the beginning and I exhausted by him. I didn’t know what or why I was doing this. If you ask me now all I can say is I was under a weird spell. I think this is what it means by you weren’t in control literally. And it was the first experience ever to feel that way for me.   Then I went on my holiday, he was still stuck with his unrealistic situation in Europe and not being able to come back to Asia, but he didn’t ask me the 3rd request while I was on holidays. (Now I know because he knew I can’t send them money particularly after I lied that I emptied my bank a/c which I gave a second thought whether to lie him to protect my savings and honestly, all I was thinking at the time was I didn’t want to appear that I have no money to him and finding excuses that not having much saving.)   On my holiday, we were chatting on WhatsApp. His situation grew gloomier day by day and he sounded depressed day by day. None of this made sense and I started thinking he is bit of an idiot. Red flags all the way but I pushed it aside by thinking maybe he sounds so by stressful situation and he would be normal after this. And if he was a scammer then I would confront him when we finally meet. Why did I think a scammer would meet me? I really don’t know but all I can say is I really just have never heard of this type of scam at all. All I knew was my friend’s case in where she married guy who later turned out a scammer. I guess that made me think at least I would see him later no matter how situation gets worse and that I would not get scammed like my friend did.   When I came back from my holiday, on Day 1 he sent me the 3rd request this time asking me to fly to China to sign on US$1.7M contract with his client as they decided to pay him out and that he can’t fly because now he is sick.   THAT’S when I realised this is a scam as I am in the finance job I know what money laundering is. I gasped for the air for realising the extent of stupidity of myself. It was almost unreal to think I lost US$12,500 like that. But I didn’t make action because I knew this is a money laundering attempt and that I thought I should work with police to bait him out.   Went to the police station they told me to send the case in by email so I did. I waited for police to contact me. But it took too long, I couldn’t hold him for more than 2 weeks pretending I now know I am being scammed by a global criminal syndicate. (I did extensive study online about it) So I blocked him and that was the end of the contact. (Back then I was still thinking authorities can catch the scammers)   A month later police called me in for filing my case officially. They even went to the address he gave me to find no one under his profile lives there. Checked his local phone number to find out it is on the SIM card anyone can purchase at 7/11 and top up. And that his email IP corresponds to Indonesia and Nigeria.   I posted all his information online and few months later a woman from where I live contacted me telling me she too was approached by the guy with same phone number of different name and she told me she called the number and few different Chinese speaking guys picked up the phone and each of them told her the person she is asking for (a white guy) is not there. She thanked me for posting about my scam details so that she didn’t have to be a victim. Few other women contacted me the same.   I can tell from my experiences that you are extremely vulnerable for things you have never heard or encountered in your life. I knew about conventional scams like it happened to my friend (a marriage scam) but NEVER have I imagined of THIS, not perpetrated by a scam-man but by a global criminal syndicate which possibly has connections with other bigger crimes or worse terrorism and their operation is impossible for current authority to bring down.   Often the media portraits the Romance Scam victims are retired lonely women. I, in my late 30s with wide network of friends and social life, had never thought I would be the one. Scammers rarely target young people just because young people usually have no money not because old people are prone to the scams. I hate how media gets this wrong. (Then when they don’t?) Truth is not the victim-centric as they want to scandalously portrait of us, the victims, but it is all about MONEY for the scammers and nothing else. Scammers target men, women, gays, young and old regardless of their profession or educational level as long as the one has MONEY.   If you think you are being scammed but you are not sure, then what I can tell you is NO ONE asks money unless they’re scammers. And all your gut feeling about ‘there is something wrong with him/her’ IS REAL and you shouldn’t doubt if you are being silly because you are NOT."
"I was scammed 2 years ago through a dating site. I was feeling a bit lonely at the time.  His name was Michael Stanton so he told me. I fell in love with this man and believed everything he told me even though my family and friends all told me that it was a scam. He received all my savings amounting to $16000.00. I worked so hard for that money and didn’t hesitate in sending money.  I still have a house and a car and my pension. When l looked back later I couldn’t believe what I had done as I was very good with money and would never considered doing what I had done.  My family wouldn’t talk to me and blamed me and I felt more lonely than I did before.  It finished in January and I had to change my bank account, my credit card my phone numbers, one of my sons rang him in Turkey and told him that I had committed suicide and thought that would be the end. It stopped for about 2 months and one night the phone rang about 4am and they caught me out how I don’t know.  I ruined my life really went to solicitor banks, police, everywhere but no help here in Australia.  My family are now very supportive to me and have helped me but I will never forgive myself as that was their inheritance.  Something strange happened a few months ago and got a man through Facebook requesting to be my friend with a photo. I was really surprised as he looked like the same person. I never reply to these but I answered this and said that he looked liked a man that scammed me. When I explained to him that they used other people’s photos never there own and he asked me if I could send him a copy of this photo I had. I sent him the photo and he sent a larger one of him and with the words he said that it was a good job he had shaved off his moe and said it was a terrible thing for anyone to do."
