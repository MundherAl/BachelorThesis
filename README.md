## Abstract
Cybercrime is a growing threat to both organizations and individuals. The financial damages caused by cybercrime are very high, but an underresearched consequence of cybercrime is the psychological impact it has on victims. This paper aims to apply modern text analysis methods, namely topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to a corpus of stories of victims who have had encounters with cybercrime. The goal is to identify the topics that victims talk about and the sentiment of their stories. However, topic models and sentiment analyses have their limitations which seem to have affected the results of this paper.
