# The State of Cybercrime and security: A Review.

## Introduction

The number of internet users has been steadily on the rise and projected to continue to rise. As digitalization expands, particularly since the outbreak of COVID-19, instances of cybercrime have similarly been increasing, despite being significantly underreported ( #TODO: add source). This raises questions about the occurrence rate of cybercrime, how its damages will scale and about the approaches to combating cybercrime. The proposal is a thesis, that will provide an in-depth discussion on cybercrime and security with a focus on cybercrime victims and technology-empowered solutions.

## Background and Significance

The amount of internet users world-wide has increased from about 1 billion to 5.3 billion in the period between 2005 and 2022 . This figure is expected to continue growing, as well as cybercrime, despite being severely underreported. Cybercrime has very significant financial costs that are also projected to increase at a high rate. According to the Europol's Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), cybercrime is becoming more aggressive and confrontational. Such crimes include but are not limited to online fraud, sexual extortion as well as child abuse. The effects of such crimes can be very severe ( #TODO : add source). 

The growth of internet usage and the rate of cybercrime is a cause for great concern for a number of reasons:
1. a 6% compound annual growth rate in internet users introduces billions of potential victims. ( #TODO: add source)
2. Low levels of education against cybercrime prevention. ( #TODO: add source)
3. Lack of awareness about the psychological and financial damages to victims. ( #TODO: add source)
4. The effects of cybercrimes on victims being under-researched, leading to less actionable strategies against cybercrime. ( #TODO: add source)

The sum of these reasons implies a highly neglected cause. However, there is reason to believe that there is much potential for things to improve. The cybersecurity job market currently has 1 million jobs and is projected to grow to 3.4 million in ( #TODO: add year and source) years. Companies like RSA also believe that cybersecurity is a market with high potential for profit ( #TODO: add source). There has also been developments in rethinking cybersecurity models and frameworks ( #TODO: add source). Although this might mean a great deal of potential for innovations in prevention, it has no implications for financial and psychological recovery for victims.

## Research Methods

The thesis will analyze literature, models and frameworks on cybercrime and security.

## Expected Outcomes

The paper will use existing literature to examine the effects of cybercrime on victims, discuss the current state of cybercrime prevention and support networks of victims. Through analyzing the evidence and discussing current cybersecurity solutions and frameworks, the paper will provide actionable strategies and technology-empowered solutions against cybercrime and discuss them as well.
