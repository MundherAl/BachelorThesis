<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >The number of internet users has been steadily on the rise and projected to
continue to rise. As digitalization expands, particularly since the outbreak of
COVID-19, instances of cybercrime have similarly been increasing [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#XMonteith2021Increasing">6</a></span>], despite
being signiﬁcantly underreported. [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#XIOCTA2021">3</a></span>] This raises many questions about
cybercrime and security. Among those questions is the eﬀect of cybercrimes such
as phising and identity theft on victims.
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Background and Signiﬁcance</h3>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >The amount of internet users world-wide has increased from about 1 billion to 5.3
billion in the period between 2005 and 2022. [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#XStatistaInternetUsers">7</a></span>] This ﬁgure is expected to
continue growing, as well as cybercrime [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xrise-of-cybercrime">5</a></span>], although it is severely underreported.
Cybercrime has very signiﬁcant ﬁnancial costs that are also projected to increase
at a high rate. According to the Europol’s Internet Organized Crime Threat
Assessment (IOCTA) [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#XIOCTA2021">3</a></span>], cybercrime is becoming more aggressive and
confrontational. Such crimes include but are not limited to cyberstalking, sexual

extortion as well as child abuse. The eﬀects of such crimes can be very
severe. [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#XIOCTA2021">3</a></span>]
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   Many cybercrimes are carried out at a mass scale with very low costs.
For example, phising attacks can be carried out with very little cost.
Another example are DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks are performed by bots,
are accessible to any individual, and can be carried out for as little as
10 USD. [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xgomez2020dark">4</a></span>] There are many estimations on the ﬁnancial costs of such
attacks on individuals and companies, and they seem to be signiﬁcant.
Cybercrimes are estimated to cost the world economy about 8 trillion USD in
2023. [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xcybersecurity-ventures-cybercrime-report">8</a></span>] However, the psychological costs of such crimes are not as well
studied.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   The growth of internet usage and the rate of cybercrime is a cause for great
concern for a number of reasons:
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2002x1">a 6% compound annual growth rate in internet users introduces billions
      of new potential victims. [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#XStatistaInternetUsers">7</a></span>]
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2004x2">Limited levels of awareness against cybercrime prevention. [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xenisa-raising-awareness">2</a></span>]
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-2006x3">Unknown  levels  of  awareness  about  the  psychological  and  ﬁnancial
      damages to victims.</li></ol>
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   The sum of these reasons implies a highly neglected cause. However, there is
reason to believe that there is much potential for things to improve. The number
of unﬁlled cybersecurity jobs has grown from one million to 3.5 million between
2013-2021. [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xcybersecurity-ventures-cybercrime-report">8</a></span>] McKinsey believes that there may be a big addressable
market for cybersecurity. As of 2021, The total addressable market is
predicted to be valued between 1.5 trillion to 2 trillion dollars, which is
about 10 times as big as the vended market. [<span class="cite"><a 
href="#XMcKinsey2022Survey">1</a></span>] There has also been
developments in rethinking cybersecurity models and frameworks with
companies like RSA focusing on identity authentication and authorization.
Although this might mean a great deal of potential for innovations in
prevention, it has no implications for ﬁnancial and psychological recovery for
victims.

   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Research Methods</h3>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >The research will perform a sentiment analysis on social media posts and
comments as well as online forums and discussion boards.
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Expected Outcomes</h3>
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >The paper will provide a better understanding of the psychological eﬀects of
cybercrime on victims. Based on the results, the paper will discuss the ﬁndings
and propose suggestions for future research on the topic.
