\subsection{Conclusion}

The thesis used state-of-the-art methods to analyze stories told by cybercrime victims but revealed no useful insights about the topics that victims speak about. This may support the claim that coherence is not an appropriate measure for topic models, but could also indicate that the data itself is not suitable for LDA.

Victims tended to neutrally speak about their experiences, rather than adding much sentiment to their stories. The findings are by no means conclusive and further research is crucial for further understanding the matter of cybercrime victimization.
