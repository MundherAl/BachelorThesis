\subsection{Data Analysis}

A total of 3489 stories will be analyzed in two parts: a topic model using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and a sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. The topic model will be used to identify the most common topics in the stories and the sentiment analysis will be used to identify the sentiment of the stories.
