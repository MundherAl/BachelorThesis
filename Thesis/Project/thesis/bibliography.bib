    abstract = "{Unlike many other types of crime, it is possible to make a good estimate for when the first cybercrimes occurred. It is unfortunately much more difficult to clearly define and categorize cybercrime, despite attempts by many key researchers in the field to do so. This chapter describes various types of cybercrime and presents typologies of cybercrime proposed by various researchers. It considers the problems in quantifying cybercrime and presents various reasons why such crimes may not be reported by victims or witnesses or recorded by law enforcement agencies. It provides an overview of various methods by which cybercrime can be prevented, including policing, diversion, deterrence, and developing target resistance. For many of these, psychological insights can help to provide guidance in the deterrence of offenders and preventative measures of targets.}",
