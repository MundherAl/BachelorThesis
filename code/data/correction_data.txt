I am an investigative journalist and did a research on the Sugar Mummy scam circus in Singapore. They all operate the same way. No one is what they say they are. I contacted 6 of the agents on Locanto and other sites via WhatsApp and they were all scammers. They might change names but one thing is for 100% sure. You will be scammed! Basically they have a pre-paid phone card with a generic profile photo. They all asure you they are not scammers. After giving them you name, age and civil status they will ask for 300-500 SGDs for a fee. They only accept bank transfer. Then when you have payed this they ask for 1400-1900 SGD for further fees and insurance. They promise you a BMW and a monthly salary of at least 10500 SGD and so on. My conclusion is "DON´T PAY ANYTHING" They are all scammers/fraudsters/liers. Don´t fall for any sweet talk or promises, you will be fooled and no sugar mummy is at the end of the rainbow. No matter who they say they are or that they have lots of clients that recommend them, nothing they say is true. The old saying goes: -How can you tell a scammer is lying? Their lips move... My investigation is complete and I am willing to hand it over to the SPF for further handling. BE AWARE! All suger mummy agents ARE SCAMMERS!
