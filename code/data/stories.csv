I accepted a friend request on Facebook because we had a common friend. We chatted on Facebook Messenger and did some basic verification by asking questions, which seemed believable. We then decided to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. This "friend" attempted to develop a close relationship by asking personal questions and showing concern for various issues I had. After some time, they asked me to help them with a part-time job they were doing. They claimed that if I didn't assist, it would indicate a lack of sincerity in our friendship. I accepted the request but remained cautious, even though I didn't know much about the background of the job. The task involved processing sales orders for a supposedly reputable company. I was asked to use my own money to purchase items using the product value provided in links sent by the "company" through Paynow. To help my friend, I needed to complete a certain number of orders. Initially, the purchase amount was small, around $100. After completing a few orders and being fully reimbursed along with commission, the subsequent orders' amounts quickly ballooned into the thousands. Feeling uncomfortable, I decided to stop paying for the orders. When I raised my concerns about this issue, my "friend" began to change their behavior and accused me of not completing the orders intentionally to cause problems for them. They insisted that I fulfill the job due to an alleged contract and threatened that they would face penalties otherwise. Refusing their demands led to them hurling expletives at me and instructing me not to contact them again. I immediately took screenshots of all their details and ceased communication. Fortunately, I didn't lose any money during the process, but my banking details were compromised. I reported the incident to the police. Reflecting on the situation, the scammer was well-prepared in answering various questions and made a concerted effort to build a seemingly sincere relationship. When the time came, they resorted to emotional blackmail and questioned my integrity to manipulate me into assisting them. I urge others to remain vigilant for red flags in their responses, conduct internet searches to verify the information provided, and immediately cease contact to avoid becoming emotionally entangled with scammers, which can result in financial losses.

I met Alan on Bumble, where he claimed to be a project manager at Synergix in Jurong East. He mentioned that he lived in Geylang and hailed from Kuala Lumpur. We chatted for about a week, and things seemed to be going well. He showed a lot of interest in me, complimenting me and assuring me that he would support me through my depression. However, the next day, I discovered that he had unmatched me on Bumble and claimed to have uninstalled the app. Then, he sent me a message showing a graph of SGX stocks, explaining that he was making extra money from it because his $7,000 salary wasn't sufficient to cover his $2,000 rent and family expenses. He mentioned that his brother had taught him about stocks, or else he would have lost a significant amount of money. He said he thought I was a nice girl and offered to teach me some tips in exchange for a meal. This made me even more suspicious, so I turned him down. He proceeded to guilt-trip me, suggesting that this was why people found it difficult to be friends with me. I pointed out that I recognized the phrases and words he used from previous encounters, after which he stopped messaging me. The following day, I attempted to contact Synergix to inquire about an employee named Alan working as a project manager. However, the person I spoke to informed me that no such position existed.
I connected with a person named Arno on the CMB app on June 3, 2023. We had normal conversations, and on June 9, he asked to exchange phone numbers and continue chatting on WhatsApp. He would talk about his daily life and work, often using WhatsApp calls to chat. According to him, he is from Malaysia and studied at Inti International University and College Malaysia. He claimed to own a 3.7 million worth condominium near Orchard and a car, which he purchased from his aunt who migrated to Australia. Arno shared that he worked under his boss, David, who is the head of the Department of SEA Ltd. He claimed to have connections with David, allowing him to invest in private equity projects exclusive to high-end members. These projects involved HDB projects and more. About a week into chatting on WhatsApp, he suddenly informed me that he urgently needed to go to Kuala Lumpur as his grandmother had fallen and hit her head. He showed me a picture of his grandmother admitted to Hospital Pantai KL. A few days later, he shared another picture of his grandmother after her operation. He then asked for my help to visit an HDB worksite and take photos, to give him reassurance regarding his $0.5 million investment in the project's progress. Later, he claimed that he managed to get David's help to let me join the private equity platform called "SoftUni" as a token of appreciation. He immediately insisted that I join without allowing me time to consider. The registration process required my legal name and NRIC. The next day, Arno informed me about small-scale projects that I could join, each requiring a passcode for access. Arno recommended three successful investments, and I received funds through withdrawals. However, in the latest investment on June 30, 2023, he informed me that my funds were frozen due to an incorrect password entered during the withdrawal process, even though I'm confident that I entered the correct password. I reached out to customer service for resolution and was told that I needed to transfer the same amount to unfreeze my funds. Arno convinced me to follow the advice from customer service. After transferring the funds, the initial amount was unfrozen. When I tried to withdraw the entire amount, the withdrawal was rejected. I contacted customer service and was informed that I needed to transfer an additional amount of $50,000 to perform the withdrawal. At this point, I realized it was a scam and conducted some research on scam alerts. I found similar stories with the same modus operandi. Moreover, I confirmed that this person Arno was the same person mentioned by a victim who shared her real story and mentioned that this guy actually belongs to an individual named Felix Go (@HelixGo on Instagram who got impersonated). This has been an expensive lesson, but I want to urge everyone to be extra cautious and not believe anyone who asks you to invest immediately without giving you time to consider.
A person with the online name "June lee" initially contacted me through Facebook and expressed interest in being friends. Afterward, they added me on WhatsApp. Within One day of chatting, they shared how much they could confide in me and requested my assistance in fulfilling some orders for their part-time job. This "part-time job" involved placing orders for Louis Vuitton products as part of a sales campaign. They claimed that a third-party merchant would reimburse me the principal amount plus a commission for any orders placed, with no physical delivery of the products. Although I voiced my suspicions about the scheme, they assured me that this was a common practice in e-commerce to artificially boost their sales figures. Subsequently, the person prompted me to message a Whatsapp business account, called "Louis Vuitton online Service" Knowing this was clearly a scam due to the speed at which the "close confidant" relationship was achieved, i decided to drag my feet and terminate the long con. At that point, the tone of the person claiming to be my lover, "june lee" abruptly changed and they requested that I stop talking to them and not contact them again.
I was contacted on Telegram by a girl named Jennifer. She asked if I was interested in a job offer, and if so, someone else would contact me on WhatsApp in a few hours or days. Afterward, Jennifer's account was deleted. Later, another girl named Wei En contacted me via WhatsApp. She sent me the job description and attempted to engage in personal conversations multiple times. However, I ignored her and fabricated fake stories, including a false name and age. Wei En informed me that the "position" they were offering had a salary of $500 for every 5 days, with additional bonuses ranging from $50 to $200. It sounded appealing, right? When I asked if I needed to go to the office, Wei En replied, "I think working from home is better for you, so you don't have to quit your job." When I agreed to proceed, Wei En mentioned that I would need to undergo training. She added me to a group that was filled with scammers. She then sent me a link and asked me to create an account. However, after creating the account, she requested that I log out and use her "trainee" account instead. While in her account, I was assigned various "tasks," which involved completing surveys. For each survey I completed, I would earn 1% of the amount specified on the survey. However, during the surveys, I encountered something called "survey rewards," which required me to deposit my own money to complete the surveys. During the training, the person who contacted me via WhatsApp would assist in depositing the money. Only after the training was completed did they disappear with my money.
Scammer: Hello! Just wanted to inform you that I changed my number. Contact me using this new number next time. Me: Who are you? Scammer: Huh, you don't remember? I only changed my number, not my voice. Me: So what? I genuinely don't remember. Just tell me who you are. Scammer: Nevermind, I'll send you a WhatsApp message. Me: No need, I won't transfer any money to you. Hang up.
A few days ago, someone called claiming to be my old friend, Mr. Chua, who stayed in Malaysia. He said he was in Singapore opening a restaurant at Northpoint, with the opening ceremony scheduled for this Sunday. When I asked for the address, he mentioned losing his wallet and phone in a restroom and needing to make a police report. Today, on July 6th, he called again, saying he couldn't find his wallet and was out of money. He asked me to send him some money, citing our long-standing friendship. I agreed but wanted to confirm his identity by asking a few simple questions about our shared experiences and work. He avoided answering and when I mentioned meeting at China Town Complex Hawker Center, he abruptly ended the call. I discovered that both calls came from the same Singaporean number: 88536095. I contacted my friend Mr. Chua, who informed me he was in Kuala Lumpur, hadn't visited Singapore, and hadn't contacted me. He confirmed that this was a scam. I attempted to file a police report at Cantonment Police Station but left as there was only one service counter available, opting to use the e-service for reporting instead.
The caller will somehow know your first name, speak in a mixture of Mandarin and English, and not identify themselves. They will ask why you have forgotten their voice, which is an obvious impersonation scam. It is best to hang up and block the number right away.
I received calls and messages offering me an opportunity to make money by writing reviews, promising a payment of S$15. They then presented another money-making method, involving advanced tasks. These tasks were assigned to groups of 3-4 people, and although it seemed like random selection, I suspected the others were their team members. To participate in the advanced task, they asked me to transfer S$800, with a promise of S$1040 in return. The second task required an investment of S$3999, which they claimed would yield S$6000. They added an additional task to recover all my money, increasing the payment to S$9999. I refused to pay at this point, but they informed me that I couldn't withdraw my money halfway. To retrieve my funds, I somehow managed to arrange the large sum they requested. However, they used the excuse that I had delayed the task, demanding an additional S$15000 to recover all my money. I have chat messages as proof of our interactions. I realize I was foolish to fall for their scam, but I hope the police can assist me in recovering my money and putting an end to these scams that deceive hardworking individuals.
I met a guy on a social app who offered to teach me about investing. We moved our conversations to Telegram, where he introduced me to two apps: crypto.com and Max Magic Exchange (MME). He seemed friendly and helpful, providing step-by-step instructions on how to use the apps. He claimed to have two years of trading experience on MME and said he learned about investing from his uncle, whom he currently worked for in Singapore. He presented himself as a Taiwanese looking for new local friends.As we continued interacting, he encouraged me to invest larger amounts on MME after showing me a few successful investments. However, I became suspicious due to several occurrences:He strongly advocated for MME, even when I raised concerns about the lack of information on the site and received no response from their customer service.Whenever I requested to withdraw profits and my initial investment, he threatened me with timed penalties (often within 7 days). For instance, he asked me to deposit a larger sum to avoid a penalty deduction of 30% to 50% from my account balance.He consistently requested larger and more absurd deposits each time.Every time I tried to withdraw my funds, he came up with ridiculous excuses to prevent the withdrawal. These reasons ranged from not having enough investment activities logged, insufficient deposits for the requested amount, and even a demand for a 25% national tax payment on my total earnings. He also claimed that my earnings were too significant to be transferred out and required an additional deposit.I sincerely hope that this warning reaches potential victims before any disastrous consequences occur. Unfortunately, I came across a similar cautionary tale (posted by "Anonymous" on June 2, 2023) too late. Please be cautious and avoid blind investments.
Someone contacted me, claiming to be a critic of Pacific View Media, and asked me to complete a movie-related survey. They mentioned that I would receive S$16.6 as compensation. After completing the survey, I informed them that I didn't have PayNow (which they requested for payment). I told them not to send me the money. In response, they insisted that I only needed to provide my PayNow details to receive the payment and asked me to collect it. I reiterated that I didn't have PayNow and they suggested that I register for it, questioning why I didn't already have it and asking for my age. I explained that I was a teenager and didn't have a job, which is true. They appeared slightly annoyed and said they wouldn't bother me if I didn't want to use PayNow. I pointed out that their country code indicated Nigeria, but they didn't respond to that message.
I met someone named Arno on the CMB app on June 15, 2023. We had normal conversations, and on June 18, he asked to switch to WhatsApp and shared that his name is Weijie. Everything seemed fine, and he would talk about his daily life and family. He claimed to have studied a double degree in Business Management and Food Sciences at the University of Sydney. He originally hails from Malaysia but moved to Singapore seven years ago with the intention of becoming a permanent resident by the end of the year.He mentioned having an aunt who is a doctor in Singapore and stated that he runs his own company located at Aljunied Road. He also mentioned living at Ascentia Sky, Alexander View.During our conversations, he mentioned being a close friend of David Chen, the co-founder of Sea Group, and through his connections, he could invest in private equity involving HDB projects and more. A week after chatting on WhatsApp, he suddenly informed me that he needed to urgently go to Kuala Lumpur as his grandma had fallen and hit her head. Despite this, he asked for my help to visit an HDB BTO worksite and take some photos so that he could confidently invest $500,000 in the project. Later that evening, he told me that he managed to get David's help to grant access to an app called SoftUni, which could only be downloaded through a link he provided, and via VPN since the app isn't available on the Apple Store in Singapore. The app registration required my legal name and NRIC.Three successful investments were made for projects recommended by Weijie, and funds were returned to me through withdrawals. However, in the latest investment on June 30, 2023, he informed me that my funds were frozen due to an incorrect password entered during the withdrawal process, even though I'm certain I didn't make a mistake. I reached out to customer service for resolution and was told that I needed to transfer the same amount of investment before my account could be unfrozen and my password changed. At this point, I became convinced it was a scam and did some research on scam alerts, finding similar modus operandi. Furthermore, I confirmed that the photos Weijie had sent of himself actually belonged to an individual named Felix Go (@helixgo on Instagram).This has been an expensive lesson for me, but I want to urge everyone to be cautious when receiving photos from individuals, as they could be stolen from someone else. Also, don't be fooled by apps that may appear legitimate but are actually scams.
I met a guy in CMB between May and June. He claims to live in Holland V, works as a project manager at Wizlynx, and every day at 10pm, he says he's busy generating reports. He sent me some BTO videos, but didn't ask me to invest because I told him I'm broke and scammers won't get anything from me.I was skeptical and noticed something suspicious in his meal photo, so I asked him if he's a scammer. This made him angry, and we had a quarrel. He insisted that he didn't ask me for money and had no reason to scam me. The next day, he flew to Jakarta and claimed that his camera functions were switched off for security reasons. After that, he became unreachable until three weeks later when he suddenly reappeared and started asking for sexy pictures, saying it was a small act of romance. I refused and suggested meeting up to establish a genuine relationship. However, he didn't share any other contact details or social account IDs when I asked for them. The next day, he told me he wasn't interested in being in a relationship with anyone. When I called him a scammer again, he blocked me.After many days, I discovered that his Telegram account had changed to aziel_tan1028, and I suspect he's trying to scam people with a new identity.
He called me and refused to reveal his identity, but when I mentioned my friend's name, he confirmed it was him. Two days later, he texted me asking how to update his bank account with a new number. I assisted him. Then, he approached me, claiming he needed to transfer funds to a contractor but couldn't due to a waiting period for changing account details. He asked for my help and provided the number of a person named Ivan at 90368??? (PAY NOW). I didn't comply with his request. He then texted me from two different numbers: 84612876 and 93435167. He showed me a receipt for the contractor's invoice, but he deleted it before I could take a screenshot. I also reported the incident through the ScamShield app.
I met a girl named 晓晓 on Telegram, and we agreed to meet at 335 Sembawang Close. When I reached there, she asked for my phone number, claiming that her boss needed to contact me to verify that I wasn't from the police. Her boss called me and demanded that I purchase a $150 iPhone gift card. Recognizing it as a scam, I immediately told him to cancel the entire transaction. After hanging up, like other victims have mentioned, he continued to call and send threatening messages/videos. I have blocked all the numbers starting with +60121...
I was contacted on WhatsApp by someone named Bridget Smith from AngusOne Staffing Employment Agency, offering part-time work from home to earn extra money. They claimed I could make CAD$50-80 per hour or CAD$300-600 per week. When I asked for more details, I was referred to Gavin. Gavin was not very forthcoming in answering my questions but mentioned that the job involved optimizing data for Priceline. Once I agreed to try the job, I was instructed to download a crypto wallet app like Newton from the app store. Then, I was directed to visit a website (https://tech-pricelineonline.com) and create a Priceline Work Account using the invitation code 18950768. After creating my account, I was given a login with the username "Gavin1002" and password "123456" to access the training. During the training, I encountered combination tasks where the hotel prices would combine and cause a negative balance in my account. To clear the negative balance, I was asked to deposit additional funds. The tasks for the "VIP 1" level involved optimizing data for 40 hotels, and I encountered several combination tasks that required me to deposit small amounts of money to clear the negative balances. After completing tasks for 5 days, I received $800 USD as my "salary" in my account. Unfortunately, I forgot to withdraw this amount before starting the next set of tasks. As a result, the value of the hotels increased, leading to increased profit. I contacted customer service on the platform and they assured me that the chances of encountering another combination task were almost zero. Believing them, I proceeded to deposit the money. However, when I reached the 40th task of that set, I encountered another combination task that required me to deposit $10,600 USD to clear the negative balance. I was told that this would be the last task and I could withdraw all my money after completing it. Before depositing the money, I asked customer service if there was any possibility of encountering further obstacles, and they assured me there were none. However, after depositing the money and clicking submit, I was upgraded to "VIP 2" due to the amount deposited. The "VIP 2" task sets required 50 individual tasks per set. As I continued with the tasks, I encountered another combination task that would require me to deposit an additional $23,034.31 to complete the set. At this point, I refused to deposit any more money, and customer service mentioned they would negotiate with the Merchant and the Platform to find a resolution. Realizing my mistake, I have decided to cut my losses. I understand that the chances of recovering any of my money are extremely low.
I connected with a girl named Lisa on Telegram, and she suggested meeting at the Midview located at 1??? Upper Serangoon Rd, Singapore 534???. Upon reaching there, she asked me for my phone number, claiming that a validation call was necessary because she was a 'student'. Subsequently, a person claiming to be from 369 contacted me and refused to accept cash. Instead, they instructed me to go to the nearest 7-11 store and purchase a $200 iTunes gift card. They asked me to take a picture of the code and provide it to them. At this point, I became suspicious and decided to block both Lisa and the person contacting me. However, the person continued to use multiple unknown numbers to send me pictures of bloodied and beaten up individuals, along with threats towards my family. Be careful, guys!
I encountered an individual named Dexter Koh Wei Ming on the dating app CMB. He claimed to be a business development manager with PR status in Singapore. We continued our conversation on Telegram, where he used charming messages to gain my trust. He shared various aspects of his life, including family, work, and expressed a strong desire for a relationship. He even mentioned introducing me to his family in Taman Desa, Kuala Lumpur. One day, he asked for a favor to help with site reconnaissance for a BTO project as part of a private crowdfunding initiative. He then informed me that his boss had secured me a spot on a private crowdfunding app operated by SEA Limited. He guided me through the account setup process and instructed me on how to proceed with investments and projects. Although initially hesitant, I eventually compromised and transferred an initial amount of $500 into the account. Over time, the scammer exploited my vulnerabilities and doubts, increasing the requested amount from $500 to $30,000. Unfortunately, I realized I had been deceived and was unable to retrieve the deposited amount or the supposed "profits" as the scammer had frozen the fraudulent account. The fake customer service officer in the fraudulent app demanded an additional $15,000 to unfreeze the account for identity verification. Furthermore, my personal details, including my name, NRIC, and bank account information, were entered into the fraudulent account. Please exercise caution if you encounter someone using the CMB account and claiming to be Koh Wei Ming/Khoo Wei Ming. The photos used by the scammer were of low resolution and extracted from the internet, impersonating someone else.
Beware of a fraudulent scheme involving 'SingSale' marketing. I was contacted by individuals who provided a link and offered $3 for each like. Initially, I earned $9 from this arrangement. Subsequently, they sent another link with a mission to make a purchase, claiming a merchant would provide a $17 profit. Tempted by the offer, I proceeded. Then, they introduced another link, describing it as a group project involving four people. I was asked to choose a package and selected the second-lowest option, priced at $277. The participation required three to four purchases: the first one costing $277, the second one $999, and the third one $3,988. This raised concerns, and I questioned their intentions, ultimately deciding to stop at the second purchase. I transferred funds to the accounts they provided for payments.. Unfortunately, I ended up losing a total amount of S$1,287.00. Please be cautious and avoid falling victim to such scams.
Beware of a scam involving a survey sent through WhatsApp. Initially, I thought it was a harmless survey and decided to participate. However, they redirected me to Telegram and instructed me to add a user with the username "Millo335" and send a quote - "TY62704". Surprisingly, this individual transferred SGD 15 to me via PayNow after I provided them with my phone number. Later, I went online to research the company this person claimed to represent and discovered that it was indeed a scam. It's essential to exercise caution and remain vigilant when sharing personal information or engaging in such activities online. Editor's Note: If something seems suspicious, it is best to verify the legitimacy of the organisation before proceeding further.
The night before, the scammer will call you and claim to be someone you know, like Yenny. They will tell you that they lost their wallet and phone, and the number they are using is their new one. The scammer's voice will sound exactly like the real person, further convincing you that it is indeed Yenny. They will instruct you to delete the old number and use this new one instead. Additionally, they will inform you that they are no longer working at their previous restaurant and have opened a new cafe with a partner. The scammers have access to personal information about the real person, such as their workplace. If you're not vigilant enough, you may easily fall for their deceptive tactics, just like I did. (I am one such victim.) The following day, in the afternoon, the scammer will call again, claiming that their supplier is outside their cafe. However, due to their lost phone, they cannot make the payment to the supplier. They will then ask for your help to use PayNow to transfer money to the supplier. The scammer will request their business partner to provide you with the supplier's PayNow number and ask for your assistance. The most critical part of the scam is when they promise to repay you within two hours. This is a ploy to exploit our kindness. Please remember not to transfer any money to them.
I recently received a message on WhatsApp from a person named Rosa at Indeed Recruitment Company, who recommended a new job opportunity. Shortly after, I was contacted by a woman named Alethea/Alecia who provided details about an online part-time job. The job seemed promising, offering an attractive base salary along with commission. It involved spending approximately one hour each day clicking a button to submit data. Initially, the job seemed legitimate as I was able to withdraw money quickly after completing each task. The requirement was to complete a minimum of two tasks per day in order to register it as a working day. However, on the second day while performing the tasks, I noticed some unusually high-value tasks appearing sporadically, which required additional funds to unlock. I became skeptical when I was asked to transfer task reset funds to a personal account. After completing two high-value tasks, I was asked to top up my account with $2500. Subsequently, another larger task came up, requiring an additional top-up of $3065. It was at this point that I became extremely suspicious of the entire situation.
It started on a Instagram chat message saying that I won a giveaway and they told me to continuously buy apple gift cards since it was an Apple phone giveaway. I have lost $700 in cash so far and they still want me to buy $200 more in Apple giftcards.
I met Leo on the CMB app, and he was very responsive and interested in getting to know me. Within the first day, he suggested moving our chats to WhatsApp, which I agreed to. Leo would send daily updates and constantly inquire about my activities and meals. We had frequent communication and nightly phone calls, where he would share details of his day, creating the illusion of a relationship.Leo had a Malaysian accent and spoke Chinese. His English proficiency was limited. He claimed to work at Garena under the supervision of Gangye, one of the co-founders. According to him, he lived at Margaret Ville condo and owned a white Porsche. He boasted about having a personal assistant and claimed a monthly salary of 30k with an annual compensation of 1.7m. He described his role as heading the sales operations team at Garena and mentioned traveling four times a year to oversee the regional team.Occasionally, Leo would try to extract more information from me, such as my monthly salary and spending habits.One week into our conversations, Leo abruptly messaged me at 2:47 am, stating that he had to rush to Kuala Lumpur as his grandmother had fallen and was hospitalized. Despite this, he continued to call me at night, shifting the topic to his investments in BTO projects. He sent me a website link for a BTO project near my house and claimed that he needed my help to take a picture of the site the next day, or else he would miss the opportunity to invest.Feeling suspicious, I questioned why HDB would require money for BTO projects. Leo's explanation about COVID-related delays and a temporary 60-day loan to HDB did not convince me. When he mentioned a 20% return on the investment, I knew it was unrealistic, given my own knowledge of the finance industry. I immediately conducted an internet search on love scams and discovered that he was indeed a scammer.
I received an email from "notifications@link.com" claiming to be from TransitLink and EZLink. However, after verifying with both companies, it was confirmed that they did not send the email.Email details: From: notifications@link.com Date: Wed, 21/Jun/2023The email requests to verify my email address by clicking on a link provided. It promotes "Link" as a secure payment method at SimplyGo EZLink and other businesses. It emphasizes data privacy, mobile verification, and security standards.If assistance is needed for purchases from SimplyGo EZLink, the email suggests contacting bajibabu@ezlink.com.sg or visiting their website. To manage the Link account and view purchase history, logging in at link.com or visiting their support site is advised.This email was not legitimate and should be treated as suspicious.
I fell into a scam trap when someone approached me for help with their part-time job. Initially, I made a transfer of $100 to a seemingly verified LV customer service account and received some money back. The person kept asking for more help, and in a moment of vulnerability, I continued transferring money. It quickly escalated, and I ended up losing control, eventually reaching $25,000. Realizing the depth of the situation, a friend helped me regain my senses, and we immediately filed a police report and contacted the bank. Despite the account being frozen, recovering the funds is unlikely as they may have been transferred overseas. Early reporting has slim chances of success as well. Please remember to never send money to someone you've only met online and avoid blindly trusting anyone. I sincerely hope that this doesn't happen to anyone else under any circumstances and that it doesn't escalate as it did in my case.
I received a random text on Whatsapp: "Hello!!! It's a pleasure to virtually meet you😊, I'm Anabia from Ninja Van Customer Service. We are doing an paid survey so we can finish our ranking report.

i was approached by this person in instagram and we exchanged contact number. after 2 days of conversation, she informed me about her second job which is helping louis vuitton (lv) in completing certain task order through online store and commission of 5% will be provided. at the same time, i need to transfer the amount to a random personal bank account number in order to receive the commission. Given the typical nature of scam and the reputation of LV, i got skeptical and tried to push back by telling her that i do not have a bank account to make the transfer. Thankfully, nothing was lost from my side.
I received a friend request on Facebook from a woman with an attractive profile picture. Curious, I accepted her request. She immediately reached out to me, claiming she rarely uses Facebook and suggested we chat on WhatsApp instead (number: 84831876). In our conversations, she mentioned that she is a permanent resident with a Singaporean father and a Malaysian mother. Despite being Chinese, she occasionally typed in Chinese.We continued chatting, getting to know each other as new friends. She shared details about her daily life and seemed sincere in our interactions. She told me she was 28 years old and working in HR. Additionally, she mentioned having a part-time job at Style Tribute, where she needed to handle numerous orders.After a couple of days, she complained about working late into the night to complete orders for Style Tribute, expressing discomfort in her neck and other issues. She even invited me for a coffee date. However, she added a condition: she needed my help to complete her orders so she could sleep early.I sensed something was amiss with her request. How could she trust a new friend she barely knew for just two days? When I refused to assist her, she asked if I shopped online. I falsely claimed that I didn't. She responded by saying even a child knows how to shop online using a smartphone. I suggested she could ask a child to help her with the orders.Immediately, she bid me farewell, claiming that chatting with me was a waste of her time and even telling me to "go die." Fortunately, I had read stories about similar scams and recognized her seemingly sincere intentions to date me were merely a trap.Guys, please exercise caution when receiving friend requests from unknown pretty girls on Facebook, especially if they quickly suggest moving the conversation to WhatsApp because they seldom use Facebook. This is a red flag. It's best to delete their account and block them, as there could be someone impersonating them behind the scenes with the intention to scam you. Stay vigilant and protect yourself online.
He asked if i remember who he is. That we were close friends and he had not contacted me for some time. He keep trying to get me to guess a name, and i replied asking if he is the one whom I kept borrowing money from. He said give him a moment and disconnected the call.
A few days ago, I received a call from an unknown individual who refused to identify himself. Assuming it was a friend who had changed their number, I played along and asked the caller to reveal their identity. To my surprise, the person on the other end asked me to guess who they were. Believing it to be a harmless prank, I continued the conversation without suspicion.The following day, the same caller reached out to me once again, this time requesting urgent assistance. They claimed to be unable to transfer money to their contractor and asked me to help them out. Trusting that this person was indeed my friend, I agreed to transfer the requested amount, as they promised to reimburse me within 12 hours.However, the next day arrived, and not only did the caller fail to respond to my messages, but all attempts to reach them by phone proved unsuccessful. It was at this moment that I realized I had fallen victim to a scam.

We chatted online for a while after connecting through a dating site (meetme), after a few days, she asked me to "help" her with her side job for MYTHERESA website, which i refused (i smell something fishy with the request). Even if i refused she was insisting that it's totally safe and there's nothing to be afraid of, which further raises my suspicions. All communications stopped after my refusal!
I recently encountered an individual named Ivan Koh Wei M??? (alleged DOB: 28/7/1991) on the dating app CMB. He claimed to be working as a business manager at Credit Suisse for the past five years and holds PR status in Singapore. Ivan stated that he owned a resale condo in River Valley and a car, with his hometown being Kuala Lumpur. Ivan persuaded me to continue our conversation on Telegram, where he employed charming and sweet messages to gain my trust. Despite my initial inactivity on Telegram, he made consistent efforts to engage me, sharing photos of his daily life, family, work, and even indulging in suggestive conversations. He acted extremely eager to become my boyfriend and expressed a strong desire to introduce me to his family in Kuala Lumpur. In fact, he went to the extent of sending me an unsolicited explicit photo, which I firmly reprimanded him for. His communication skills were impeccable, demonstrating a deep understanding of how to manipulate and counter psychological defenses. His story appeared flawless, leaving no room for doubt. Upon my return from overseas, Ivan informed me of a business trip to Taiwan, where he claimed that a non-disclosure agreement prevented him from taking photos or videos. During this time, he started calling me nightly to check in on me. He requested a favor, asking me to assist with a site reconnaissance for a BTO project called Bishan Ridges, as part of a private crowdfunding initiative he was involved in. Considering my proximity to the location, I agreed to help. As a gesture of gratitude, Ivan sent me a picture claiming to have bought me a Tiffany &amp; Co necklace from Taiwan. Shortly after, he shared the news that his boss was pleased with our relationship and had secured me a spot on a private crowdfunding website operated by Guoco Land: https://www.guocopvtpsg23.com. He guided me through the account setup process and provided instructions on how to view investments and projects. Initially hesitant, I eventually succumbed to emotional blackmail when Ivan exploited my vulnerabilities and cast doubts on government projects, pressuring me to transfer an initial amount of $500. However, after taking some time to cool down and think logically, I decided to investigate further. To my relief, I discovered reports of similar investment scams matching the scheme Ivan had presented to me. Realizing I had been deceived, I played along, feigning interest in investing more. Fortunately, I managed to retrieve my initial deposit and the supposed "profits." Unfortunately, my personal details, including my name, NRIC, and bank account information, had already been entered into the fraudulent account. Please exercise caution if you come across someone using the WhatsApp number +6588109451 and claiming to be Ivan Koh Wei Ming. Furthermore, the photos he has been using are associated with an Instagram account under the name Chris Nge (IG: chris.nge). Stay vigilant and be wary of online scams.
Yesterday, I received a call from someone named "Steven" speaking in Mandarin. He claimed to have lost his phone and provided me with a new number. Since I was busy with a meeting, I didn't have much time to verify his identity. However, today he called again and asked for my assistance with some UOB card transactions. I informed him that I don't have a UOB card and he then asked if I have a DBS card that I rarely use. I became suspicious and questioned him about which Steven he was and why he was speaking in Malaysian Mandarin. I decided to end the call and block his number, which was +65 9098 5440. Please be cautious as this person could be using different names such as John or Peter. It's important to stay vigilant and protect yourself from potential scams.
I was using the dating app Tantan and came across a girl named Jasmine. She requested to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. Initially, our conversations seemed normal, but on the third day, she asked for my help with her second part-time job. I had some suspicions and even checked scam alerts, but against my better judgment, I still decided to help her. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a mistake. This experience has taught me a valuable lesson: to trust my gut instincts and not to trust someone I meet online. It's important to be cautious and rely on reputable sources such as scam alerts to protect oneself from potential scams.
On June 19th, I received a call from an unidentified caller informing me about a new store opening and inviting me to attend the opening on Sunday. The call came from the number 8554 3698. Then, on June 20th, I received another call stating that there was an issue with the shipment and the money could not be released to the supplier. They requested a PayNow transfer to be made to the supplier. The request was made through a WhatsApp message from the number 8581 1390. The message included the following details: "PayNow: 8642 ???? Name: ANDREW Amount: 3700 Please exercise caution and be wary of making any payments or sharing personal information without verifying the legitimacy of the situation and the parties involved.
I first contacted her through Tinder, and we matched very quickly. She willingly gave me her local number, which prompted me to contact her on WhatsApp for faster communication. Over the next few weeks, she consistently replied to my messages promptly and often asked what I was doing. Our conversations eventually led to me asking her out for a meal, but she declined on multiple occasions. Throughout our conversations, she frequently talked about how she was making extra money through online orders. Gradually, she started asking me to help her with these orders because they were becoming overwhelming. Here's the modus operandi: I would be tasked with sending a WhatsApp message to an automated WhatsApp bot at +6581948912 to receive an "order." The bot would provide a link to an item on Louis Vuitton's (LV) online store and ask me to take a screenshot as verification. Next, the bot would provide the details of a "recipient" account where I was supposed to make a bank transfer or use PayNow to an account that seemed suspicious. I was explicitly told to avoid using GIRO. The transfer amount would be the cost of the item on the LV link. I would then be promised reimbursement of the full amount, plus a 5-10% commission. I immediately stopped at the point of transferring the money, and now I'm reporting this as a genuine form of scam. The "lady" insisted she was from Deloitte and argued, "Why would LV cheat me of such a small amount?" when I questioned her.
The caller then requested a loan of $3,700, which I declined. They assured me that they could repay the amount by 3 pm as they needed to urgently pay a supplier. Subsequently, they asked for a smaller loan amount that I could afford. I used PayNow to transfer $1,000 to the number (9094 9035) under the name "Iris Voon Su Ting." Later, the caller came up with another reason to request more money, and I could only afford to lend an additional $700. By 3 pm, I became anxious that it might be a scam and decided to call the number, but the line was engaged. It was only after discussing the situation with a colleague that I realized my friend had not actually lost their phone. I then understood that it was an impersonation scam, as the caller knew my name from my WhatsApp profile. In total, S$1,700 was transferred via PayNow. I have since contacted OCBC and DBS to report the issue, and I filed a police report on the same day.

I met a guy on Tinder by the name Kenny who claimed to be working in his uncle's company in Singapore. Almost like another story on this site (where he is known as Matt), he claimed to be a 33-year-old Hong Konger who has been living in SG for 3 years. While chatting on telegram, he would start 'love bombing’ me, being extremely sweet and flirty. Shortly after transferring to telegram, he conveniently needed to go back to Hong Kong to ‘settle some paperwork’. I would ask when he would be back, and each time something new will come up in Hong Kong that would require him to stay for an indefinite time. I asked him for his Instagram. He followed me with what looked like a throwaway account, with the name 'Matt'. The Instagram account was completely bare, without a display picture, and looked very similar to those bot accounts that would try to slip into your DMs. He eventually talked to me about MaxMagicExchange, explaining that he just made a sum of money and told me there would be no cost to me trying. The platform traded USDt/BTC and required a top-up of at least 100USDt, which he transferred to me easily. We made a 'successful trade’, and he taught me how to withdraw the cash. It was remitted within the hour. Following which, he would only talk to me about trading when he messaged, asking me to top up more (SGD400) so that the profit margins would be higher. I did so because I felt bad that he transferred USDt to me the first time. Then one night, he messaged me saying he'd transferred 3,000usdt into my account, and I only needed to top up 1,400usdt to trade on a 12hr option. I declined, and he eventually told me he 'borrowed money from his friends' to meet the balance. I checked, and confirmed the balance was 5,000USDt. We did the trade the next day and he contacted me again 3 hours later to tell me that the market was 'volatile', so I had to contact 'customer service' (CS), who told me I needed to top up 10,000usdt for a 'risk reserve'. I told him I didn't have the money, and he tried to negotiate with me, saying he would try to help me. Eventually, he was able to make up the numbers for the 10,000USDt. The trade was successful, and I tried withdrawing the cash, except this time I would have to pay taxes on the earnings, and to pay the taxes first before the money would be released. I asked CS for an SG bank account number, and they gave me a personal bank account, inclusive of a Paynow number. I immediately called the number and as expected, the line was out of service. Push comes to shove, and I end up blocking him without returning his 'money'. I doubt I would have been able to return it anyway.
On June 17th, I received an Instagram ad in Mandarin language recruiting for a flower shop marketing assistant. The ad mentioned a pay rate of $75 per day and $2,800 per month for assisting with online order submissions and improving brand recognition.Upon clicking the ad, I was directed to a conversation on WhatsApp where I was asked for personal information. The WhatsApp contact provided was +65 8173 9349, and the person identified as Yuki Yup was the point of contact. Yuki explained that HOME Pro, a company that handles client orders in the online system, had a flower shop as one of their clients. They shared their registered company, HOME PRO PTE LTD, on Companies SG as a means to "verify" their legitimacy.Yuki explained the workflow, which involved me submitting orders through their system. They offered to provide a tutorial for registering a working account in their system. They stated that once the order was submitted before 9:30 PM, a daily salary of $80 would be transferred via PayNow upon completion of the job. They claimed that the tasks could be completed within 1-2 hours and that the working days and times were flexible.After conducting further checks and clarifying details with Yuki, she provided a website, but it was only accessible on mobile devices and not on desktop.Yuki requested that I share the invitation code for registering the account once I successfully registered. However, due to various suspicious factors such as the high salary for low working hours, unclear job description, and the unofficial landing page for account registration, I believed it to be a scam. I deleted the personal information I had shared with Yuki on WhatsApp and decided not to proceed with setting up an account on the website she provided.After not replying for about an hour, Yuki sent me a voice message from another business WhatsApp phone number, +65 8472 9464.Throughout the conversation, I did not share any bank account or detailed location information.
Received a call (recorded message) claiming to be "ICA". I hung up immediately, knowing that it was a scam.
I connected with someone named Jeremiel on Bumble. He claimed to be a Malaysian working in the IT industry in Singapore for over 10 years. Our communication quickly shifted to Telegram, but I expressed concerns about scams on that platform. Despite my reservations, he insisted we move to WhatsApp. I shared my WhatsApp number, and we connected there.The next day, he called me and we had a lengthy conversation over the phone. Without fail, he would call me every day, sharing his so-called "daily life" pictures and talking sweetly to gain my trust. He exploited my vulnerabilities and weaknesses.After a week, he informed me that he had to go on a business trip to Indonesia and that his phone's camera would be disabled by the overseas company for two weeks. He repeatedly mentioned his best friend, Andrew Chew, who he claimed was the CFO of Guccoland. He stated that he begged Andrew for something called private placement, which involved loaning money to the government for BTO (Built-to-Order) projects. Supposedly, the government would provide up to 20% interest in return.Fortunately, I did not lose any money to this scam. However, I did share my personal information by providing daily life pictures and my address. I eventually blocked him, but I am now concerned about what they might do with my personal information. I am feeling scared and uncertain about the situation.
I met a woman on a dating app, and we primarily communicated through Google Chat. She claimed to be a journalist and quickly expressed her love for me. She mentioned wanting to buy a house in Singapore and asked for my help in finding a condominium. One day, she informed me that she had to travel to Malaysia for a criminal case investigation. She later claimed to have been injured by gangs and unable to access her bank account. She requested a loan of $1,300 (in USD, not SGD).To buy time, I pretended to be unaware of how to transfer money to Malaysia, explaining that I only had a Singaporean bank account. She then promised to consult with a doctor and provide me with a Singaporean bank account. To test her authenticity, I requested her ID before sending any money. She presented a poorly Photoshopped fake ID, but as a graphic designer, I easily recognized its falseness.Fortunately, I did not lose any money to her, but I did have some of my initial photos shared with her. I am sharing my experience here to raise awareness and caution others. You can check the person's photo on some websites o verify their identity. It is essential for everyone to be cautious and vigilant when interacting with others online.
I was contacted by the company through their ambassadors and given access to a Telegram group. In this group, members, possibly fake bots, claimed to be satisfied with the company and mentioned making passive income through Bitcoin mining. The group admin then provided me with a link to register on their website: https://emperise-investment.???/. The registration process only required me to enter my name, email address, and my BTC address.Once I made a deposit, ranging from $50 to $500, they asked for an additional $500 to qualify for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. This request was made after I had already made the deposit, and not at the beginning. I have now decided to refuse and withdraw my deposit. However, without completing the KYC process, I am unable to make any withdrawals, leaving my money blocked or, in other words, nonexistent.Furthermore, the Telegram group (which I suspect consists of bots) started sending screenshots of their withdrawals, including BTC addresses, etc. When I checked these addresses on blockchain.com, they didn't even exist.
He was aware of my name and claimed to have lost his mobile phone. He requested me to add a particular mobile number without revealing whose number it was. When I called him back and inquired about the identity, he responded that I should figure out who would speak to me in such a manner. He then asked if I was busy and mentioned that he would call me back at a later time.
I received an SMS informing me that my Sintel reward point balance is 5340, and it expires today. It was important to claim my reward. The text message included a web address, singtie.club. Curious, I clicked on it, which took me to the Singtel page offering an exchange of my points for an Apple Watch for S$1. I proceeded with the transaction, providing my card details, including the name on the card, card number, expiry date, and security number on the back. However, the next day, I couldn't find any record of the transaction, leading me to believe it was a scam. Today, June 15, at around 4:45 pm, I reported the incident to my bank, DBS. As of now, I haven't noticed any missing money from my account. DBS has canceled both my bank cards and my online access to the bank account. They advised me to report this to the Singapore Police.
https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-12Jun2023142414PM The caller claimed to be someone who had changed their phone number, today I checked this website and found that it's the same mobile number that called me.
My mom came across an advertisement on Facebook selling corn, so she clicked on it and started communicating with the seller through WhatsApp. The seller instructed her to transfer $5 to the provided bank account, POSB 06170015??. The user also convinced her to download a file called "grab n go v2.apk" [Editor's note: Malicious app] and enter her address for delivery. Later that day, around 21:30, she received a call from the bank requesting verification for some transactions. To her surprise, there were three transactions totaling approximately $10,000 and a cash advance loan of $4,000 made from her bank account. When she tried to log in to internet banking, she was unable to do so and was informed that her login details had been changed. She received a message from SingPass stating that her profile had been updated. When she logged in to her SingPass account, she discovered that her personal contact number had been changed to 85804771 and her email to xiguaqiang21@gmail.com. These changes were not made by her, and she had not shared her bank account details or SingPass account with anyone. The total amount of money lost was $50,000.
Beware of online jobs that offer excessively high pay. Lately, there have been job notifications for Program Executives/Marketing Executives that come with vague job descriptions, unverified websites, a small number of followers, and low review counts. The "HR" contacts you for a phone interview, which initially appears legitimate. However, they subsequently request that you fill out a survey for interview purposes. This survey includes personal information such as your home address, NRIC, and date of birth. Fortunately, I quickly realized that job interviews do not require personal information according to the Employment Act enforced by the Personal Data Protection Commission. Providing such details in this context poses a probable risk of falling into a scam. Remember, if something seems suspicious, it's best not to take any chances. Always verify the original websites and their job postings and apply through trusted sources.
I received a call from an unknown number, 84470762. In Mandarin, he called me by my correct name, indicating that my name has been accurately linked to my mobile number in his contact list. He informed me that he had changed his telephone number and called to notify me. I asked him for his name, to which he responded, "How could I have been forgotten? How could you not recognize my voice?" He then asked me to guess his identity. Unable to identify his voice, I eventually decided to hang up and block the number. The entire phone call lasted 40 seconds.
A caller named Jason claimed to be a long-lost friend when he contacted me on my mobile phone. He asked if I recognized him, to which I initially replied no. However, after questioning him a few times, he finally mentioned his name as Jason. He then informed me that he had recently lost his phone and had filed a police report. Just a few days ago, he acquired a new phone. Additionally, he mentioned that he had just opened a cafe. He asked if I was available to meet him at his cafe, but I responded uncertainly. He said he would contact me again once he had resolved the police case and intended to invite friends for a gathering at his cafe. Please note that the phone number provided may contain a typo as I have deleted the actual number after reporting it to ScamShield.

I received a phone call from someone claiming to be my friend. When I asked who he was, he played a guessing game and didn't reveal his identity. After several attempts, he finally identified himself as Joe Lin and asked me to save his new number as he had lost his phone recently. The next day, he called again and requested my help in transferring $500 to his supplier. However, I declined his request.
I received an unsolicited message on Telegram from someone named Gemini Admin (@gemini_adm88), offering a part-time job. They asked me to write fake Google reviews about various places in Singapore, such as cafes, hawkers, and restaurants, and promised payment for my efforts. Initially, I received small sums of money, like $5 or $10, as compensation. After one day, the admin tried to persuade me to undertake an "advanced task." This involved depositing an initial amount and clicking a few buttons to withdraw a larger sum. In my first attempt, I deposited $200 and successfully withdrew $240. Encouraged by this, the admin pushed me to undertake more advanced tasks. In the second and final task, the admin involved me in a group with two other users, who I suspect were paid actors. Failure to complete the deposit tasks would result in penalties. The tasks included depositing $800, followed by $3888, and finally $13888 into what I believe were randomly selected money mule accounts. Exploiting my greed and naivety, I complied and deposited the $800 and $3888. However, before depositing the final $13888, I suddenly became suspicious and anxious. I deposited only $3000 of the requested amount before realizing my mistake. I immediately alerted my bank and the police. The bad news is that I lost nearly $8000, which was a significant sum for me. However, the good news is that I managed to stop myself before falling for the $13888 scam.
Caller called and mentioned my name and said that they have changed their number. When I ask who is it, he mentioned one of my friends name. I was working when the person call during lunch time As I was busy I did not wait for the person to explain the reason for the call and said I was busy and said I will call later. I called my friend later and my friend said he did not contact me at all.
The caller claimed to be someone who had changed their phone number, and their voice sounded identical to the person they claimed to be. They called again, this time asking for assistance in updating the POSB app with their new phone number. Later on, they called once more, stating that the update would take 24 hours to activate. They then asked for my help in making an urgent PayNow transaction of a few hundred dollars, promising to return the money tomorrow. Naturally, I declined and informed them that I couldn't assist.
I want to share my recent experience with a romance scam. I met a girl named Alice on the Tan Tan dating app. She insisted on moving our communication to WhatsApp, claiming it would help us avoid detection by the system.As our relationship progressed, Alice would frequently mention being on her period and experiencing severe pain. She would also mention working late nights for mytheresa, an online retailer, in order to make ends meet. She would complain about the pain while still having to stay up until 2am to complete tasks for mytheresa.Eventually, Alice pleaded with me to help fulfill purchases for mytheresa.sg through WhatsApp. They claimed it would assist in boosting sales. They provided a fake mytheresa WhatsApp contact and initially asked me to purchase a low-cost item, promising a 5% commission as reimbursement.However, the trap became apparent when they started sending me higher-priced items to purchase without any intention of reimbursing me. They would keep pushing me to make more purchases, draining my savings until I realized it was a scam. Even the mytheresa.sg WhatsApp account they provided was an impersonation.I deeply regret not listening to my gut instinct, and I hope this warning prevents others from falling for the same scam.
I received a call from a 1800 number, but upon answering, it turned out to be a pre-recorded message claiming to be from the DBS service center. The message stated that there was a transaction of over $3,000 on a bank card, mentioning the last four digits. It instructed me to press 1 to approve the transaction or 2 to speak to an operator. However, I immediately hung up as I suspected it to be a scam call.

I would like to share my experience. I received a direct video call from +92 3267239158, and the scammer's background was filled with Ministry of Manpower posters. He was wearing a cap with the MOM logo.He introduced himself as Wang from "MOM" and started telling a story about my current bank card having a problem.Immediately, I asked him to show his ID card closer so that I could take a screenshot, but the scammer's colleague disconnected the call.I am sharing my story to create awareness among the public so that they do not fall prey to these scammers.
Scammer: Hello, Vincent? (He knows my name.) Me: Yes? Who are you? Scammer: Oh, dear, you don't know who I am? Me: No! Scammer: Your old friend here. I called you a few days ago. You don't recognize my voice? Me: No, I really can't recognize your voice. Who are you? Scammer: Oh, how come? Me: Who are you? ********. scammer hung up the phone **********
I received a WhatsApp video call from this phone number: +65 9082 3072. The person appeared to be dressed as a Singapore Police Force officer, wearing a uniform and a police cap. He claimed to be a Singapore police officer. I immediately ended the call as I did not believe he was a genuine Singapore police officer. Please investigate this phone number..
Yesterday, I received a call from a person named Lena, who claimed to be from Exponential Growth Pte Ltd, stating that she had found my resume on the jobsdb website. Since I had not used jobsdb before, I questioned how she obtained my details. Lena explained that job sites are interoperable, which supposedly allowed her access to my information. She then offered me a work-from-home opportunity, promising to provide six days of work per week. The job entailed completing partner orders and assisting in improving hotel occupancy rates. According to Lena, the working hours were from 10 AM to 6 PM, and each completed order would earn me a 2% commission. I decided to give it a try and completed an hour of work yesterday and today, receiving a small payment. However, I became suspicious of the situation and consulted with my mother. To our surprise, during our research, we discovered a similar scam tactic on hardwarezone, where an individual was scammed by the same company. The victim was even asked to deposit money to supposedly earn more. In order to raise awareness and prevent others from falling victim to this scam, I would like to share my experience. Fortunately, I did not fall for the scam, and the scammers only had access to my name and phone number in order to send me payment via PayNow.
I received a call from an unknown male individual who addressed me by name, saying, "Hi Amos, long time no see. Do you remember who I am?" To test his authenticity, I asked him, "Do you remember the $500 you borrowed from me last year?" As soon as I posed this question, he abruptly ended the call by hanging up.
On Saturday, I received a call from someone who claimed to be a close Malaysian friend of mine. The voice on the other end sounded exactly like my friend, which made me believe it was her. The person asked me to save her new number, and when I inquired about her name, she confirmed that she was the same person I always addressed by her English name, Iris. On Monday morning, this person called me on WhatsApp and requested my assistance in updating her new contact information on the POSB app. After guiding her through the process, she informed me that she had an urgent payment to make to her contractor. She explained that due to the recent update of her contact number, the bank had imposed a 12-hour restriction on her payments. Desperate for help, she asked me to lend her $3800 and provided me with the contractor's number: 83437736. She claimed that the contractor's name was Mohamed Harith Rusyaidi bin Mohamed Rafiee and assured me that she would repay the money by the end of the day. However, I became suspicious and decided to verify the situation. I called my friend's original number, which remained unchanged, and confirmed that she hadn't made any such requests. Realizing that I was being targeted by a scammer, I informed the imposter that I couldn't provide the funds. Despite my refusal, the scammer persisted in calling me. I explained that I was unable to answer the phone due to work commitments and advised her to communicate directly with her supposed contractor. After that, she ceased all contact with me.
I saw this Facebook ad that sells grocery vouchers like NUTC, Sheng Siong, Giant etc. It's obviously fake. I didn't buy it. The name of Facebook page is Voucher Explorer. Link: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100093355657702 Please do not give money to this fake page.Editor's Note: If you have come across any dubious adverts, please report the post to the platform that you come across the ads. You can also help to warn others by sharing it with your loved ones and friends.
I received a call from a man who claimed he had changed his phone and asked me to record his new number. I questioned his identity, and he responded by saying I couldn't recognize his voice. Since he sounded like one of my business contacts, I mentioned the guy's name (Ian), and he acknowledged it. After the call, I decided to call Ian's old number to verify and confirmed that it wasn't him who had called. To gather more evidence, I pretended to text the scammer on WhatsApp about work matters. He couldn't reply until the next day, stating that he would update me. A few hours later, the scammer, speaking with a Malaysian accent, called me and claimed to be having problems with his bank's OTP (One-Time Password) and asked how to change it on his mobile phone. I asked for his identity again, and he insisted he was Ian. He wanted to know if he could change the bank OTP to send it to my mobile number. I acted confused and told him I didn't understand what he meant. He then mentioned sending me a POSB bank transaction screenshot via WhatsApp. At that point, I blocked the number, downloaded the ScamShield app, and reported the incident on this website to share it with the rest.
I met Joshua Tan (Chen Yi Da, DOB: 28/10/1990) on CMB app this year. We then moved the conversation to WhatsApp, and he sent me a video deleting the dating apps to prove he was looking for a serious relationship and urged me to do the same. Joshua is a cybersecurity professional who shared daily photos of food and activities, despite my request for him not to. One day, he mentioned a work trip to Indonesia to resolve a client's database issue. We continued chatting for 2-3 weeks, during which he mentioned Guocoland/Guoco Group/Hong Leong Group. Despite never meeting in person, I trusted Joshua due to our daily phone calls and his positive words, thoughts, and attitude. I fell into this trap. Being overseas, Joshua asked for help checking the BTO status in Singapore to decide whether to invest in private crowdfunding or not. He emphasized the need for secrecy, as revealing the investment could cost him his job. Out of goodwill, I went to the BTO site near my area. Later, Joshua claimed to have successfully invested in the BTO and said he owed me a big favor. I declined, but he insisted it was difficult to join the "investment platform" and used his favor to get me an account, urging me to cherish the opportunity. He then started explaining the investment procedures. The process began with an initial investment of $500, which yielded a $60 return in 2 hours. After three "small investments," he advised me to top up funds to upgrade to a "silver member" and become a permanent member of the platform. I rejected this idea, feeling uneasy about how easy the money seemed to be earned. However, Joshua continued to persuade me, claiming it was a big chance for our better future. Once again, I trusted him, and when I didn't have enough money, he topped up my investment. In the end, I had invested a total of $82,000 of my hard-earned money. When I attempted to make withdrawals, my account was frozen due to allegedly inputting the wrong password. To unfreeze it, I was required to pay $40,000 as a security fund within 48 hours. When I questioned Joshua about this, he deflected blame onto me for not informing him about the incorrect passwords, stating it was my problem, not the platform's. (I had entered the wrong password three times in a row, but was it really wrong all three times?) Feeling deceived, I realized it was a scam. Joshua claimed he would try to raise $40,000 for me but also suggested I seek loans from banks, private lenders, or friends. He added, "If you don't want to settle, then it's okay. I'll try to help you." After two months, I came across an article about Joshua. If only I had seen it two months earlier, none of this would have happened. Thus, I decided to share my experience to warn everyone. Until now, I haven't been able to let go of this ordeal. I feel compelled to keep this secret until I die. To everyone, please remain cautious and don't let your guard down for anyone.
I received a call from a man with a Malaysian accent who resembled one of my acquaintances. He claimed to have lost his phone and provided me with a new number. He repeatedly asked if I remembered him but refused to disclose his name. After a few days, he contacted me again, requesting a $2300 transfer. This raised suspicions, prompting me to call the old number and confirm that the person was indeed a scammer. I promptly blocked the number and reported the incident. It's worth noting that the phone number displayed on my device didn't have a "+65" prefix, initially giving the impression of a genuine call. Additionally, the scammer followed a different approach by contacting me over a period of a few days instead of attempting to trick me.
I have received the scam call twice. The first time, a man with a Malaysian accent claimed that he had lost his previous number and asked me to record his current number. I inquired about his identity, and he responded by suggesting that I couldn't recognize his voice. I mentioned a guy's name, and he acknowledged it. After the call, I asked a colleague to call Alvin and verify, and he confirmed that it wasn't him who had called. I promptly blocked the number and contacted the scam center to report the incident. Yesterday, I received another call from someone claiming that their number was lost and requesting me to save it. I questioned the person's identity three times, but they abruptly ended the call. Shortly after, they contacted me via WhatsApp and mentioned that I had just received a scam call. They wanted to provide me with a weblink to download an anti-scam app. I assured the individual that I had already made a police report and downloaded the app a long time ago, so there was no need to worry about it.
I received a WhatsApp message from someone claiming to conduct a marketing survey on behalf of Singsale. They asked numerous questions and promised a $10 voucher as a reward for completing the survey. However, this is a prevalent phishing scam aimed at gathering personal information. Eventually, they will send a "link" for you to claim the voucher. Please be cautious and avoid falling victim to such scams.
I received a call from an unknown local number that was not +65. The caller, a young Malaysian lady, repeatedly claimed to be my friend and asked me to guess her name. Eventually, I mentioned the name of one of my friends, Chris, as her voice resembled his. She confirmed it was correct and proceeded to tell me that she had lost her phone and wallet at a nearby hawker store. She asked me to save her new number for future contact. The next morning, she urgently called me again and asked for assistance in transferring $800 to her because she couldn't do a bank transfer to her friend without her phone. She said that the one-time password would only be sent to her personal phone. I became suspicious when she changed her request to $300 after I mentioned that I didn't have enough money at the moment. It became clear that this was a scam when she asked me to transfer the money to a stranger's bank account, not under her caller name. I wanted to share my story and raise awareness among the public about this scam tactic. It's important not to trust random calls from strangers and avoid providing personal information to them.

We received a call from someone who sounded Malaysian, and we initially thought it was our regular hair stylist. He claimed to have lost his phone and wallet at a nearby hawker store and asked us to save his new number. The next day, he urgently requested assistance to transfer a certain amount to his supplier, explaining that his internet banking would only be activated later due to the previous day's phone loss. He assured us that he would transfer the money back once his account was activated and asked us to meet him at the salon at 4 pm that day. He provided us with the phone number of the payee and called us a second time, urgently seeking assistance. Unfortunately, instead of directly verifying with the hair salon, we transferred the requested amount via PayNow to the indicated payee. We only realized it was a scam when we tried to contact the number later and found that it was no longer in use.
I received a video call from the above number. He is wearing a mask, and the background shows 'Ministry of Manpower' logo on the wall. He is wearing a mask, making it impossible to see his face. He is also wearing a Ministry of Manpower cap. He tells me that my bank account has been blocked and asks me to show him my ID so he can fix it. I know it is a scam call. I am posting here because this is the first video call scam, and I want to help fellow friends in Singapore. Please be aware and cautious. Some basic checks to consider: The number is not from Singapore; it starts with +92.
I met a guy named Matt on Bumble in Singapore. He claimed to be a 34-year-old Taiwanese working in Singapore and looking for a partner to settle down with. After two days of chatting, we moved our conversations to Telegram. Like other victims who have experienced similar situations, he quickly professed his love and shared personal details about his family and social life. Initially, I didn't think much of his behavior, although it seemed suspicious. I believed he was just overly romantic and honest. I also trusted the dating app since his profile was verified, but I now realize I was too quick to judge. He lured me into using MaxMagicExchange, explaining option trading and passionately sharing his supposed profits over the past two years. To gain my trust, he willingly transferred 400 USDT (around SGD 500+) to me, claiming it was easy to earn significant returns with his guidance. Days later, he insisted that I recharge another 500 USDT into my account. However, I informed him that I didn't have enough money, which made him furious. Eventually, he allowed me to trade with whatever I had in my crypto wallet temporarily. Now that I know he's a fraud engaging in malicious activities, talking to him feels like talking to a ghost. I discovered that he is also using another dating app for gay couples, using one of his photos that I had saved but under a completely new identity named Martin Chan, a 26-year-old from Singapore. Right now, my focus is spreading awareness about this scam.
I received a WhatsApp message from a person named Rose (+1 (843) 430-3952) claiming to be from Shopee. The message stated: "Hi there! I am Rose from Shopee's promotional team. We have a new promotional offer on Shopee! Rate Shopee and get $15 SGD on your PAYNOW. You can earn an additional $15 SGD if you join our activity group, where you can earn $30 SGD or more! How would you rate Shopee? A) Excellent B) Very good C) Good D) Bad E) Very bad" Having read news about fake Shopee survey and job scams before, I recognized this as a scam. I would like to remind everyone not to fall for such scams.
I was contacted by a random person on WhatsApp who invited me to participate in an online app rating service that promised 1% to 4% commission. The catch was that I had to deposit a certain amount of money. Initially, I received my money back along with some additional profits. However, on the third occasion, the required payment escalated to 30k. I managed to obtain bank loans and paid the amount, but then it increased to 63k. This is when I became suspicious. They informed me that I could only withdraw money after completing 38 ratings. They lured me in by initially providing profits, but it was all a trap. The company involved was called Novatise. They added me to a WhatsApp group with other members pretending to be agents who were making substantial profits. I learned the hard way that there is no such thing as easy money. In total, I lost about 34k, which was all of my life savings.
Contacted via WhatsApp for a Shopee survey. They will first verify your number, and regardless of your response, they will send you the questions. Text used by the scammer: "Sorry to bother you. This is Chloe Mark from Shopee's Marketing Department.

Yesterday, I received a call and promptly returned it. The person greeted me by name, asserting they were a longtime friend who had acquired a new number and urged me to save it. Curious, I inquired about their identity. In a Malaysian accent, they responded, "Don't you remember me? I'm Ah Ching. We used to work together..." I replied negatively. Shortly after, they messaged me on WhatsApp, providing their new number. This morning, they called again, claiming difficulty in changing their iBanking details due to a lost phone and the inability to activate their new number. They asked if I knew how to assist them. Recognizing that I didn't know anyone named Ah Ching and considering their fabricated stories of shared lunches, which never occurred, I concluded that they were a scammer. Consequently, I promptly blocked their contact. Additionally, the absence of any colleagues by that name further solidified my belief.
My family and I were searching for a new house to rent, and I came across a posting on Carousel. Without hesitation, I reached out to the person via WhatsApp to express interest, and he promptly called me. Since the current unit was still occupied and the tenant didn't want to be disturbed for another week, he sent me a video of the unit instead. To secure the place, he offered to reserve it with a security deposit equivalent to one month's rent, as well as one month's advance payment. He provided me with all the necessary documents, including the tenancy agreement, proof of ownership, and his agent license. He also shared an account number for me to transfer the initial down payment. I transferred $3100 as the initial deposit, intending to pay the rest when we moved in. However, the following day, he became uncontactable and refused to answer my calls. Worried, I personally checked the unit mentioned in the tenancy agreement he had provided, only to find that the person residing there had no knowledge of any rental agreement. Immediately realising the seriousness of the situation, I filed a police report.
A person with the online moniker "Ng Yu Han" initially contacted me through Facebook and expressed interest in being friends. Afterward, they added me on WhatsApp. Within two days of chatting, they shared how much they could confide in me and expressed a desire to be in a relationship with me. They mentioned feeling unwell and requested my assistance in fulfilling some orders for their part-time job. This "part-time job" involved placing orders for Louis Vuitton products as part of a sales campaign. They claimed that a third-party merchant would reimburse me the principal amount plus a commission for any orders placed, with no physical delivery of the products. Although I voiced my suspicions about the scheme, they assured me that this was a common practice in e-commerce to artificially boost their sales figures. Subsequently, a "Louis Vuitton Customer Service" WhatsApp account approached me to place an order on behalf of the person. The first task involved clicking on a product link and sending a payment of $95 to a PayNow number. Knowing that this was clearly a scam due to multiple red flags (such as the unrealistically high commission, a multinational company resorting to inappropriate means, and payment to a Singaporean PayNow account for a luxury brand), tactics I had read about frequently on Straitstimes/Mothership, I anticipated that the scammer would increase the value of the tasks and commissions in an attempt to exploit my greed, starting with the $10 commission as a hook. Deciding to play along with the scammer, I used my phone to alter an image of a previous PayNow transaction record and sent it to the scammer (please note that I never sent any actual payment). The scammer acknowledged my "payment" and sent over the rebate and commission. However, they later realized their mistake after verifying the details. At that point, the tone of the person claiming to be my lover, "Ng Yu Han," abruptly changed and they requested that I stop talking to them and not contact them again.Editor's Note: We would like to advise users not to engage with scammers but instead report and block them on the platform that they are using to communicate with the scammers.
My mom came across a Singbrother Travel advertisement and privately messaged the business on Facebook on May 30th. She provided her WhatsApp details, and the scammer contacted her on the same day. The scammer asked for the phone model she was using and provided her with a link to download an app. They also provided instructions on adjusting her phone settings to enable the app. On May 31st, at 9 am, my mom realised that her POSB bank account was empty. The scammer had transferred over $17,000 to another POSB account on May 30th.
I want to share that these potential scam phone numbers to prevent others from falling prey to it. The phone numbers involved are +6581779394 (Wendy) and +84343160751 (Freda). The company they claimed to be from is 'Fact Set'. The scam requires individuals to receive payment through online banking, and the job promises a payment of 50 to 200 SGD for 1 to 2 hours of work involving app optimization.
This person called me and addressed me by my name, asking me to guess who he is and if I remember him. It is clear from his accent that he is Malaysian. I responded that I don't remember him and inquired about his identity. He claimed to be "David". As I have no friends by that name, I am pretty sure that he's a scammer.
I received a friend request notification on Instagram from someone named "Shirley Tan." She claimed to be from KL and working in Clementi. We moved our conversation to WhatsApp, where she mentioned working in Clementi and doing part-time sales jobs for Courts after work. On a day when I was feeling emotionally down due to relationship issues, we had been chatting when suddenly she asked me to help her with a Courts order on her behalf. I started feeling suspicious about the Courts customer service merchant when she sent a WhatsApp message to them. It's worth noting that for the first transaction, she said she would handle it, but for the second one, she pressured me to take care of it. Luckily, I stayed alert. Please remember not to trust unknown individuals on social networks too easily. Stay aware and cautious! Instagram: @Shirley_9521
I met a guy on the CMB dating app who calls himself Seng. We connected towards the end of May 2023. After chatting for an hour, he asked for my WhatsApp number because we had common interests. We started chatting on WhatsApp, and from the second day onwards, he would text me every day about his whereabouts. He greeted me good morning and called me every night. He was upfront about wanting to settle down and saw a future with me. He mentioned that he works as a game designer in the SEA Group and holds a high position, managing over 50 staff in his team. He mentioned being transferred from Malaysia to the Singapore branch and said that his direct boss, the Chief Product Officer of SEA Group, is David Chen. He also mentioned that he lives in a condo at 3 Orchard By The Park, which he bought for 3 million, and drives a car, giving the impression of significant wealth. He started telling me about a private equity project on a BTO crowdfunding platform, explaining that David gave him the chance to work on it. He wanted to meet me near my office since he had a meeting nearby. I agreed, but ten minutes later, he told me that the client wanted him to send something back, so he couldn't meet me. There were several red flags in our interaction. Within just two days of chatting, he revealed too much personal information about himself, including his salary, investment details, and even information about his family and ex-girlfriend. He didn't hold back when sharing these details. Within three days, he expressed strong feelings for me. He also brought up the private equity project suddenly and mentioned his boss, David Chen. Given my suspicions about his words and actions, I decided to do some research and came across similar scams and storylines reported on a website. Fortunately, I only wasted five days of my time on this person and nothing more. I'm sharing my story here to raise awareness and encourage everyone to be cautious and alert.
At first, they said they needed to check if I could pay the loan. They transferred $1200 to my account, and I was required to pay $1700 to get my loan approved. After I transferred the $1700, they said I needed to make one more payment of $1700 to approve the loan. This is when I realized I had been scammed. I made a police report the next day, so please be wary! The company which this person claimed to be from was 'Pl Credi? Pte Ltd', and the person's name is Kevin, reachable at 8806 455?
I received a call from 94348446 with an automated voice recording. It stated that I had an uncollected letter from ICA. However, I hung up immediately upon hearing this. To verify the authenticity of the call, I checked the ICA website and logged in, but there doesn't appear to be any letter waiting for me. I wanted to report this incident here because I believe ICA should be informed, and they may want to take appropriate action.
I received a WhatsApp video call from a man impersonating a policeman. He was dressed in a police uniform, wearing a face mask, and had a "Singapore Police" banner in the background. The call was made from the number +6584080413. Initially, he asked me to show my identification card, but I didn't have it with me at that time. Consequently, he requested that I share my FIN (Foreign Identification Number), which I unfortunately did.Then, the scammer proceeded to ask me to display my ATM debit card. I reluctantly showed the front side of the card, but when he asked for the back side, I refused. Furthermore, he sent me an OTP (One-Time Password) and requested that I share it. At this point, my suspicions were aroused. Why would a policeman need my ATM details? Upon inspection, I realized that the OTP I received was from the Shopee website, indicating that the scammer was attempting to steal my card information to carry out transactions on Shopee.Throughout the call, I could hear the sounds of police sirens in the background. Fortunately, no money was stolen, although I had unfortunately shared my FIN.This scam represents a new and sophisticated approach where scammers are utilizing WhatsApp video calls and disguising themselves as policemen to deceive unsuspecting individuals.
Now scammers are using the local number 81665620 to make calls. An AI voice states that they are from "ICA" with important documents that require our attention, and they request us to press an option on the phone. Please simply hang up and block this number, 81665620.

This person called me and addressed me by my Chinese name, asking me to guess who he is and if I remember him. It was evident from his accent that he is Malaysian. I responded that I don't remember him and inquired about his identity. He claimed to be Jason. However, I have friends named Jason, and they all speak English. Since no one uses my Chinese name, I am certain he is a scammer. One of my clients had a similar encounter and suffered financial losses, so this is not a new occurrence for me. It's important for everyone to exercise caution and be careful.
He called me pretending to be my friend, claiming that he had lost his phone. He knew my name and even mentioned my friend's name, which made me dismiss any suspicion as he sounded exactly like my friend. The following day, he called me again seeking help, stating that he was locked out of his POSB account and needed to transfer funds to a contractor. I made the transfer but became suspicious of his story. I decided to call my friend's number and discovered that I had been scammed. I immediately filed a police report and contacted the bank. The transferred amount exceeded $3,000
A scammer called claiming to be KC, a Malaysian working in Singapore. He said he changed his number but sounded exactly like him. He asked me to add him on WhatsApp and continue the conversation there. He mentioned the need to pay a contractor and asked for assistance on registering a new PayNow number. I taught him how to register, but he mentioned his bank account was locked. He requested my help to make a payment of $1,000 and promised to reimburse me tomorrow.
I missed the call, so I called back. The person somehow knew my name and claimed to be a long-lost friend. He said he had a new number and told me to save it. I asked, "Who are you?" but he refused to reveal his identity and replied, "Aiyo, you don't know me? Can't you tell who I am from my voice?" in a heavy Malaysian accent. I immediately hung up as it was clearly a ruse. Please do not fall for this! The number looked like a normal mobile phone number, which is why I called back.

Laura Wang from Indeed recruitment company contacted me about a job opportunity and introduced me to another lady named Anna (HP: +6593432495) from 42matters. Anna mentioned a website @ www.42matters-work.xyz (Note: Scam website. Do not click) where I needed to log in and create my own account using my mobile number for registration. She even provided a referral code that I needed to use during registration. The work involved optimizing developers' app data for 42matters, and we were promised a commission (salary approximately 50-200 SGD per day). However, due to my scepticism, I did not register through the website.
First they chat you on WhatsApp asking you to take part in a survey. They will pay you immediately $15. Then they will ask you to like Shopee ads and pay you $2 for each like. After receiving about $50 in total they will lure you to top up $88 and return you a higher amount like $110. After which, they will ask you to top up even more which by then you won't be able to withdraw.
A female approached me via WhatsApp and offered me a job with an unusually high salary by helping them with a "complete optimization job." She provided me with the website https://www.sg-42matters.xyz (Note: Scam site), but I immediately noticed that the website had been recently established. The whole concept revolves around them training you for simple tasks, with the eventual aim of persuading you to deposit money to "upgrade" your membership status and supposedly earn more money. However, all the money you supposedly earn is held within their web application. In order to withdraw the salary you earned, they required you to provide them with your bank account details.
The signs are obvious, spelling errors and grammatical mistakes in his messages in telegram (name: Dianne) followed by whatsapp msg from 90429575, inviting me to review and like apps on apple store to improve ratings. The person went on to offer salary, too good to be true. Please be safe everyone!
My friend received a phone call from an unknown caller with the phone number +6590789968. The caller introduced himself as "Brian." Brian is my English name and is known among our friends. This "Brian" claimed to have lost his phone and provided this new number as his contact. He then asked my friend to lend him S$5,000 for house renovations. Trusting the caller, my friend transferred the requested amount to a Standard Chartered account with the number 01278059??, under the name PURRNIE??? (HP: +65893628??). The transfers occurred on May 17 and 18, 2023, as two separate transactions. After sending all the money, my friend repeatedly called the caller "Brian" on the same phone number but received no response. On May 20, 2023, my friend contacted me on my phone number, and I informed her that I hadn't lost my phone, had no plans to renovate my house, and hadn't asked her for any money. We immediately reported this incident to the police.
I received an unknown call. The person who called me knew my name and claimed to be my friend. He said he had lost his phone and asked me to save his number. When I asked him, "Who are you?" he refused to reveal his identity and replied, "Aiyo, you don't know me? I'm very sad. I've known you for a long time already." However, his voice didn't sound familiar to me at all. I warned him that if he didn't tell me who he was, I would hang up, and he promptly ended the call. Please be careful and do not engage with such callers. It's advisable to block their number immediately.
There is no '+65' in front of the number, indicating that the scammer is using a local cell phone. The recorded message appears to be the same as the previous one: '欧南园警擦局' in the English version. When I responded in a different accent, the caller ended the call.
Caller called me and asked me to guess who he was. said that he lost his phone and changed number, expecting me to save his number. called me again the following monday by then i already verified and confirmed with my colleagues that he did not call me or change his number recently.
I came across a listing on Carousell for a rental unit posted by a Carousell account named Keaen Lim (@K3A3NL1M-82601). After inquiring about the availability of the unit, I received a call from an agent. The agent's name is Desmond Yong, and his contact details are as follows: WhatsApp number: +65 9860 82??? Email: desmond.yong@erarealtynetworks.com During the phone call, he requested that I send my working pass for the letter of intent and the invoice, which were required for viewing the unit (reservation). After signing the documents, he instructed me to make the payment using the following savings account: POSB SAV: 198275??? I was informed to make separate payments for each month, as it is a two-year lease and requires a one-month deposit. The total amount required is 9000 SGD. After an hour, I became suspicious of the agent and decided to search for him on Google. I came across a LinkedIn profile with the same name but noticed that the profile picture had been copied from a different person. Furthermore, the agent's mobile number and email address were not listed on the CEA website. As a result, I decided to file a police report. Unfortunately, the WhatsApp number is still active and the individual behind it continues to scam numerous people to this day...
I received a call from a guy claiming to be a friend, who asked me to guess his identity and insisted that I save his number. A day later, he called again and asked for assistance on changing his phone number in the DBS app. He even sent me a screenshot of his account balance showing $34,000. Shortly after, he called again and explained that he couldn't use his account to pay the supplier due to a 24-hour waiting period. He urgently requested me to transfer $1700 to his supplier. I asked for the PayNow number and other relevant information. However, when I asked for his surname, he provided the wrong one. My friend's surname is Sim, not Tan. I tried to call him back to clarify his name, but he hung up on me. His number is a StarHub number, and I was unable to reach him by calling back.
The scam took place over two days. On the first day, I received a call from the number 86289701. The caller claimed to be a friend whose name I couldn't recall, and they informed me that they had changed their number. On the second day, they called again, asking for help with PayNow since they had changed their number. I tried to assist them, but my efforts were in vain. They told me they had been locked out of their bank account and asked if I could help by transferring money to another number, 805245??, with the promise to resolve the issue later. At the end of the day, when I tried to follow up, I realized I had been blocked, and all their messages had been deleted.
I received a call around 10:45 am on my landline, and it was someone claiming to be a Singtel staff member with a strong Indian accent. They asked if my house's internet connection was working fine. They mentioned that Singtel had detected unusually high internet usage between 11 pm and 3 am for the past five days and inquired if I knew of anyone else using the internet or if there were any issues. They then proceeded to ask me to check my router, etc. Before they could finish their sentence, I asked them to call back in the evening instead. I was skeptical if it could be a scam, but it sounded genuine as it involved a real human interaction rather than a voice-generated one. I needed some time to check. Afterward, I checked a scam alert website and found a similar story.
I keep receiving calls from Singapore numbers like 81704708 and 84139562, and they all sound like the same person. They usually start the conversation with phrases like "Hey (My Name), I have just changed my number" or "Guess who I am," and their scripts have become so familiar that I can almost memorize them. I'm not sure what their intention is, as I always hang up quickly, but these calls have transitioned from scam attempts to almost harassment.
During our initial contact, he mentioned that the purpose of his call was to inform me that he had changed his number, but he failed to disclose his identity. When I asked him who he was, he tried to prompt me to guess by suggesting I think of someone close to me, someone who would speak to me in a similar manner, etc. However, I was confident that this was a fraudulent and phishing attempt, so I promptly ended the call. It is worth noting that the mobile number he used was locally registered.
Similar to the situation described in the article found at https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-17Apr2023215222PM, scammers often employ tactics to appear genuine and friendly on WhatsApp before inviting you to join group chats. I was recently asked to create an account on "https://chimera-maintenance.com" (Note: Scam website, do not click) where I was told to deposit money in order to perform ratings and receive commissions. Don't even try to even cash out as you are revealing your bank details to scammers before they could transfer funds into your account.
I received a call on my landline from an individual with a strong Indian accent, claiming to be from Singtel's technical department. He informed me that there had been suspicious internet activity originating from my broadband over the past few days. Upon answering the call, there was no automated voice message, just the scammer speaking directly. However, the conversation was unclear as there were frequent interruptions and disconnections. I did not continue the call, but the scammer asked for certain information such as the residents in my house and requested that I close my laptop. I couldn't hear him properly as I was focused on demanding his phone number and name. Later on, I called Singtel's technical support at 1688 to confirm whether they had made any such calls to my landline. They verified that no such call had been placed by them.
On May 17, at 1 pm, I received a cold call. The initial number used by the caller was +92 3404541747. I mentioned that I would only answer calls from Singapore numbers. As a result, they called again using the number +65 8134 4202. The callers identified themselves as two Singapore police officers and displayed badges that said "Warrant Officer" (I couldn't read their names). They were dressed in police uniforms and wore black face masks. The background of the video call showed the Ang Mo Kio police station. During the call, they requested my IC number and asked me to show it through the video call. I declined to provide any information or show my IC number. At that point, they became aggressive and threatened to block my bank account. I decided to end the call. It's important to note that both "officers" spoke with a Filipino accent. Fortunately, I did not incur any losses. This is just to share my encounter with others.
I received a call from an HR worker at J&amp;T Asset Management who asked me to contact a supervisor named Flos. She assigned me some simple tasks, such as copying and pasting to boost Agoda sales. She mentioned that there would be a commission for each task. However, there were also some tougher tasks, like adding on orders and transferring money. After some time, I realised I got scammed.
I met someone on the CMB dating app in March 2023, and we later moved our conversation to WhatsApp. He informed me that he had deleted the dating app and expressed his sincerity about being in a relationship. However, he never showed any intention of meeting in person and only made promises to do so during the initial stages. He frequently shared photos of food and boasted about his wealth, mentioning his affluent friends who treated him to expensive meals. He constantly checked in on me and took every opportunity to persuade me to invest in cryptocurrency. When I expressed hesitation, he suggested that he could provide me with the money for my initial investment, framing it as an investment for our future together. This proposal came after just two weeks of our WhatsApp conversations. When I rejected the offer, he became angry and sent multiple audio messages in response.

I received a call from a guy who sounded Malaysian. He kept using the word "bro" frequently and asked me to guess his identity. He wanted me to save his number as it was his new number. After a few minutes of conversation without him clarifying who he was, I decided to end the call. He didn't call back.
Beware of a scammer who contacted me on WhatsApp using the number +601169730349, claiming to be from the marketing department of singsale. They asked me to participate in an online shopping app survey. I completed the survey but did not receive the promised $15 transfer through Pay Now. Instead, they insisted I join a Telegram chat group to receive the $15, which made me suspicious, so I refused to continue. Here's the scam message I received: "Hello, my name is Sapphire, and I'm from the marketing department at singsale. Have a great day! ❤❤ We are conducting a paid survey about online shopping platforms. Can you help? Answer 3 simple questions and receive S$15 via PayNow."
I was contacted on Instagram by a woman named Ellie who claimed to be a 28-year-old HR worker. We became friends, and she shared pictures of her daily activities, making me believe she was a genuine person. Eventually, she approached me with a task related to her work contract at Style Tribute. She explained that I needed to transfer money to a merchant account and would receive a refund with a commission to help boost the company's sales and visibility. Despite my initial skepticism, I decided to give it a try, and it worked for a small amount. However, as the tasks progressed, the third one required me to transfer a significant sum of $12,000. To complete it, I had to borrow money from my friends. Unfortunately, the task faced delays, and I ended up having to pay additional fees to unfreeze the transaction. Things took a turn when I received a call from customer service, demanding an extra $2,000 for verification purposes before releasing my refund and commission. Sensing something was amiss, I refused to pay and reported the situation to the police. It was later confirmed that I had fallen victim to a scam. Even after involving the authorities, the woman continued to threaten me. She even sent a picture of policemen to intimidate me. It was a distressing experience, and I lost all the money I had invested, leaving me with the difficult task of slowly repaying my friends.
I received a call from an unknown number. The caller, who sounded like a Malaysian female, claimed to be a friend I had recently met. However, she did not directly reveal her name and instead asked me to guess who she was while providing general descriptions such as having long hair and wearing glasses. I gave a random name, and she informed me that she had recently changed her phone number, urging me to save it. She mentioned opening a new café at Northpoint and invited me to attend the opening so she could treat me to a meal. During the call, she did not make any requests related to money. It's important for us to stay vigilant to avoid scams!
I was contacted by someone claiming to be from Shopee's marketing department, conducting a market share survey in Singapore to assess customer satisfaction with using Shopee and their shopping experience. They mentioned that I would be rewarded with SGD 11 after answering four questions to help improve the survey. Afterward, another person reached out to me, instructing me to complete tasks in order to claim the $11 reward. However, both of the initial contacts ceased working after our interaction. I was then directed to a person named Rikki on Telegram to complete the tasks, and I was added to a group chat. Each task involved liking Shopee pages they provided, with a value of $2 per task. They claimed that after completing around eight tasks, a payout would be made. However, after a full day, they asked me to make a payment via PayNow to "boost merchant sales," promising that I would receive the money back. Recognizing that this seemed too good to be true, I raised several questions and privately warned others about the situation. As a result, I was kicked out of the group, possibly alerting accounts managed by fellow scammers. Unfortunately, some individuals had already transferred money to them.
I received a call from an individual who identified themselves as a Malaysian Chinese guy. Instead of disclosing his identity when I asked, he insisted on playing a guessing game. He claimed to have lost his wallet and phone, resulting in a change of phone number. He then mentioned opening an eatery with his friend and invited me to attend the launch. The following day, on May 13th, he contacted me again and asked to borrow money urgently to pay his supplier. I informed him that I didn't have any money to lend. I suggested that he should contact his good friend in Singapore instead of reaching out to me, and I promptly ended the call. To ensure the accuracy of the situation, I verified with our mutual good friend, who confirmed that it was indeed a scam..
I was contacted on Telegram by someone offering a job to help boost clicks for brands. Despite my skepticism about potential scams, I decided to give it a try and went through the introductory training they provided. However, things took a suspicious turn when they asked me to deposit money before I could proceed further. I questioned the need for such a payment in order to do a job and immediately called them out as scammers. Their defensive reactions only reinforced my suspicions. I left the group chat, reported their activities, and blocked their numbers to prevent any further contact.
He initiated contact with me on Instagram on 11/03/2023 and later switched to the LINE app. He claimed to work as a contract manager at Tyto LLC in Singapore and mentioned frequent business trips abroad. We discussed marital status, children, and family situations. He shared daily activities such as eating, working, future plans, and hobbies through pictures. According to him, he was unmarried, had no parents, but had one son who might study abroad depending on the circumstances. After a month of building trust and interest, he expressed excitement about a construction project contract and embarked on a business trip to Ecuador. He shared pictures of the airport, food, and the work site to strengthen trust. However, he encountered difficulties in transferring money for materials due to weak Wi-Fi, and he asked for my help. He provided his bank account information for me to log in and facilitate the money transfer. Once the transfer was successful, he continued to ask for assistance with subsequent transactions. Unfortunately, problems arose when the bank locked the account, citing the unregistered location as the reason for the transaction failure. He claimed to have no cash, debit card, or friends to rely on, as the company had transferred all his money to his bank account for the Ecuador project. He insisted that only I could help him in this situation. He requested a payment of $15,500 to reactivate his bank account, promising to refund the amount afterward. However, even after the payment, his bank account remained inactive. The company terminated his contract, jeopardizing his job. In a desperate rush, he begged me to find money and provided the contact information of three or four individuals who could potentially solve the problem. He implored me to buy a flight ticket from Ecuador to Singapore, promising to refund double the amount as gratitude for resolving his predicament. Upon paying $3,000 for the ticket, he vanished along with the money and all the information he had given me, including his passport, phone number, and home address, turned out to be fake.
Met a guy on OkCupid who claims to be a construction engineer and associate director at the Building Construction Authority. He says he earns $30k per month and has a personal assistant who chauffeurs him to fancy restaurants where he meets clients. We started chatting on WhatsApp, and he regularly shares pictures of his daily life, including food, golf outings, and more. He mentioned how his boss introduced him to Ye Gang, the COO of Sea Limited, during a golf session. He sees Ye Gang as an inspiration and someone who has helped him greatly. He explained how HDB uses private placements to raise money for different phases of their developments and how Ye Gang gave him an invitation code to participate in these private placements. According to him, these placements are similar to fixed deposits, where you invest your principal for 60-90 days and receive your principal plus interest at the end of the commitment period, without any risks. We tried to arrange meetups twice, but he canceled at the last minute due to work-related travel that lasted 1-2 weeks. He even suggested a date after his trip to keep me interested. Then he asked me to take pictures of a nearby BTO project, claiming he needed them to decide whether to participate in the private placement for that project. Upon researching, I found similar stories where others were eventually asked to join the private placement and ended up losing money.
Beware of a scammer who contacted me via WhatsApp using the number +601169905148, claiming to be from Research Pacific Group Marketing. They asked me to participate in a survey regarding Lazada/Shopee purchases. I completed the survey, and they transferred $15 to me through PayNow. However, their accountant only had a Telegram account, so I had to contact them through that platform. Soon after, they forcefully added me to a Telegram chat group and instructed me to like several items using a SingSale link. Once I completed three tasks, they transferred an additional $9 to me. The scammer explained that this was a prepaid task requiring an upfront payment. Other members of the group shared suspicious and likely fake screenshots of their supposed transfers. The scammer then demanded that I transfer a deposit ranging from $66 to $6,666, promising it would be returned later. Please exercise caution as this Telegram group consists of 200 members.
I received a robocall about a suspicious online transaction on my SC credit card (8351???). The message instructed me to press "1" to speak to their officer. A woman then spoke to me, informing me about a new SC credit card ending in 79xx that had an online transaction of SGD3328 on Carousell Malaysia. She stated that the transaction was currently on hold by the SC system. According to her, the new credit card had been applied for on April 19th and approved on April 27th. However, I denied ever receiving this new credit card. The woman concluded that this was a scam and provided me with a case number, "SC-22-3436-29," advising me to report it to the police. She offered to connect me directly to the police hotline. When I asked for the telephone number to call back myself, she quickly initiated the connection. Unfortunately, the call was disconnected, but she promptly called me back using the number 84076980 and reconnected me to the "police" hotline. A "police officer" answered the call and requested my full name and IC number. He then asked me to switch to WhatsApp for recording purposes in order to file the police report. On WhatsApp, he displayed his "Police ID card" as Ng Qi Han but removed it after I verified it. He suggested performing a comprehensive check in the police system to see if any of my other cards were involved in scams. In the background, I heard his colleague mention that one of my bank accounts was being used to receive unknown overseas funds. At this point, I realized it was a scam and immediately ended the call.
On March 24th, I encountered a person named Joshua Tan on the Coffee Meet Bagel dating app. We switched our conversation to WhatsApp, where he sent me a video of him deleting the dating app, expressing his sincerity about a relationship, and urging me to do the same. The following day, he called me and claimed to work as a cybersecurity professional at IBM. He shared pictures of food and boasted about his wealth, including his monthly salary of $20,000, his condo at Stirling Residences, and his car. He repeatedly brought up a private placement investment opportunity offered by Andrew, the CFO of "Guoco Group." Shortly after mentioning that he would be traveling to Indonesia for a two-week work trip, he asked me to take photos of a BTO project for him. As a token of gratitude, he invited me to invest my money alongside him. Despite never meeting in person during the initial two weeks, I trusted him due to his daily phone calls, which seemed intended to build trust. He was a Malaysian who could speak Chinese, Hokkien (Penang Accent), and Cantonese. I became involved in the investment scheme, starting with an initial investment of $500, which yielded a return of $60 the following day. In the second incident, he convinced me to try investing $10,000, but it turned out to be a trap. He claimed the $10,000 was for booking purposes and required an additional $40,000 to secure a return of $11,000, along with my initial $50,000 investment. Once the returns were secured, he claimed my password was incorrect, freezing my account. To unfreeze it, he insisted that I topped up $70,000 within 48 hours. Meanwhile, he claimed to have borrowed money from his colleagues, friends, and boss to help me overcome the situation. He led me to believe that since he topped up my initial investment, I could trust him. However, as soon as the money was deposited, he declared that my credit score was below 60 and prevented me from making withdrawals. All my savings were tied up in the investment, and he continued to request more money to increase my credit score within 48 hours. He even asked me to borrow personal loans from banks, friends, and private lenders. Upon seeking help from my friends, they advised me against it and encouraged me to report the incident to the police. From that point on, he ignored me when I refused to deposit more money, and the link he shared (https://www.gclpvtpmsg.com/) became invalid. Although his contact number in Singapore was no longer valid, his WhatsApp account remained active online. After my experience, I discovered several similar stories involving GuocoLand. I lost a total of $92,000, and I am currently relying on borrowed money from my close friends for daily expenses, which makes me feel awful.
My story is similar to this one: https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-04May2023225901PM So long story short I was scammed exactly like this person, except that i chose the higher amount for the 2nd advanced task which is $1500 and ended up losing around $70k first, I was contacted by someone from Whatsapp, named Linda, number +60 18-228 0975 for a remote job. At first I was told to just write Google review for 5 SGD each. Then after that they told me in order to become permanent employees/members, I would need to do advanced sales task. My first advanced task is to deposit 200 SGD to their designated account, which I did. Then they told me to go to this website https://chartercom-sgiyq.pages.dev/ to register an account and instruct me to withdraw money there. I did as they said, and I got 200 SGD plus 40 SGD like they promised. However they said in order for me to officially become permanent members, I would need to do more advanced tasks, which I deposited $1500 and then, in my desperate attempts to recover it, lost another ~ $70K
I received a scam call on 9/5/23 at 7.11 pm. The caller addressed me by name correctly and informed me that she had recently changed her contact number. The caller sounded like a Chinese Malaysian woman. She claimed to be a long-lost friend and repeatedly asked me to guess her identity. She provided additional details, stating that she is chubby and wears glasses. When I insisted that I did not recognise her voice and could only recognize faces, she abruptly ended the call upon realizing that she could not extract any personal details from me.
I received an automated voice call to authorize a transaction on a Metro UOB Visa credit card that I do not own. I was connected to a customer service officer who identified himself as Thomas Chan. He informed me that I had allegedly applied for the card at the Tampines UOB branch on April 24th at 2 pm. He also provided me with the name of the bank officer involved. He then proceeded to state that he would freeze the card and connect me to the CAD police. An "officer" came on the line, identifying himself as Inspector Lee Wei Ming. He sent me a WhatsApp message with his police ID and proceeded to ask for my personal details, claiming that I was a suspect in a highly confidential money laundering case involving ICBC Bank and Shirina Sheling. He warned that if I went to the police station, I would be arrested. I continued to press for verification of his identity, and he sent me a photo of the CAD office at the Cantonment Police Station. Following this, I proceeded to lodge a report at the police station.
I received a call on May 9th, 2023, at 08:53 am informing me about a charge of SGD4k on my UOB Credit card ending with #4983. I informed the caller that I do not own a UOB credit card and was then told that the card was issued under my NRIC. I requested to reject the charge and the card that I do not owe, but I was informed that my NRIC information was necessary for verification. Without thinking, I disclosed and confirmed my NRIC and name. Then, I realised it was a scam. Beware of unknown phone calls claiming to be from banks!
The email I received from my company email address appears in my junk email almost every week. I don't even have a Western Union account, so I'm unsure if it is real or fake. Scam email that I received:- Dear beneficiary, After conducting thorough investigations and research at Western Union and MoneyGram Headquarters, we discovered your email in the Western Union database. It appears that you have sent money through Western Union and MoneyGram, suggesting that you may have been swindled by unscrupulous individuals who deceived you into sending money through Western Union/MoneyGram for a non-existent fund. As a result, a meeting was held involving the Board of Directors of Western Union, MoneyGram, the FBI, and the Ministry of Finance and Homeland Security. Following our investigations, it has been agreed that you should be compensated with the sum of One Million One Hundred United States Dollars ($1,100,000.00) to start an investment. The financing for this compensation is being provided by the United States Department of the Treasury, specifically allocated for victims. The FBI will oversee this case, and we have already submitted your details to them to facilitate the processing of your funds. Please contact the Department of the Treasury using the information provided below: Contact Person: John Killough Email: johnkw97@gmail.com Cell Phone: (209)-536-8512 Yours sincerely, Agent Christopher Wray
I met a woman on the cMB app, which was a rare occurrence for me as I don't usually get many matches. She introduced herself as working at GuocoLand under the Hong Leong Group. She mentioned that she was going overseas to Kuala Lumpur for an exchange program, and due to privacy reasons, her camera access would be blocked by the IT department. Then, unexpectedly, she asked me to take photos of an unfinished BTO (YCK Beacon) because she wanted to check on the progress as she was considering investing in the project. After a few days of talking, she suddenly brought up an opportunity to earn extra cash and provided me with a link. She asked me to sign up and explained the mechanics of how it worked. She said that if I joined, it would improve our "relationship" with the extra cash flow. The first thing that caught my attention was the mention of NFTs and the metaverse, which raised a red flag for me. The website she directed me to seemed authentic, even containing certificates from GuocoLand. She explained that it was a project shared by GuocoLand and the government, which further increased my suspicions. Throughout this experience, I had read similar stories, and I believe scammers use various tactics to manipulate people. If you start to have doubts, it's important to back off immediately because it's likely part of a scam. The phrase "too good to be true" perfectly describes this situation. I hope my fellow single Singaporeans won't become victims of love scams.
Shortly after returning to Singapore, I received a robocall from what appeared to be a Singaporean number. The automated voice stated, "You have a letter pending from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. Please select 1 for further information in English, select 2 for Mandarin." What made this call unsettling was its timing, occurring just one day after my flight. It's highly unlikely that this timing was random. It suggests that either the airline system or an official system (such as immigration or the arrival card) used during travel has been compromised, providing real-time information to scammers.
I received a WhatsApp message from someone named Nafisha, who claimed to recruit Google Maps reviewers after finding my resume on JobStreet. They offered $5 per review, which seemed like a simple and attractive side job. I was then added to a Telegram group where other reviewers were present, and they promised payments ranging from $15 to $30. However, things took a turn when they started promoting an investment opportunity called 'advance payment' for a cryptocurrency website development. They asked for an $800 investment with a promise of a $1040 return. It didn't stop there; I had to invest multiple times to withdraw the money. The investment value seemed to increase once I joined. They even created a smaller group with fake members to deceive us. Eventually, I realized it was a scam and stopped paying. The company involved in this scam is called Charter Group, and the person I communicated with was named Nafisah. I deeply regret falling into this cycle of deception.
They used the same tactic on me as with other victims here. I received a call from a Malaysian Chinese man who claimed to have changed his number, without a prefix. He refused to disclose his identity and made me guess, dropping hints that he works in Singapore as a Malaysian. I suspected he might be my work contractor, and he confirmed it was him. Without much hesitation, I updated his number in my phone. The next morning, he called me again, asking if I knew how to update a phone number on the POSB iBanking app because he needed to transfer money but couldn't receive the OTP. I provided him with step-by-step instructions via WhatsApp. Shortly after, he called again, claiming that he followed the procedure but got locked out due to too many unsuccessful attempts. The bank's hotline informed him that he needed to visit the branch in person, but he was busy with work and the transaction was urgent. He then asked if I could help by initiating a transfer of $1000, assuring me that he would repay me in the afternoon after contacting a friend for the remaining amount. Realizing it was a scam, I stopped communicating with him, and he deleted some messages on WhatsApp, including the one with his voice.
I met a guy on CMB, and we chatted on the app before moving to Telegram. He claimed to live in Holland Village at The Ford condominium and work as an IT project manager at Wizlynx Pte Ltd, a security company. We had normal conversations, and he shared photos of his daily life and food. Suddenly, he said he had to travel to Jakarta, Indonesia, for work at IBM. He sent me photos from the airport, road signs, and his hotel. We couldn't meet or use Facetime due to supposed security reasons. He explained that his phone was required to have a prevented camera app installed by IBM staff for safety purposes. However, we could still communicate through voice calls. I Googled the Jakarta software company, and the road sign he sent matched the area near IBM. This made me believe his story. We continued chatting daily for 2-3 weeks, and one day he asked me to help him by taking photos of a partially completed BTO project called Costa Grove since he couldn't come back to Singapore. He started sharing investment opportunities, specifically in Costa Grove, and created a private account for me to invest in. He provided links and a guide for using the website, claiming it was a risk-free opportunity related to Guocoland projects. He mentioned that the link would frequently change for security reasons. He assured me that it was a genuine opportunity and I made some small earnings from it. When I asked for his phone number, he refused but gave me his Instagram username. Later on, he asked me to increase my ATM credit limits to the maximum and join a project called Metaverse Project. He pressured me to deposit money into the app within 48 hours, warning that failure to do so would result in the loss of my deposit. He even suggested taking a bank loan to top up the website. It was at this point that I realized I had been deceived. I wanted to share my story to prevent others from falling victim to love or investment scams.
I received a call on WhatsApp from the number +65 8901 3293, and the caller claimed to be from the Crime Branch of the Singapore Police. They demanded my bank details, accusing me of being involved in a scam. When I asked which police station branch they were calling from, the caller became rude and yelled at me for the information. I confronted them, calling them a scammer, and they responded with offensive language before disconnecting the call. It's important to note that their WhatsApp profile displayed the logo of the Singapore Police.
It started with a WhatsApp message from Cherylynn, who claimed to recruit reviewers on Google Maps after finding my resume on JobStreet. Each review paid $5, which seemed like an easy and nice side job. I was then invited to a Telegram group where many reviewers were present, and this group offered participants payments ranging from $20 to $30. However, they started promoting an investment opportunity called 'advance payment' for the development of a cryptocurrency website. It began with a $800 investment promising a return of $1017. The investments didn't stop there; I had to invest at least twice to withdraw the money. The investment value appeared to rise once I became part of it. They created a smaller group, with two scammers pretending to be genuine members. I had to keep investing more to recover my initial funds. Eventually, I decided to cut my losses of $4000 SGD, but someone offered to help. I ended up paying until the total reached $20,000 SGD. The company involved is called Charter Group, and I had a conversation with a person named Kevin. I deeply regret being caught in this cycle.
A Singaporean number contacted me on WhatsApp, claiming to be from Indeed and offering a part-time job. They directed me to a platform called www.42ma????.works, supposedly affiliated with the real company "42matters". The job involved earning commissions for completing tasks, promising $50-100 per day and a base salary of $800 for logging in five days in a row. They added me to a WhatsApp group with 13 others for any questions I had. However, I decided to verify the website's affiliation with the real company through their live chat, and they confirmed that they had no association with it. Despite discovering the scam, I managed to withdraw my "profits" of $70+ to my bank account. It's a good practice to verify with the claimed company whether the website or contact person is endorsed by them to avoid falling victim to scams.
A hiring manager reached out to me via WhatsApp after seeing my resume on Jobstreet. Although I wasn't looking for a job, she offered me a freelance job as a Google reviewer with the objective of boosting visibility for their clients. I was skeptical at first, but decided to give it a try since it didn't harm anyone. I was added to a Telegram chat and paid for the reviews I provided. Later, I was asked to complete tasks posted by an administrator in a group chat. These tasks involved giving Google reviews on food and places, and I was reimbursed for them. I was then asked to complete more advanced tasks, the first of which involved boosting clicks and transactions on a cryptocurrency platform. I chose to test it out with the lowest amount of $200, and I was refunded my principal and a commission of $40 after following the given instructions. As a result, I believed that they needed help to boost transactions and clicks, and I got my commission back quickly. The manager informed me that I needed to complete two advance tasks a day to be reimbursed for the rest of the Google reviews. I requested to do the $200 advance task again as my second task, but I was informed that I could only do it once, and that I had to move on to the next level of advance task.
I met a guy on CMB and we chatted on the app before moving to WhatsApp. He then showed me a video of him deleting the CMB app and sent me photos of food and his daily life. However, when we confirmed a date to meet, he suddenly got deployed to Indonesia for work, and we were unable to meet or use Facetime due to security reasons. Despite this, we continued chatting daily for 2-3 weeks, and I even helped him take photos of a half-done BTO project. He then started sharing the investments he made and created an account for me to invest privately. He gave me links and a guide on how to use the website, which was related to Guocoland projects and part of the Hong Leong Group. He claimed it was a real deal and asked me to upgrade my membership tier by topping up money. He also asked me to increase my ATM credit limits to the maximum and inquired about the number of bank accounts I had. He repeatedly asked me to top up money for investment and assured me that I would earn money. I almost fell for it, but after reading similar stories, I blocked him. I hope women like me won't fall victim to love or investment scams.
I received a call from +6616591088318 claiming to be from HSBC, informing me that a credit card had been reported from HSBC in my name. However, I had not requested for any credit card. The caller transferred me to "MAS" to make a complaint on my account. During the call, the person asked for a lot of my DBS account details, which I suspect is related to a HSBC scam attack.
I was contacted by "Ms. Tina" from the HR department of Charter Communications on WhatsApp. She claimed that my LinkedIn and JobStreet profiles were recommended to her, but I did not share my contact number on LinkedIn. She said that her company is hiring online staff to promote various merchants and that the working hours are flexible, with potential earnings ranging from $3,000 to $15,000. She claimed that they have an office in MBFC Tower 2. However, I was asked to do a test review on an attraction in Singapore and prove my PayNow number or Singapore bank account number. When I asked questions about the job, she hurried me to proceed and her language skills were not up to par for an HR representative. The entire situation seemed dubious, and I am sharing this for anyone who may come across a similar online job offer.
I don't have a bank account with UOB, but this morning I received an automated voice call from them claiming that I had made a $3000 transaction. I immediately realized that it was a scam call and hung up without divulging any information. Fortunately, I did not suffer any losses as a result of the call.
I received a WhatsApp message from a woman named Helen (+65 8194 6973), who claimed to be a hiring manager. She asked me if I was looking for a job, and I replied with a yes. Helen then explained that the job could be done from home with a mobile phone for 50 minutes a day, and offered a commission of $100 per day. The job description was to assist online merchants worldwide in generating purchase records for their products, allowing the merchant to profit and the employee to earn a commission. However, having been scammed twice before, I recognized this as a scam. Therefore, I would like to remind the public to be vigilant and not fall for such fraudulent schemes.
A scammer called me claiming to have lost her wallet and handphone. She provided me with her new phone number. Two days later, she requested my assistance in paying her supplier $3700 for coffee machines and other necessities to open her new café.

I received a call from a phone number 8187 5948 at about 0850hrs on 29 apr 2023. it was a scam call. the female automated voice claimed the call was from "UOB" and that i had a transaction of SGD3K plus on my credit card number ending with 1118 and that i needed to press 1 to approve the transaction. my card number doesn't end with 1118. needless to say, I didn't approve and terminated the call. i then used skype to call the 8187 5948 phone number. it was disconnected after a few rings. Obviously one of the many scammers out there.

As I have a few friends named Gary, I asked 'which Gary is he?'. He replied Gary Sim. I repeat 'oh Gary Sim, from Navy is it?', and he replied 'Ya. And this my new number, pls save it.'

(BTW, my friend Gary don't have a Surname Sim) 3. on 280423, at 1151hrs, he called. He's straightaway asked if I know how to reset the paynow number. I said 'I know and BTW, who are u?'

All conversation was in Mandarin and he spoke like a Singaporean.

They directly contacted me through my email after i applied. Then they contacted me through my WhatsApp, they explained that they are group to help increase the visibility of worldwide hotels.

The third task was not refunded yet as they asked me to complete the bonus task. Unfortunately, i booked the wrong order. Then they encouraged me to do anothee booking and paid once more as it needs one payment. As stupid as i was, i did as how they instructed me. Then, they reasoned that they couldn't refund yet as i need to do a clearing task to clear my mistake record which the prices booking were getting higher and higher. I requested for a lower price, but they reasoned that it was randomly from system. As i can't clear the clearing task, they said the money that I had transferred couldn't be refundable.

Please be careful
I received a call with an automated voice message claiming to be from HSBC Bank, stating that a transaction of $630 had been made on my HSBC Mastercard. The message instructed me to press 1 to approve the transaction or 2 to speak to someone. However, I do not have this card and immediately hung up.
A scammer with a Malaysian Chinese accent called me using a number without a +65 prefix. The caller addressed me by my name at the start of the call and claimed to have changed their contact number. When I asked for their identity, the caller replied, "You can't recognise my voice?" I remained silent, and the caller then claimed to be someone named Alex. I quickly hung up the phone. There were two notable things about this call: firstly, the phone number appeared to be a Singaporean number without a +65 prefix, which initially made me believe it was a legitimate call. Secondly, the scammer was able to address me by my name at the beginning of the call, momentarily causing me to consider the possibility that it may be a friend. It wasn't until the caller mentioned a name that none of my friends had that I realized it was a scam. After giving it some thought, I realised that friends would not ask you to guess their identity over a phone call. However, I can understand why people fall prey to these fake friend scams. In the heat of the moment, it is natural to try and identify the caller before realizing it is a scam call.
The prevalence of fake friend call scams has been on the rise recently, and I unfortunately fell victim to one of these scams. The perpetrator, speaking in a Chinese Malaysian accent, called me claiming to be a friend who had recently changed their mobile number. Suspicious of the situation, I remained cautious and questioned the caller about their identity. However, the caller kept insisting that I guess their name, which only raise my suspicion even more!
A scammer contacted me via WhatsApp and asked me to participate in a survey regarding an online shopping platform. I completed the survey, and they transferred $15 to me. Later, they added me to a Telegram chat group and asked me to like several items via the links they provided. After completing four tasks, they transferred another $12 to me. However, things took a turn when the scammer claimed that this was a prepaid task that required upfront payment. Other people in the group began sharing screenshots of their supposed transfers, which looked suspicious and fake. I forwarded one of the screenshots, and the scammer accused me of copying it from someone else. This raised red flags, and I immediately exited the group and blocked the scammer. Luckily, I did not lose any money.
Beware of a man named Cornell Tan (Lee Ping?) from CMB who claims to be an SG PR from Malaysia working at Shopee Singapore for 5 years. After chatting for 3 weeks and exchanging his WhatsApp number, he sent pictures of expensive food every day and flew to Thailand in late March 2023. He asked me to invest in a BTO project near my home on a private equity app called "SEA Top," which his boss, Winston Goh, introduced to him. However, I lost a significant amount of money due to technical issues with the app and was unable to top up anymore. I reported him to the police, and it seems like he has been involved in similar cases before. Be cautious as he can be very charming.
Be wary of a recent missed call from +84128145. After returning the call, a woman with a Malaysian accent knew your name and asked you to save her new contact number on WhatsApp. The next day, she called and asked for assistance in updating her contact number for POSB internet banking. However, she later requested an urgent transfer of $3,800 to a contractor's CIMB account 1003686??? or PayNow 857898?? under the name Cheong Wee Kiat. She promised to repay the next day but vanished after receiving the funds. Be cautious of such fake friends who may contact you to borrow money.
Be cautious of online relationships that escalate too quickly. After adding a woman on Facebook, you began chatting on Messenger and WhatsApp. However, you grew suspicious when she claimed to be in Hangzhou but used a Hong Kong number. She then shared her plan to migrate to Singapore by doing extra work to earn more money. Within a week of chatting, she wanted to become your girlfriend and help you earn more money through cryptocurrency trading using info from her friend. She insisted that I create an account on https://sgxcoins.com/mobile/#/ (Note: Fake website. Do not click) and grew angry when I declined, claiming that if I loved her, I would do it. Eventually, after much persuasion and resistance, she left, claiming that I didn't love her enough. Beware of such scams and online relationships that seem too good to be true.
I received a message offering me $15 for completing a quick 2-question survey. I was skeptical but decided to give it a shot. After completing the survey, I received the promised $15 via paynow from someone named Siti Nabi?? Bin?? Abd??. Shortly after, I was invited to a telegram group where they asked me to buy items from singsale.com.sg. They promised that I would receive a refund for the purchases plus a cash bonus. However, when I saw the screenshots of the "payments made to others", I noticed they all had the same name and the amounts were unrealistically high. I immediately sensed that this was a scam and decided not to purchase anything. This experience taught me to be cautious when offers seem too good to be true.
Recently, I have been receiving frequent calls from various phone numbers, mostly from foreign countries, claiming to be from the immigration and customs authority. The automated voice on the other end of the line requests that I sign some documents, but it all seems fishy to me.
Received a WhatsApp message offering $13 for an online survey. The sender claimed to be Sharon from Shopee, but her name was Carissa Bonner on WhatsApp. Despite repeated pleas for help, I declined. No money was lost, but beware of the contact number +1 724 987 7011. Happened on the week of 17 April.
Received a text message about a work-from-home job opportunity to earn extra income. The message promised a basic salary of $1800 per month, plus daily profits.The scammers will try to persuade you to deposit money and even ask you to borrow from family or friends. Once they have your trust, they will invite you to join a WhatsApp group with other participants who claim to have earned money from the same job.They may use the name of a legitimate company that has been operating in Singapore for many years to make the scam seem credible. However, the website and company may not be real, and the government may not be aware of their activities.Be cautious of this type of scam as it can quickly escalate and result in significant financial loss. They may repeatedly say "trust me," but don't fall for it. It's unlikely for any company to pay you $1800 a month and $20 daily just to click a button.Remember to be careful and verify the legitimacy of any job opportunity before providing personal information or money.
Recently, there have been reports of a new scam targeting Singaporeans via WhatsApp. One such scam involves receiving a message from a business account with the name Monique Christian, who claims to be from the Consumer Association of Singapore. The scammer may know your first name and ask you to answer a few survey questions in exchange for a payment of $11.However, it's important to note that the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) does not conduct surveys in this manner. The scammers are using the name of a legitimate organization to gain your trust and trick you into providing personal information.If you receive a message like this, do not engage with the scammer.
I got matched with this guy on CMB, his name is Corn??? Tan Le? Pe?? on 26 March 2023. He say he Malaysian, but PR in SG working for Shopee Marketing for 5 years liao. We chat for 3 weeks and he always send me photos of him at atas restaurants in SG. Then, the week we supposed to meet, he say his grandpa fell down in KL and he flew back there. On the same day, he ask me to help take photos of a BTO project near my house, saying he want to invest in a private equity firm which only invites high net worth individuals. He say the head of marketing for Shopee, Winston Goh recommended him. The next day, I asked him to video call to verify his identity, but he say his phone camera spoilt. When I say I cannot help him, he angry and attack my character. Then, he decided we not contact anymore. I think he going to ask for money to invest with him and say it's only for private invitation. Be careful!
I received a voice message from HSBC Bank informing me that a transaction of $630 has been approved and will be deducted from my account. However, the issue is that I don't have an HSBC account. They also requested me to verify my account details.
Zhao Dong contacted me via Instagram on April 6, 2023, claiming he lived in Watten Park, drove a Bentley, owned a wine business, and was a divorced 41-year-old Singaporean who grew up in China. He insisted I download the Crypto.com app and transfer his coins to help me understand how cryptocurrency works, but I declined. He persisted for 15 days until he realized I wasn't interested and blocked me on WhatsApp. He refused to video conference and claimed he would meet me on his business trip to Hong Kong/China in mid-May. This is a typical pig-butchering scheme that preys on women who have a hard time saying "no" to someone who claims to love them. Unfortunately, Instagram cannot do much to block or delete such accounts, so I am sharing this as a scam alert.
I received scam calls from someone claiming to be a friend who recently changed their mobile number. They tried to chat with me as if we were old friends and kept asking me to guess their name even after I told them I didn't know who they were. The calls started with a Malaysian accent last week and a local accent this week. Please be cautious of these mobile numbers: 8103 0684, 8410 8470, 8919 4801, and +62 727 786679.
Received a voice message about a fraudulent transaction on a UOB card that didn't belong to me. Contacted UOB hotline and was informed about identity fraud.

A few days ago, a user contacted me on Instagram claiming to be new to Singapore and looking to make friends. Initially, it seemed like a harmless request, but I soon discovered that this was a sophisticated scam. The scam involved sharing bank details for fraudulent transactions involving Burberry bags, with a promise that the money would be returned to the victim with 0.5% interest. Fortunately, I did not lose any money in this scam. The scammer lured victims with promises of a meetup and then initiated the fraudulent transactions on the eve of the scheduled meeting. Additionally, the scam involved sending a WhatsApp message to a specified number to obtain the transaction code. It is important to note that this scam is targeted towards individuals who make public posts on Instagram, and the scammer typically poses as an attractive influencer looking to befriend the victim. In conclusion, it is crucial to be vigilant and cautious when interacting with strangers on social media, particularly when it involves sharing sensitive information such as bank details. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is, and it is best to err on the side of caution.
I received a Whatsapp video call from 93512754. The guy was wearing Singapore police uniform with a proper cap and name tag . HE showed a fake id. and was shouting at me in a Filipino accent for showing my ic. I just asked who you are.

I finally disconnected the cal when I realised it was a scam.

I received an automated message from 'Uob', informing me of a credit card charge of over $3k. The message asked me to press 1 to approve the charge and 0 to speak to customer service. When a live person came on the line (who spoke fluent English), he asked for my name but was unable to spell it correctly. Instead, he made up a name for me and called me 'Rebecca'. He then asked for my NRIC, which I didn't have with me as I was traveling. When I declined to disclose my personal data, he requested my passport details. However, I remained unwilling to share my personal information. When I asked for the caller's name, he said his name was Joseph Tan, with a staff ID of 118106. He repeatedly pressed me to share my personal data, stating that he was unable to verify the credit charge without it. The call lasted about 5-7 minutes, during which the caller remained courteous, patient, and did not raise his voice, which surprised me. After the call ended, I called the UOB scam hotline at 6255-0160 to verify the authenticity of the call. I confirmed that I do not have an account with UOB, have no outstanding or pending charges, and that the call from +65-9685-9676 was indeed a scam.
I received a message from WhatsApp offering a freelance job. Despite not requiring any relevant expertise, I was offered free training, and the optimization work would take place on the company's technical pages. The training process would take an hour to complete, and I would earn a profit during the training. However, clicking the "submit" button 35 times led me to an unexpected rewards bag that required payment to proceed. I lost SGD 243,298.96, including bank loans, moneylender loans, and money borrowed from friends. Despite wanting to continue to recoup my losses, I eventually ran out of funds and had to accept the loss. The stress and anxiety of the situation were compounded when someone threatened to sue me for money they had lent me as a goodwill gesture because they knew the company.

I met a guy in CMB and exchanged numbers. He claimed to work in cyber security, earning $60k per month and had a Guoco CFO mentor who introduced him to "private placement." He didn't want to meet up and got angry when I asked. He asked me to check out the BTO project "Heart of Yew Tee" and take photos for him. Later, he offered me a Tiffany necklace and an invitation code to invest in private placement. He introduced me to the investment categories, architecture and NFT, and became angry when I refused to invest. I reported and blocked him on WhatsApp.
He suggested getting to know each other by phone before meeting up. He called daily, gave me nicknames, and talked about a private equity investment opportunity. He claimed returns were guaranteed at 20-30%. However, when the face-to-face meeting was scheduled, he had to go to KL for a work emergency. He refused to video chat, claiming the company disabled his phone's photo and video functions. He then asked me to take photos of a nearby BTO project, but I declined. He got angry and accused me of being hard-hearted. Other accounts describe similar scams. The daily calls were likely a way to build trust and get me involved in the investment without ever meeting.
I received a call from a Malaysian-accented man who spoke Mandarin, claiming to be someone I knew well. He asked if I remembered him, but I didn't recognize his voice.

I received an invitation call to an Alibaba event from various Singapore numbers. A few days/weeks later, a woman named Gao Hui Ling claimed that you won a 2-carat Cartier diamond in a lucky draw. She offered two options to claim the prize - either by visiting their Hong Kong office or transferring the prize money to your bank account. I chose the second option to transfer the prize money to my bank account. Gao then requested for my bank details, full name, and identification number. Gao said that someone from the finance department would contact you to complete the process. However, I haven't answered the calls from the Hong Kong number. Please note that this is most likely a scam, and you should not share your personal information or respond to such calls/messages. It's recommended that you report the incident to the relevant authorities and block these numbers.
An Indian scammer impersonated Propnex agent Andy Ang and advertised on Carousell with the username Swetha's குடில்@ilavarasid41347 and email andy-ang@propnexrea??-sg.com. We transferred 9000 SGD before viewing 66XX Edgedale Plains unit. When we went up to the unit, the landlord informed us that there are multiple victims and a scammer has obtained the details. The scammer also verified the landlord's name in IRAS, which surprisingly matched.

I met a girl named Bei Bei (+6011 63497498) on Locanto and added her on WhatsApp. We agreed to meet at Braddell MRT, where she informed me that her boss, 阿虎, would conduct a validation call. 阿虎 claimed Bei Bei was a student who couldn't accept cash and requested an iTunes card worth $150. They demanded the full pin number and credited the amount immediately. Shortly after, 阿虎 called again, claiming I needed to pay a security deposit of another $900 in iTunes cards, which would be refunded after the service. Bei Bei sent me a photo of cash, but I refused to pay and left. They began to call, message, and threaten me and my family using different numbers (+601161338168/+601111650713), claiming to be from a gangster gang. I blocked all their numbers. Beware of girls on Locanto with +60 numbers.
I fell victim to a prepaid job scam and lost SGD 10K. I joined a Telegram group called Youtube Task Group which paid for liking YouTube videos. A person named Sukie invited me and posted 23 tasks daily, including prepaid tasks, where a cash bonus would be paid after depositing money into a merchant account. Sukie shared merchant account details and invited me to register, then asked me to contact Mike to learn about withdrawals. I completed a newcomer prepaid task and received the amount back with profit, leading me to take a SGD 352 prepaid task the next day. I was then removed from the Youtube task group and added to Mike's group with five other members. Each round, the amount needed to transfer drastically increased. I contacted Sukie and Mike and was told it was the final round, leading me to transfer SGD 5998. But then it went to a fourth round, and I did not have enough money. Sukie and Mike encouraged me to borrow, and when I refused, the group was banned, and I was unable to contact other members. I realized too late that this was a scam and missed all the red flags.

I later confirmed with my colleague that his number had not changed and agreed that it was a scam. No transfer was made, but the impersonation was convincing.
I have been receiving multiple emails from "Singtel" claiming a refund of my bill payment due to double payments. There is a link embedded in the email for you to click on. They have requested for my personal information before processing the refund.

Someone contacted me through WhatsApp claiming to be Julie from Sofitel Singapore Downtown and asked me to participate in a paid survey. After answering three survey questions, they gave me a reward code (XG09/04A02) and told me to contact their receptionist on Telegram (@sura660) to confirm my reward of S$15. On Telegram, they asked for my personal information such as my name, age, contact number, and PayNow or bank account number. However, I never received the money, and they kept delaying the process. They then sent me a link to an ecommerce site and asked me to like a product and send them a screenshot. Finally, they added me to a private Telegram group with 193 accounts, which all appeared to be fake due to their fake photos.
A girl added me on Facebook and we chatted for a few days. She mentioned that she had two jobs and asked for my help with her part-time gig as she was overwhelmed with orders. The job involved pushing sales for a product called Style Tribute, but unfortunately, the account (81707804) turned out to be fake.Initially, I received a 5% commission for my work and did a couple of transfers. However, once the amount exceeded 1k, the money never came back. The merchant then claimed there were system errors and that I needed to pay more to unfreeze the transactions and retrieve the funds. Unfortunately, this was just a ploy, and I never got the money back.When I expressed doubts, the girl, Ellie, tried to reassure me and even offered to help pay part of the required payment. However, I quickly realized that this was a scam and that I needed to be careful. So please be aware and don't fall for this trap.
While driving, I received a call from a number that appeared normal, with the digits 8456 7034. The person on the other end claimed to be Terry, a staff member from my company, and that he had lost his phone and was using a temporary number. He asked me to save his number, which I didn't do. The following day, he called again and asked for help with his POSB banking app, as the OTP had been sent to his old number. I advised him on what to do, but later he said he had made a mistake and his account was now locked. He claimed to have a meeting with his team manager and needed my help to transfer money to a supplier, promising to pay me back once he had sorted out his account at the bank. He sounded and spoke like a Chinese Malaysian staff member in my company, which made me trust him. I transferred money to the number he gave me, but then he asked for more money the next day, which made me suspicious. I called the staff member's old number, and while it rang, no one picked up. When I called the new number, the person claimed to have been trying to contact the old number without success. I believed his story and transferred more money. Within five minutes, the real Terry called me and told me he hadn't lost his phone and hadn't spoken to me since last week. I realized I had been scammed and called the bank, but it was too late. The bank couldn't stop the transactions because I had used PayNow. I lost a total of $2000 within three days, starting from 4/4/2023. Despite considering myself a careful person, I let my guard down because the scammer knew certain details and names from my company. Please be vigilant and avoid falling victim to such scams.
The scammer pretended to be a friend who had changed their number and opened the call by asking me to guess who he was. I didn't recognize his voice, so I asked him to tell me instead. After several unsuccessful attempts at guessing, he finally revealed his name as Alan. However, I didn't recall having a friend by that name whose voice matched his. When I asked for his old number, he couldn't provide it and said he would text me later before hanging up. His Malaysian accent became more prominent during the call, which raised my suspicion. Notably, the scammer's number did not have the prefix +65.

I received a call from a scammer who used my exact first name and pretended to be a friend who had recently changed his number. The person asked me to guess who he was, but I couldn't recognize his voice due to his Malaysian accent. When I asked him to tell me his name, he taunted me for not being able to guess correctly and even commented on my sounding "blur" (confused). This angered me, so I shut him up by saying that I had to attend a meeting. He then said that he would text me later.Feeling suspicious about the call, I added the number to my contacts and messaged the person on WhatsApp to ask who he was. However, he read my message but didn't reply. This frustrated me, and I ended the call and blocked the number. Later, while searching for similar cases online, I came across a website that confirmed my suspicions of a potential scam.It's worth noting that the scammer's number didn't come with a +65, and when I used the True Caller app to trace it, I found out that it was an M1 line. I'm not sure how accurate the mobile carrier information is, but it's still a cause for concern.In conclusion, it's crucial to be vigilant when receiving calls or messages from unknown numbers, especially when they ask for personal information or try to pressure you into doing something. Pls stay informed in order to avoid getting scammed in the future.

This raised suspicion for me as I don't have close friends with a KL/Malaysian accent. The scammer's number did not have the prefix +65, and they were skilled at maintaining a casual tone while phishing for information. I eventually refused to answer and hung up.

They cancelled my cards and online banking, but no unusual transactions were detected. This occurred on April 2, 2023.
If you receive a call from a person claiming to be from OCBC and speaking in Mandarin, be wary. One number to look out for is 85554656, which scammers have been using to pretend to be from OCBC. It's important to stay vigilant, as these callers may try to get personal information from you. In the event that you do receive such a call, it's best to hang up immediately and not engage with the caller. Remember, OCBC communicates in English, so if someone is speaking in Mandarin, it's likely a scam.
I met someone on the Bumble dating app, and we moved our conversation to WhatsApp. He sent me a video of him deleting the dating app and claimed he was sincere about a relationship. He called me the next day, shared photos of food, and flaunted his wealth by mentioning his condo and car. He repeatedly brought up a private placement investment opportunity he received from the CFO of "Guoco Group". When he said he needed to go to Kuala Lumpur for work, he asked me to take photos of a BTO project for him. When I declined, he became angry.

I was in need of urgent financial assistance and decided to search online for a license lending company.

Eventually, he convinced me that this was part of the company's terms and that I needed to send the additional $300. He then passed me to another individual named Aka Chris Chen/Darren Tan and asked me to send an invoice to Aka.Aka then requested that I send $500 to activate my account and receive my loan.

On March 30, 2023, at 2:15 PM, I received a video call on WhatsApp from an individual dressed in full police uniform, complete with cap and mask. The man appeared to be in his 20s and was standing under a police sign. He requested that I show him a copy of my NRIC before continuing the call. However, I became skeptical and asked for his identity and the reason for the request. Since he could not provide me with satisfactory answers, I promptly ended the call and advised him to contact me through official channels.It is important to note that this individual appeared genuine and serious, which is why I feel it is necessary to share this experience and warn others, especially young and senior citizens, of potential scams. We must all remain vigilant and cautious to protect ourselves from such fraudulent activities.

Beware of articles advertising an investment scheme called Immediate Edge. One such article, dated March 23, 2023, featured Mr. K Shanmugam endorsing this crypto auto-trading program. I suspect the article is fake, and a similar one featuring Stefanie Sun has also surfaced recently. Despite researching online reviews, I remain unconvinced of Immediate Edge's legitimacy. Please exercise caution. Scam article link: https://timebusinessnews.com/k-shanmugam-immediate-edge-review-scam-or-legit/

I suggested calling the bank hotline or visiting the bank directly, but the caller hung up abruptly.Interestingly, I received another strange call from 81913865 just an hour before the "uncle" call. A lady with a strong Malaysian accent claimed to be my friend. It's worth noting the similar accents in both calls.
My helper responded to a Facebook ad for a loan and was directed to a WhatsApp number. She was asked to provide personal information, including her employer's name and contact number, a picture of her work permit, and a letter with our residential address. After rejecting the loan, the money lenders transferred $200 into her bank account without her knowledge. A week later, they demanded $1500 from both of our contacts and sent threatening messages, including threats to burn and lock down our house.

I received a cold call, which was an automated message informing me that I had a $3200 charge on my UOB credit card ending with -####. The message instructed me to press 1 to approve the charge. However, I did not continue the call because I do not have a UOB credit card. If I did, I might have been led to find out more.

Survey paynow me $5 from Ref 583409? "Jacky W. D. Silva on 21 march 2023. Then started to ask me to join Telegram.
I received an email on 20 March 2023 from my own email account (full content below). Apparently, that person claims that he/she has taken over full control of my computer device and E-mail account and attempted to extort money from me. he/she claimed that with the help of trojan virus, he/she could activate my computer camera and microphone without me noticing and uses that as a threat to expose videos of me if I do not deposit bitcoins into his wallet. Full email below: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello! Have you recently noticed that I have e-mailed you from your account? Yes, this simply means that I have total access to your device. For the last couple of months, I have been watching you. Still wondering how is that possible? Well, you have been infected with malware originating from an adult website that you visited. You may not be familiar with this, but I will try explaining it to you. With help of the Trojan Virus, I have complete access to a PC or any other device. This simply means I can see you at any time I wish to on your screen by simply turning on your camera and microphone, without you even noticing it. In addition, I have also got access to your contacts list and all your correspondence. You may be asking yourself, "But my PC has an active antivirus, how is this even possible? Why didn't I receive any notification?" Well, the answer is simple: my malware uses drivers, where I update the signatures every four hours, making it undetectable, and hence keeping your antivirus silent. I have a video of you wanking on the left screen, and on the right screen - the video you were watching while masturbating. Wondering how bad could this get? With just a single click of my mouse, this video can be sent to all your social networks, and e-mail contacts. I can also share access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use. All you have to do to prevent this from happening is - transfer bitcoins worth $1450 (USD) to my Bitcoin address (if you have no idea how to do this, you can open your browser and simply search: "Buy Bitcoin"). My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is: 18cZdbWnhjRcUPGZgjRgsXFzLDwYHX7EuA After receiving a confirmation of your payment, I will delete the video right away, and that's it, you will never hear from me again. You have 2 days (48 hours) to complete this transaction. Once you open this e-mail, I will receive a notification, and my timer will start ticking. Any attempt to file a complaint will not result in anything, since this e-mail cannot be traced back, same as my bitcoin id. I have been working on this for a very long time by now; I do not give any chance for a mistake. If, by any chance I find out that you have shared this message with anybody else, I will broadcast your video as mentioned above.
A "Anita" added me on WhatsApp and asked me to pretend to purchase an LV product, to create a sales record.

Request to befriend user @alex_wong810 on Instagram and ask for his WhatsApp number, which is +1 (418) 210-3506. He claimed to be a 45-year-old petroleum engineer from Hong Kong working in Atlanta, Georgia, with a work schedule of Monday to Saturday from 9 am to 6 pm, commuting to work by car. Initially, the conversation started with a simple greeting, but within a week, he professed love. Despite the unrealistic nature of his behavior, communication continued. However, upon closer inspection, it was evident that his story did not add up - the location of Atlanta was not near any sea, and the temperature and weather were incorrect, along with the time zone differences. Additionally, several Instagram accounts using the same profile picture as @alex_wong810 were discovered, including @alex_wong26, @alextan01_wong, and @alex10.wong. Consequently, I blocked and reported the user to Instagram, but some of the accounts remain active.
On March 16, 2023, I received a part-time job offer from an individual named Chao Yan, who claimed to be from Malaysia and contacted me using the phone number +60 1128986851. After expressing interest, Chao Yan referred me to her colleague, Jacky, who further elaborated on the job offer. Jacky stated that the basic salary for the job was $2,800 per month with a requirement to complete three sets per day for seven days, earning $700 SGD every week. He also claimed that I could earn $4,000 to $5,000 per month if I had better abilities and that finishing one set could earn me around $60 to $250 SGD.On March 18, Jacky provided me with a website link, "poegrowrasia.com," and claimed that he was from the advertising company, Popper Asia. However, after checking the website on Scamadvisor.com, it was reported to be a scam, and the scammer was posing as Popper Asia. The website's registration page required personal information such as my phone number, email address, and date of birth. When I asked for his company's name and registration number, Jacky responded that he was from "Popperasia ah," and his English was poor. Additionally, the website images he sent had grammar mistakes. I am 99% certain that this is a scam, and I did not register an account with them.Please be cautious and aware of such fraudulent job offers.
The scammer instructs you to register for a portal and promote 40 brands in a set by clicking on a play button. You are promised 1% of the value shown there, which at the start, would be around $1 per play or $40 for 40 plays. They will ask you to do this initially in a training account, and you do not have to pay there. However, in your actual account, if the amount shown for a brand is greater than your balance, you will be asked to pay. Their support team appears to be very responsive, but you risk losing all your money when you are unable to pay them. Unfortunately, you can only withdraw earnings after reviewing 40 brands, so if you are asked to pay $6,000 or $7,000, you won't be able to continue. And whatever you have already paid will be lost.Please beware of such scams.
A scammer may call and claim to be a friend of yours. They might not be able to answer when you ask who they are, but they will try to get you to provide a name. They will then say that they lost their phone and need to update you on their new number.Later, they may call again, possibly on a Saturday, and ask how to change their phone banking number. Since it's a half day of banking, you might tell them they need to wait until the next workday.The scammer might then request that you urgently help them pay a contractor, which you should not agree to do. Please be cautious when receiving such calls.
Please avoid responding to any random paid surveys in WhatsApp, including those related to food delivery, weather, or tourist attractions. Unfortunately, I fell victim to one of these surveys in February 2023 without much thought, and after receiving $6 via PayNow, I was led to add someone on Telegram to carry out what others had also fallen prey to. The job tasks required me to like TikTok or YouTube videos for payment per task, and group tasks came along that required me to transfer more and more funds to get returns. Halfway through the tasks, by clicking on a dubious crypto website they created, they claimed that someone made a mistake when carrying out the tasks and needed to transfer more funds. When I finally had no money to transfer, they claimed that since I could not complete the tasks, the "mission" failed, and I could not withdraw the funds. They used my fear of losing all my transferred funds and forced me to try to get more money so that I could "withdraw" my funds "successfully."This is a blood-sucking scam, and I hope everyone can avoid any random paid WhatsApp surveys that may lead to great monetary losses. I have made a police report and informed my bank.

I received a call from a scammer who spoke with a Malaysian-accented Chinese and knew my name. He claimed he had a new number and pretended to be a friend I had forgotten. After a few exchanges, he said his name was "Xiao Win," but I had no recollection of him. He abruptly hung up after that.

In January 2023, an online friend invited me to invest in Loboex. After investing, I attempted to withdraw money in early March but the withdrawal was refused. Upon contacting Loboex's online customer service, I learned that my account was frozen due to a supposed violation of trade rules. They demanded that I deposit USD $3 million for capital verification in order to withdraw. This is when I realized it was a scam. When I asked for specifics about the rules I had violated, they only urged me to pay the capital verification and threatened to freeze my account permanently by the end of March.
Received a WhatsApp message from Alexis who offered a survey on Singapore malls.

Attempted the third task with a higher amount, but they asked for larger sums of money, up to SGD15,888, claiming someone had not followed instructions. Tried to quit, but was told it was a group task and could not get a refund. Suspecting a scam, contacted the bank and filed a police report without transferring the funds.

When I attempted to call the number back five minutes later, the call did not go through. Please be cautious of similar calls.

I lost all of my savings, $37k SGD, to a job scam. I received a message on WhatsApp offering an online job working from home to help optimize app ratings and improve app data. They claimed it was a flexible side hustle with a basic salary of $2000 a month and 1% profit on optimized apps, with potential to earn up to $3500 a month. The scammers asked me to register on a portal and do training before depositing $280 SGD to start working. Once I deposited the money, the scammers added me to a WhatsApp group and gained my trust. Please be aware of this scam and do not fall for it like I did.
I received a Facebook ad from someone claiming to be from the cleaning company Mop Squad. They provided a contact number on Facebook Messenger, but when I messaged them on WhatsApp, I became suspicious. They offered a deal that seemed too good to be true - 4 hours of cleaning, 4 times a week for $200. They asked for my personal address and $5 as a down payment. I tried to fill out a form, but it was difficult and I eventually ignored the request.Three days later, they messaged me again, asking me to download an app called HUSTORE, which was not available on Google Play. I searched for information on this and found that it was a cleaning services scam. Please be careful when dealing with unknown cleaning services. Editor's note: Please do not download apps outside of legitimate app stores. Watch this video for more info: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T527Ru9AN0s
Yesterday morning, I received a call from 9193260?, who claimed to be my friend that had lost their phone and requested me to use this number. Today, the same person messaged me again saying that it affected their bank account and they urgently needed money to pay their supplier. Luckily, I emailed my friend to confirm, and he called me back to clarify that he didn't make the call.
On March 10th, 2023, I received a missed call from a number (85436080) and decided to call back. The person on the other end informed me that he had lost his phone in Malaysia and obtained my number from his Gmail account. He asked me if I knew him, and I confirmed that he sounded like my friend Clifford. He then asked me to update his number in my contacts and even sent me a WhatsApp message to remind me.Later that day, he called me again and asked for help with updating his contact number in his internet banking account. I walked him through the process, but he still struggled to do it himself. He also asked me to transfer money to his contractor, promising to repay me on Monday, March 13th.He called again on March 11th, asking me to transfer another sum of money to the same contractor. I agreed and used another bank to transfer the money, taking a screenshot and sending it to him.Unfortunately, on March 12th, UOB bank contacted me to inform me that the PayNow number was linked to a highly reported scam case, and that my accounts and cards would be frozen. When I messaged my friend using his old number, he denied ever calling me. It was too late; I had fallen for a scam.
An unknown caller impersonated as an old friend, and accused me of not remembering her. Then, in subsequent phone calls, she started asking for help such as helping her to reset her bank account, then proceeded to ask for a loan.
I received three calls in the past 1.5 weeks from numbers with the +1 prefix. When I picked up, an automated message played midway, and I was asked to choose between English or Chinese by pressing '0' or '1.' Despite choosing English, a man answered in Chinese and asked what matter I wanted to address. When I asked him to speak in English, he claimed that the service was only available in Chinese. As I tried to find out more about the call, the man abruptly hung up on me.The three numbers that called me were +1 675815817806, +1 965700137396, and +1 665816541912. This is concerning, as it appears to be a recurring pattern with different numbers. It's important to remain cautious and not engage with unknown callers, especially those who ask for personal information or money.
Robocall: "There is problem with your ICA details. press '3'to speak to our officer.'
In February 2023, I met a man named Lin Yang on the dating app CMB. He claimed to be Taiwanese and the owner of an architecture firm. We conversed in Mandarin and eventually moved to WhatsApp. Within two weeks, he began teaching me about investing with Franklin Templeton. However, I was overseas at the time, and he became very impatient. When I returned, he urged me to invest 1,000 dollars, promising a return of 10-15% and the ability to cash out the winnings the next day.As time went on, he claimed that due to unstable data, we had to top up more funds. Eventually, the funds became unwithdrawable, and he demanded that I top up more money in order to transact and withdraw. He also purchased flowers for me before we even met, but refused to take any video calls, citing a bad experience with a previous girlfriend.I want to warn others about my experience with Lin Yang and his investment scheme, which turned out to be a scam. Don't trust anyone who pressures you into investing money or refuses to show their face on a video call. Be careful and always do your research before making any investments.
Received a call from the number, 8115 4738 without +65, claiming to be from ICA and requesting me to enter 3 to connect to an officer. Upon connecting to an “officer”, who speaks in a Chinese accent, asking me my purpose of calling in. Upon me responding that they were the one who called in, the “officer” immediately hung up the call. Tried calling back to the number, but it is a one way number. Suspect that this is a number used for spoofing and they are using call routing services to appear legitimate and trick people into thinking it's a genuine call as the number is without +65
I fell for a scam when I joined a Telegram group called Reception Grace. They assigned me a mission to like and follow a TikTok account, promising to send me a commission once completed. I earned around $40 in less than 3 minutes, which seemed too good to be true. They then asked me to join another group run by Reception Jenny Chong and a mentor named Andy Tan. They gave me tasks to boost popularity on Shopee, but later told me I needed to transfer them a huge amount of money to proceed with the withdrawal. I foolishly transferred the money, only to be asked for more to complete the next task. I learned the hard way that there is no free lunch or easy money. Don't fall for these scams.
Yesterday, I received a call from someone who claimed to be a colleague of mine. He told me that he lost his bag but managed to get my number, and he even addressed me by my name. I believed him and trusted that he was my colleague. Today, around lunchtime, he called me again and asked me to loan him $2.3k to pay his contractor. He provided me with a name and number for me to transfer the money to, which I did without hesitation using PayNow. Luckily, the transaction didn't go through. Later, a DBS bank officer called and informed me that the number I transferred to was a scam number. I was shocked and asked him to cancel the transaction. I'm sharing this story to raise awareness and warn others to be careful of these two mobile numbers - 90796344 and 85806279 - and avoid becoming a scam victim. I've also reported the incident through the ScamShield app. Remember to be cautious and verify the authenticity of any requests for money, even if the person claims to be someone you know.

I got a call just now from someone who knew my name and said that he was my ex-client William. As I cannot remember of an ex-client named William, I asked him things like which company Is he from and how i got to know him. He kept giving me answers like "you guess" and "Wah, you forgot who i am ar?". i then asked him how he got my number as i did not have this number when i was working in that industry, he said that he got it from his previous phone which does not make sense. since i was with 2 companies during my time working in that industry, i asked him which company was i with and he said yes to both. i was pretty sure it was a scam call by then and tried to get more information out of him. he finally said he will whatsapp me and I can see who he is from the photo but of course the whatsapp did not come. I am writing this just to warn people about what has happened and to share the number I got which is 85568529. Thanks.

I received a WhatsApp message from an overseas number (+1) addressing me by my name. When I asked who the person was, she immediately replied, claiming to be someone from GrabFood marketing and asked if I could complete a survey.

A person added me on Instagram and we chatted for a while before they requested that we move our conversation to WhatsApp. However, I had a suspicion that this individual was a scammer, so I decided to play along to confirm my suspicions.For the first few days, our conversations were casual, which is a common tactic used by scammers to build relationships with their victims. But then the individual told me about their "part-time job," and that's when I knew for sure that they were a scammer. The job involved helping luxury brands boost their sales by assisting merchants in purchasing products. The merchants would then return the original amount paid, along with interest.Curious about their tactics, I decided to continue playing along. Last Friday, the scammer texted me and asked for my help in processing orders so that they didn't have to stay up late to complete their "part-time job." I followed their instructions up until the payment stage, and then I stopped responding to them. The scammer then attempted to WhatsApp call me a few times, but I ignored the calls. After that, I didn't hear from them again.In conclusion, I was able to confirm my suspicions that the person who added me on Instagram was indeed a scammer, and I was able to prevent myself from falling victim to their fraudulent scheme.
Two scammers claiming to be Singtel technicians called me, saying that my WiFi had been hacked and used for illegal activities. They asked me to download an executable file after entering a security code on a webpage called mPkpk.info.

They gave up and said they would contact me later.
Received a call at 12:30 pm today. The caller knew my name and claimed to be an old best friend. He spoke in Chinese, but was not very clear. When I asked for his name, he did not give it. When I insisted that he had the wrong number, he quickly hung up.

The police then asked for personal details and the case number and requested further verification using WhatsApp. Please do not be fooled into giving out any personal information, including card details.
A girl added me on Facebook and asked for my WhatsApp contact. We started talking and after a few days, she asked me to help her with a task for her second job. She said the job was to help merchants boost their sales using courts.sg. I suspected it was a scam and asked for guidance, but she paid $109 to the merchant and asked me to use my account to receive the payment.She then told me to sign up for PayNow and set a daily limit of $20,000. I realized it was a scam and started avoiding her messages. She continued to harass me with different phone numbers, including 8546 65??, 8171 21??, 8212 76??, 8609 66??, 8935 38??, and 9348 02??.I suggest being cautious of these people as their chat style and words used are similar. If you receive similar messages, please report them to the relevant authorities.
I met a guy on OKC who introduced himself as an employee at Garena. At first, he seemed nice, sharing pictures of what he ate and did, but he never showed his face. He called me daily to chat and eventually started hinting at a scheme he wanted me to join in on. He invited me to KL on a work trip to inspect a "bto project" he wanted to participate in. Out of kindness, I helped him take pictures of the site. He then used the pictures to "apply" for a slot for me at a fake "government private crowdfunding" app by SEA Online.Without knowing it was fake, I installed the app and followed his instructions. The first time, I received my money back, but the app seemed suspicious, so I searched online and discovered that such scams exist.When I confronted him, he became angry and started to scold me. Please be careful! I believe that if I had fallen for the scam a second time, my money would not have been returned.
I received a WhatsApp message from someone named SONIA claiming to be from EXPATARRIVALS.COM, offering me $6 to complete a three-question survey.

I came across a story on scamalert.sg that described a similar situation, confirming my suspicion that this was a scam. I immediately blocked both users and want to thank scamalert.sg for sharing their story and warning others about this type of scam. Please be cautious and don't fall for these types of offers.
On March 1st, I received a call from someone claiming to be a long-time friend, but he never mentioned his name. He said he had lost his phone and wallet and was using a new phone number. He mentioned that he had opened a cafe and invited me to the opening ceremony.On March 2nd, he called again and mentioned that his bank account was frozen and he needed money to pay a supplier. He promised to return the money by 3 pm in the afternoon after his bank released his funds. He asked for a bridging loan to pay the supplier, who had just made a delivery. He provided a Standard Chartered account belonging to a Tan Gu?? W?? with the account number 0127847?? for me to transfer the money.However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the transfer was not successful. He called again on March 3rd, asking for the bridging loan.

Recently, I received a phone call from an unidentified number, and the scammer on the other end of the line started the conversation by introducing himself with a new mobile number. He then proceeded to ask me if I could remember who he was. When I informed him that I couldn't recognize his voice, he kept insisting that I try to recall who he was. This went on for about two minutes until the scammer finally said that he would call me back later. To my surprise, my spouse had a similar encounter with the same scammer. It is worth noting that the scammer knew both our names, which is concerning. This is a common tactic used by scammers to gain people's trust, and once they have established a rapport, they may try to scam their victims out of money or sensitive information. It is important to be vigilant and cautious when receiving calls from unfamiliar numbers and not disclose personal information to strangers. If you suspect that you have been targeted by a scammer, report it to the relevant authorities immediately.
I recently received a phone call from a local handphone number, but to my surprise, the person on the other end spoke with a male Malaysian Chinese accent. He referred to me by name and informed me that he had changed his number. However, when I asked him to identify himself, he evaded the question and kept insisting that I should know who he was. The conversation went on for a few minutes until he abruptly ended it by saying that he would message me on WhatsApp, which never happened. Upon reflection, it appears that the caller was attempting to lure me into revealing the name of someone I know, potentially to scam me out of money.

The caller attempted to pressure me, but eventually hung up when he realized that I did not believe him.

He claimed to be from DBS, Marina Bay branch and said that he needed to verify some details for an enquiry that I had supposedly made. However, I was suspicious because I had not made any enquiry with DBS and no bank officer had ever spoken to me in Mandarin.

When I refused to provide any information and hung up, I called the DBS hotline to verify the call and was informed that there was no record of such calls.

Email as below appeared. Mrs Maria has a donation of $3.5M for you and your family contact her with this email:mariafrancafissolo47@hotmail.com for more explanation. Editor's note: Be cautious of unsolicited emails that claim to offer large sums of money, especially if the sender is not known to you. Scammers often use these tactics to trick people into providing personal information or sending money. It is best to ignore and delete such emails, and never provide personal or financial information to unknown people.
Be cautious when selling items on Facebook Marketplace. Scammers may approach you with similar tactics, such as not bargaining on price, asking someone else to pick up the item on their behalf, and insisting on paying upfront via digital payment methods. If you feel uncomfortable with the transaction, it's best to insist on transacting in person. If the buyer disappears or stops responding, it's likely a scam.

BLOCK NUMBERS 18006079419, 18007976358, 18006079419 Step 1- automated message that informed me of a pending transaction on my uob credit card ( press 1 to approve, 2 to speak to a customer service officer) Step 2- if you press 2, an "officer" by the name of Wesley Tan (Staff ID 249964) gives you an elaborately laid out case...Transaction of more than 4000 SGD on SHOPPEE on credit card under your name ( pls confirm your name and IC) and when I informed him I don't even have a UOB credit card, he proceeded to share the date of application, branch ( Tampines) and that it was issued yesterday. Even shared the "fake" address of the alleged fraudster and then since this is Identity theft and fraud, he proceeded to connect me to a police officer. STEP 3- Transferred the call to a "CID" police Officer who claimed to be working from the Cantonment building. He was extremely stern and was scolding me about not using my IC responsibly. and giving a copy to third parties. Asked me all the information again, what got me though was his insistence that I am in a quiet room without any "third party". I told him I will have lunch and will come in person to report the details. He did not miss a beat and told me his name was lee Weiming and to come look for him at the police station. In which world do bank reps transfer calls to CID police officers!
I received a text message from someone claiming to be Janice from Tribal Fusion, stating that they had a job recommendation for me. The message instructed me to use Telegram and search for EuniceK01. When I contacted Eunice, who claimed to be a supervisor at Tribal Fusion Pte Ltd, she explained that the job was to generate Agoda hotel reservations in order to boost their ratings. She promised that once the 7-14 day trial was over, I would be paid $4,000 as a regular employee. During the first day of the trial, I would receive commission based on the hotel rates, and for a whole day booking, I could earn about $70-$80. On the second day, they offered a travel agency booking with 7% commission, promising that I would receive the commission after paying for the booking in full. Unfortunately, this was a scam.Once I transferred my money to them, they stopped responding to my messages. The group chat where they had promised to provide me with screenshots of successful transfers turned out to be full of fake profiles and fake screenshots. I realized that it was too late, and that I had fallen prey to these fraudsters.I have filed a police report. This experience has taught me that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Please be vigilant and never send money to anyone you don't know and trust.

My mother received a call on her landline from a scammer claiming to be a technical staff from Singtel technical department. He said that Singtel's back-end servers detected a malicious application on my mother's laptop and offered to show her how to remove it. To do so, he instructed my mother to download the TeamViewer app and give him access to her laptop. Thankfully, my mother was slightly suspicious and handed the phone to me.I asked the scammer for his office number and told him that I would call Singtel directly to verify whether such services existed and whether they were legitimate. He repeatedly insisted on using the TeamViewer method and even tried to instill urgency by saying things like "do we want to solve this internet malicious software, or if not, I can end the call now." But the more he insisted, the more convinced I became that it was a scam. After refusing several times, he hung up.I reported the incident to Singtel, and they confirmed that everything was okay with my internet and that Singtel would not initiate any technical support. Instead, Singtel offers on-demand technical support, meaning that customers must initiate any technical support when they face issues. This confirmed that it was indeed a scam attempt.I want to caution everyone to be aware of such scams and never give access to their computers to someone they don't know or trust. Always verify with the company directly before giving any sensitive information or downloading any unknown apps. If you encounter such scams, please report them to the relevant authorities immediately.
I received a message on WhatsApp about a commission-based job to increase exposure for a hotel through the company Tribal Fusion Singapore Pte Ltd. The job involves working with Agoda Booking Europe and offers both prepaid and commission-based work. The company will pay you via PayNow at the beginning of the job. However, if you opt for the prepaid job, the amount involved is more, and the company's members assure that it's normal and that they always receive their money back.Initially, I felt comfortable with the job as many people were doing it and had shared screenshots of proof of payment. However, after my fourth transfer, I started feeling uneasy. Unfortunately, I didn't listen to my instincts and transferred my last payment. Now, I feel regretful and sad as I am jobless, and all my savings have disappeared within a day.I haven't shared this with my family as I don't want to worry them, and I don't know how to recover my money. I want to caution others to be careful when considering job offers that promise high payouts with little effort.

I received a call from the number +1 (800) 742-3904, claiming to approve a credit card transaction for the METRO UOB VISA CREDIT CARD with the number 4265 6900 8654 1183 for $4,839. However, I do not have a UOB account, which made me suspicious of the call.The caller transferred me to a "UOB operator" who claimed that my account was applied for at the UOB Tampines Branch on February 6th, 2023 at 1:58 PM, which was not true. The operator asked for my name and IC for verification, which he claimed matched the details registered under the account, including an address at 'BLK 8 FRENCH ROAD #04-26' and an email address at 'IRENE391@GMAIL.COM'.The operator then advised me to transfer the call to the Cantonment police station as it was a misuse of identity. While the operator was providing me with the details, I stumbled upon a post on https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-05Jan2023163454PM, which confirmed that this was a scam. The caller hung up after.I immediately contacted UOB, and they confirmed that this was indeed a scam, and the card number provided was invalid. I had no account with them.I want to caution others to be careful of such scam calls and to be wary of providing personal information over the phone. It is important to verify the caller's identity and the legitimacy of the request before sharing any information. Please stay vigilant and report any suspicious calls to the relevant authorities.

On February 15th, 2023, a scammer impersonated my contractor, Mr Wong, and called me to inform me that he had changed his phone number. The scammer then asked me to update his new phone number in my records. I complied with the request.The following morning, the scammer called me again and asked for my One-Time Password (OTP).

I was recently approached by a friend who claimed to have invested and received a return of $10,000. Without realizing the risks, I went ahead with the investment and my friend referred me to an Instagram account called alexsis kartina. The account holder instructed me to use a third-party platform called Trust Wallet and asked me to transfer $100 USD and 150 MYR through the app using SIMPLEX company. However, when I tried to withdraw the funds, my Instagram account was hacked and taken over by the scammer. The scammer falsely claimed that I had invested over $500 and received a return of $10,000. As a result of this scam, I lost a total of SDG $180.This incident occurred on February 15th, 2023. I am sharing my story to raise awareness about the risks of online scams and to caution others to be more vigilant when investing online.

Once you add them , the receptionist will add you to a group and there will be mission given every 25mins from 10am to 10pm. every mission will earn $4 and the mission is just like &amp; screenshot the YouTube video link given. in the mid there will be a prepaid task that you have to select the quota to earn commission. you will have to prepaid the amount and the merchant will refund back with the commission within 10 mins when u complete the task. when you accept the task they will give u a link to create an account. you will be ask to exit the group chat in case of data leak. at the point i kinda knew it was a scam. but decide to just follow through to see how. hence i took the smallest task amount of $59. and transfer the amount to the account given. after which i create the account on the website and follow the steps given. once done you will need to enter your bank account number and withdraw the funds. thankfully i was able to still get back the amount. and after looking though online on such scam i confirm if i were to be greedy i will fall in the scam. Hence, please besure not to fall for such scam. but now i am unsure what will happen since they have my account number.
This was just like an encounter shared on ScamAlert. The call was from a number +1-800-222-4011. It was an automated message which stated that there is a pending transaction on my credit card with UOB. Press 1 to approve and press 2 to speak with a customer service officer. I pressed 2. A man took the line who sounded very much a polite Singaporean who sounded much to be a customer service officer. He stated that there was a uob credit card transaction under my name, and since this was the first transaction under this credit card exceeding sgd 4,000/-, they are calling just in case. He told me to disclose my name and fin number, which i did. He very much explained in detail the nature of the credit card (when it was applied, which UOB branch it was applied), and what kind of trasaction was made and amount. He then told me that he will transfer this call to the police so i can register a request for a police report. Call was transfered to what claimed to be the police, and i had repeated the information given by the uob operator for police report. but at the same time, I was beginning to feel super suspecious of what was going on, so i googled "uob scam", and came to the ABOVE-MENTIONED article, wow this is just it!! on the other hand, the police officer requested me to isolate myself from other individual as the police recording is set to record only him and myself. At that time i very much noticed that i was scammed, so i hung up.
I got a call for transaction approval thru my credit card. To verify account, scammer asked me name and fin no. I mistakenly shared my info. Later scammer continued fake stories about transactions, Advice to make police report. after I shared my fin no., I realize I got scammed. I told him that I will go to bank personally. he keep saying to find him immediately at UOB headquarters.
Recorder call said I have a transfer of $4,000+ pending, press 1 to approve or 0 to speak with a bank officer. I selected 0 &amp; asked the "office" how i could be sure this was a genuine call from uob. she said i could go to my branch. I said i don't have time. she gave me a supposed staff number and asked me to call the bank hotline. I used the uob chat service who assured me it was not a genuine call. the staff number given on the call was 175688. i did not give any information, not even my name
The scammer first contacted me the evening before. he started with " do you know who i am?", as he sounded alike my friend i unknowingly gave out my friend's name (wei ming). he then went along with it and say that he lost his phone and to change to this number. this was a clear sign of social engineering. The next day, he called me and asked me if i know how to change the official contact in the POSB app as he had to make some payment for some renovation at home. he sent me a few pictures and i instructed him to click on change particular. 5 mins later, he called back and said he couldn't change the number as he forgot the answers to his security questions. He then asked if i could pay for him first, and he would pay me back. feeling suspicious as i know this friend quite well knowing he stays with multiple roommates, i said i had no money. he was easy-going and said ok before hanging up. I immediately reported and blocked his number on WhatsApp. fortunately, not losing any money.
hi Police, We are writing in to raise awareness on the recent travel scam in which unforuntaley we have fallen prey to. After googling for ktx trains ticket from seoul to busan, we made an online purchase with this website "rail.ninja/route.com" which was unfortunaly found to be fradulent. [similar incidents were shared by the members of the public. article with asiaone / straits time] We paid usd $154.89 which was equivalent to SGD211.35 with our bank credit cards details. our nightmare ensued after my paypal account that was tied to this credit card had "two" unauthorised deductions to Europe rail way service "paypal italoreno 89" for the amount of sgd120.51 and sgd84.31. these two fradulents deduction was reported to paypal and i have received the refunds. from 1 feb to 12 feb, we did not receive any link to reserve our seats. that triggers an alarm and we went online to do more research on this rail ninja which was then confirmed to be a fradulent website with many victims. the website is well run by the syndicate with deceptive modus operandi. website was well maintained. they have an actual customer serivce email that responsed saying they need more time to provide the link for us to reserve our seats. all this was a complete lie as we did not hear from them anymore. Please purchase tickets using legitimate platforms.
I came across a job advertisement on Facebook about the florist named "coco flower 香皂花" looking for online admin to help them to handle business as they are expanding their business to Singapore. The lady called "may" mentioned that they are from "homepro pte ltd" and coco flower is their partner whereby they are helping to take the order and submit into their system. i will only need to spend 1 to 2 hrs per day and need to finish the work by 9.30pm. I even checked on their company using the UEN ID(202137527R) given. after everything seems pretty legit, so i decided to proceed. She asked me to try using her account first instead of using my own account. this is how it works, i had to grab 60 orders before i can withdraw the profit and commission. sometimes i will need to top up the account using my own money by contacting their customer service. the amount that i need to top up is getting bigger and bigger. i told may that i don't have that much money and she said she can borrow me. i thought she was nice and should not be a scammer since she is willing to lend me. when i was at 59th order, i was asked to top up 8k+ and i told may that i don't have that much. so i decided to stop as i'm worried that i couldn't get back my money. but may asked me to contact customer service to hold the account balance to next day so that i have time to borrow money elsewhere, but i told her that i decided to stop. i still feel sorry to may at first as i think she is trying to help me. i deleted all the conversations as i don't want to let my husband to find out. but in the end, i shared to my husband and he told me that this is scam. i called bank to reverse all the transaction and they mentioned this is a scam as well. Please beware of the job that is high paid with few hours of work, this is totally a job scam!
A guy speaking in mandarin call out to my name to inform me that he just changed his number. Next thing, I asked him who he was, he keep saying i forget him, that we have talk on phone recently (which i dont remember i did recently) and he asked is whether i know who he is. I keep prompting and asked him who he is, but he keep dilly dally dont want to admit who he is. He then said he would text me after the call and I so I ended the call. That was obviously a scam call!

DO NOT SHARE YOUR OTP. IT all started a few days ago, when an instagram account followed me, he had mutual followers with me, he wanted to be friends with me after following him back. A day later, he asked me for help to recover his account. I immediately jumped in to help. he wanted to recover his "account" using my account. when I asked him what account he wanted to recover, he didn't answer it at all. i somehow managed to recover the account. however a few hours later i got locked out again, the scammer had details to my login account for my instagram and my facebook account. He then asked me to send him a steam card and a $100 app store &amp; Itunes card. i immediately stopped contacting him after i realised i had been lured by him to give my OTP to recover his so called "account". Remember, NEVER EVER give your OTP to anyone, ever!
The scammer used a fake profile name "Andy chen", after i blocked him from whatsapp, he went to an extent to use a different number to chat with me. In addition, he acted pathetic, telling me to get back with him and he really like me. Once you reject him, he change tactic ask you to create a cmb account for him. He mentioned he will send those pics and details required for cmb account creation. All i need is to maintain the account, get hook up with other ladies to ask for their contact, and he wanted to pay me $1000sgd to do such dirt job. I rejected his offer and then he act pity and say he do this with no choice etc, been forced to do this to leave the organisation unless he able to get hold of usd30,000 and already 2 years didnt get to see his family (mum and sister). Telling you he risk his life to disclose the details to me. When i further question him, he told the cmb account that connected with me previously is not his profile. In the profile, the person is taiwaness...but in reality, this scammer say he is currently in china and all this numbers he using to scam ladies are provided by company. Also he admitted that the "tz new media" does not exist and the luring ladies to join defi wallet is part of the scam plan. So ladies, please take note that scammer has up the playing field to use fake profile and asking people to create/maintain profile. HOPE MY SHARING CAN SAVE MORE LADIES IN CMB APP AND OTHER DATING PLATFORM. The contact numbers he used are: +65 80320592 +65 83491733 Another random scam number, after i block him keep msg and call me: +60 19-550 1150
It all started with a random following on Instagram, with no mutual friends, and i could tell that the instagram was newly created, looking at the date on every post. the person would then say that she/he followed you via 'suggested friends' if you do follow him/her back. after a casual chat, he/she would start to ask you for your mobile number to continue the conversation on Whatsapp/telegram or other social platforms. he/she will start using conversation techniques to keep you engaged in the conversation without you realising you have been hooked. he/she would start sending you pictures of "themselves" to make you believe that they are legitimate people. They will then start to introduce you to business platforms whereby you would earn commission of 5% for every transaction or similar, and would either ask you to join, or help him/her with their daily quota. the moment he/she introduced the business platform, i searched it up on the internet and found numerous scams related cases involving the business platform he/she introduced. luckily, i did not do any transaction and was able to detect their techniques that were used on me and reported them on the social platform (i hope the reporting works).
Received a call without the +65 prefix. Caller claimed to be my friend and called to inform me that she just changed her phone number. When I asked for her name, she became “upset” and accused me of not being a good friend for not recognising her voice. I kept asking for her number and she kept saying i’m not a good friend. This went on for awhile until i told her that I would hang up the phone if she didn't tell me her name. And so, she hung up.
between November to December 2022, I've matched with someone named "Sherene" (a.k.a. Lok Qiao) via Tinder. The Tinder Profile was verified. She also has an Instagram account that goes by the handle of @lokqiao_lim625. SHE CLAIMED THAT SHE originates from MELAKA, MALAYSIA, HAVING TWO JOBS IN SG - ONE AS A RETAILER AND THE OTHER A SIDE HUSTLE WITH "MYTHERESA". We exchanged numbers and chatted on WhatsApp. The interaction felt believable. During work hours, she wasn't as responsive to my texts, but only past work hours was she more responsive. She would usually send what she eats for breakfast, lunch and dinner and asked me to do the same to her. We have been chatty since (although I do not reveal much details about myself, of career and whatnot) for 6 days. I've asked her out thrice in between before we agreed on a date (that's already a red flag). At the sixth day, she asked me to do a favour, that is to make some orders from a supposed business number named as "mytheresa.singapore" (the business number is +65 8937 7624). That is where it didn't add up for me, as I understand that e-commerce sites like mytheresa wouldn't facilitate orders in business numbers like that. As Sherene got hasty with me not replying anything about the orders, I proceeded to block her. I've seen similar reports at Scam alert, with one report involving someone named Sherene. The reports stated that it took 3 days before the scammer tries to ask for a favour, while for me, 6 days! Even though I didn't spend a cent on her, I was robbed of my time. My takeaways are as follows: - scammers have been improving their craft to lure people in for their pockets. Be vigilant in talking to strangers online. - never reveal too much about yourself with anyone whom you've never met personally. limit the info you share to whom. - never do favours for someone whom you're not seen ever with your naked eyes - just because a tinder profile is verified, does not mean you do not need to tread with caution. Be cautious with any of your matches. - if you have to ask someone out thrice, then that would not seem right - e-commerce stores do not facilitate orders through a WhatsApp business number. - if you come across a match who claims to do "mytheresa" as a side hustle, then run.
My father was the victim of the scam. He's an elderly pioneer generation who is on the internet daily. A pop-up informing him that his microsoft account was compromised and he needs to call a number, which he did! The call connected him to the scammer who claimed that he was from Microsoft cybersecurity team. The scammer asked him to follow some steps to help them diagnose the issue - these steps essentially gave them control of the laptop and restricted movement on his end (he said that the screen felt locked). From there the scammer could see emails and mentioned that they could see his grandchildren's names. Then the scammer said that they will prevent the hacker from hacking into his computer which could happen in the next hour. The scammer asked him if he had $15,000 and they asked him for his bank account number. He gave them a debit card number of a UOB joint account held by parents my father and mother and told them he did not hold the account. He said he will need to withdraw money from a posb account. The scammer told him to withdraw the money and deposit it into the UOB account. ](note: the whole time my mother said that this was a scam and to call the police but my father kept engaging the scammer). The scammer called again after a few minutes to ask if he have withdrawn the money. The scammer told him he can take a taxi to UOB and they would reimburse the taxi fare! He actually went to POSB to draw the $15,000 but my mother held on to the money. At which point my mother called me, and she refused to let him have the cash. I told them that this was a classic scam, stop engaging the scammer and to report to the police. They lodged a police report. My mother then called uob who froze their account immediately. The police took down their report, and with that presented it to uob. We needed to freeze and close the account, create a new one. We also had to erase and reload the operating system of the laptop; and change the passwords for our Microsoft office and any account that was used in that laptop especially banking and Singpass.
They first sent me a WhatsApp message regarding a "deliveroo" survey which they will then pay me 6sgd. After which their so-called financial teams text me and paynow me the 6sgd then told me that I can earn money by just completing task which I believed and fall for it. As I thought I can earn some side income so that I have enough money to pay rental and save up. After which they invite me to telegram group which they send the task to complete every 3 completion the receptionist will then text me and ask for Paynow number to transfer me the money. I received the money for the completion which then on some task it's a prepaid TASK. The first was 68 followed by 198 which both I managed to withdraw and get back my money so I thought it was legit. Then, there is a third prepaid task of $325 and I did as I trusted it after the first to payment. the task state that after completing the 325 task I will get back close to 400 I did as told and transferred the funds to their merchant and they help to top up the website. After doing the first task of 325 there is a subsequent task of 1888 but I do not have that much and ask if 500 was ok which they agree. Suddenly there is a 3rd task of 2000+ which I really do not have any money left as the money I originally had is been top up in the platform. I ask if I can withdraw myself from the task they say cannot if I withdraw now I would not get back any REFUND or any amount
Match a girl on tinder, her name is Betsy. Initially the conversation went really well as to the point where i really thought that it was a legit profile. she requested to add her Whatsapp and the conversation escalated real quick to talking about her ex and then about her future. A little suspicious of the actions back then but it was still relatively subtle as she as evidence of her being a legit person since she as taken a few photos that look like a normal office set up, problem was when she mentioned the location, i don't think there was any such office around that area. even her number was a business account on Whatsapp, which i initially questioned but she push it off by stating that it was because she used her business mobile more often that her personal number. Next, was when she started her ploy of saying that she was really tired and had red eyes as she has to finish her job, which i offered to help. she then sent me a phone number "+65 8549 0446" indicating it is her 24/7 hotline for her company called LUISA VIA ROMA which is a bot messaging platform. i would require to follow the steps indicated there in order to "help her" with her work. always fishy when it comes to online transactions and i searched and found out several other scams that involves using this company names, all with the intention to get you to paynow for a product and then get a 5% comm, like those job scam ads. end of the day I didn't help and she was trying to guilt tip me into saying that he was tired and so on. Moral of the story, do not trust online platforms too much especially when conversations are going too smoothly and the person asked you to helped her to do her job!
Met this person named andy chen in CMB app, and we moved to whatapp to chat after 1 day. As CMB app is always have delayed notification. His profile in cmb showed he owns a business (advertising agency) and was from taiwan, currently working in singapore. He will told he study in china from young as parents working there, after graduate moved back to taiwan and then relocated to singapore for years. He will sweet talk you and tell you he thinks you are the one he looking for. After a few days chat, he will share about defi and asking you to put 500usd in. Telling he hopes you can earn money with him and plan for the furture. When you reject to go into defi, he will say you are not self-motivated to have a better life. So ladies out there, please be careful of the guys out there on dating apps. Also when he added you in whatsapp, look out for red flags: 1) asked for his namecard and company name - he told he don't carry one and could not find his namecard - Provided company name 'TZ new media'. No such company registered in singapore and there is no trace of digital footprints on website 2) when he ask about where are you and why never ask him along - offer to allow him to join in, but he will never dare to show up. Telling you that he afraid you will be shy. 3) in CMB app, he will remove the chat with you. So you cannot trace his profile and report him in CMB directly. - another possibility could be, he is re-using the account with another person profile pictures 4) a guy interested in you shall not force you to any investiment - Defi, cryto, private crowd funding , etc - ladies, please do not even try even if amount is small like 500usd. I rather you donate to charity than to scammers.
At the end of December last year, I was looking for a part-time job to earn some living expenses, and I just saw this person on Facebook advertising, but the content of the promotion was written to be responsible for admin work from home, and would use the computer and have a basic English, so I thought it was a legitimate job. When I started to inquire, this person told me that his job was risk-free and safe. But he needed to use my bank account, although I was full of doubts, he told me that because the company needed to close the accounts every day, and I was just the middleman, I just needed to transfer money for him every day and record up how much I helped transfer. But after a month, he told me that my account was frozen and I was surprised because I didn't understand what was going on. He told me that he would now use his company's diplomatic relations to help me deal with this matter to avoid me being arrested by the police, I did not understand why I should be arrested when I had done nothing wrong, and the premise of his help in dealing with this matter was that a large amount of money was needed and I needed to transfer it to him. Because I am a college student I also do not have money, he has been pretending to be kind and said he could help me give part of it, he will use the company's money, as a way to deceive me to transfer money, and after that there has been a diplomat needing money to continue to deal with things appeared, I felt that something was very wrong with the whole situation. The accounts that have been asking me to help transfer money include (POSB saving acc 4235425??) and (uob bank 38832484??) these two accounts

Went on to tell you take he lost his phone and wallet in a renovation and this is his new number and old number is not in use any longer. will end call after that so that you dont think it is a scam because he doesnt ask you for money on the first call. The following day he will call you again to tell you about his renovation and that previously he shared that he lost his wallet and now in need of money to pay the renovation fees. Asked if you could transfer money to the bank account.
Based on the call number, which was not SG number, i could assess that the caller is a scammer. I asked for his employee's ID, and he ended the call. Sharing with fellow users to be wary of such impersonation scams!
Received a message from a "perlita from Zeno events" Addressing me by my Carousell's username and encouraged me to complete a survey
Initially, I was contacted from a Malaysian number asking my interest in part-time job. When I showed interested i have received a message from Singapore number asking my free time to explain about the job. Later one guy explained me what I have to do and he invited me to a WhatsApp group. According to him that group is a bunch of people who actively doing this job and warning their fair profit. The scheme is a app enhancement program and we have to start invest money starting from 150$ and they will provide profit on each day. But the investment add up exponentially and they will make you believe to add more money for better return. The moment you join the WhatsApp group, someone will contact and ask the progress and make you believe that they are also joined recently and picking up fast. I lost almost $1,400 and then understand that the group itself is a bunch of scammers with all having registered Singapore phone number. All the transactions were happening through paynow. Later the guy who owns the number challenged me to go and give police complain when I asked for a refund. Company website is mediamanager.com.sg.
I received a friend request on Instagram from username jeffrey_1991830, and accepted out of curiosity. This guy introduced himself as Lin Yu, who came from China few months ago and claimed to own a company here, have a person assistant, 2 cars in sg and resides in south beach tower. He was a smooth talker, tried to constantly initiate small chats and profess his interest in me right on the first day we met online. Eventually, we continued our conversation on WhatsApp and he led me into downloading this cryptocurrency app called mew wallet and instructed me to invest $500 for the beginning but i refused. To gain my trust, he went ahead and transferred the $500 credit from his account to mine, asking me to contact the platform cs to withdraw new user bonus rewards, which i was then being led to chat with cs on Telegram. I was told to fill in some bank account details to receive the money but i refused to do so. Somehow, i managed to get him to fill his bank details and the details was for byron ng ee xuan, which totally doesn't match the name that he has told me. He gave excuses that it was his new identity in SG, hence was different from his Chinese birth name. I was constantly being pressured to get involve in the crypto wallet, whenever i refuse he would turn outrage and kept saying that he's hurt as i don't trust him. I requested to meet up but he will give excuses that he's busy with work. In the end, i put it straight that i do not want to be involved in the crypto investment, he flared and stopped messaging me. No money loss, ladies pls be vigilant and don't fall into such scam.
"John Williams" (fake name - he had a thick indian accent) called at 9am today from "Singtel" and launched in to saying that there's a problem with my singel wifi and to check my router. No security check or anything.... It was a Malaysian phone number so i knew it could be a scam when i picked up. I asked him to tell me my name and address. Obviously he couldn't... ....because i don't have WiFi with singte!!. I told him that, that i knew it was a scam and was going to report the number today and he went silent. I can see there are other reports of this same guy in this forum. He's clearly worked in the industry before as he knew the right jargon to use. His english was good. Called me from (+60 16 4011686)
Scammer reached out to be out of the blue on Instagram and tried to trick me into giving him access to my Instagram account by getting my email address to collect a prize for a survey. Beware of this trap! Don't be lured by unbelievable prize money!
I received an email from “CASE” today.Email informed me that my CASE dispute has been successfully referred to their collection and compensation department for assessment, and i have been found eligible for compensation. They issue a ticket number and chat icon for me to click to contact case org for reimbursement. I did not get scammed.
The scammer called me impersonating as my friend. He informed that he lost his mobile phone as such has changed his number. he also mentioned that he has lost his wallet. he needs help from me as he urgently need to pay his supplier and he is at ica renewing his documents unable to personally pay his supplier or meet me to collect the money. he mentioned that i can paynow to his supplier, inview of the urgency. I was about to proceed but have doubts so I contacted our mutual friends to check and if they are aware of this. My friends said they were not contacted by this friend and suggested that I called back my friend's original "old" mobile number to verify. After calling the original number, I realised that i was scammed.
JasminE from Skyline Travel &amp; Consulting PTE LTD reached out via Whatsapp for a simple survey and reward you $6 for participation, another lady name Connie msg from whatsapp asking whether keen to participate in their paid activities, the task is very simple, she will provide a random youtube video link, just click on the link then hit like on the video then take a screenshot and write the activity number on the screenshot and show it to her. The reward is $15. Next activity she will add me to a telegram group chat where there are 100+ members posting screenshots. For 3 video likes $12-$15. All tasks are paid. Later i question the receptionist-Alanna whether is this legal and who are these merchants who are paying out the sum, but she claimed it is legal but later I found some similar scam cases so i decided to block them.
I received a phone call yesterday, new number, and he spoke with Malaysian accent mandarin. i used to work in Malaysia, and have many Malaysian co workers too. he immediately said hey i changed my number, the old number no longer valid, please save this number. I was like, who is this? He replied you cannot recognize my voice? He was playing tricks on me, by saying that we know each other in &lt;alaysia, the fat one he said.... when i told him i don't know any fat person in Malaysia, then he said he is not fat but chubby... anyway i said "Ah qiang?" he said what took you so long? To be honest, they sounded alike but this guy is obviously older, the guy i know sounds more kiddish. but as I was busy, I didn't pay much attention. He said he has this shop opening on 4th feb, and want to invite me over for buffet, so I said ok. This fake Ah Qiang called me just now, and said that he lost his phone and couldn't do an internet transfer to his suppliers, thus need me to help him do fund transfer. i know my co worker and his family very well, if indeed he has issues, he will ask him wife or bro in law for help, and won't ask me. so that's when I realized this guy is a scammer. I pretended that his signal is bad that i couldn't hear him very well, asked him to whatsapp me the details, but he didn't. he called again and i told him i still can't hear him well, please send me the details. as he hanged up, i took the opportunity to call my other co workers and confirmed that he didn't change his number at all. i blocked this number and went to do a police report on i witness. hope that no one will fall prey into this type of scam.
Caller claimed to be from SingPost, said that criminals used my back account to transfer $100,000. Asked me to download app to my pc. asked for my bank account number. That was when i put down the phone.
I got a random number from this guy on whatsapp, claiming to be head of operations from shopee (red flag). He is offering $20 to like youtube videos... Which is too good to be true.. But i did out of greed and got the $.. but as time passes, he mentioned if i want to earn $50-$450 for a part time job (which is the same, liking youtube videos... And asked me to find a person called @tutor258 on telegram... And the person asked for my personal details (name, age, wa number, occupation, city, etc) - which i gave... Foolishly, and asked me to join their task group - and i joined. But now, i have to pay in different tiers for more tasks ($170 to get $340 worth of tasks, $568 to get $1028, etc..) Although in the group, there are many people (which i think are fake task-dooers... Would send their screenshots to prove that they received cash after transferring the money...) It does not make sense... So i just quit. Same situation, but different person (named aaliyah, now named joyi, but picture is a man... Contact: 88541329)... Who asked me to click on a suspicious link after completing the task. (darea.live and wayfair.com - scam, do not click) One too -&gt; +57 310 5151597 - maria isabel (claimed to give weekly salary of $200 - $1500) to like tiktok/yt videos (which i did not respond) Another task (the tourist attraction survey scam) +62 815 8556 6216 (barbra), +60 11 2881 1479 (carmen), +60 11 2106 5807 (another carmen), +1 207 694-9769 (christine from asa holidays) all these did not compensate the money for the same survey (yes, i was greedy... But ya same survey from these people) - they will ask: 1. What is the most famous tourist attraction in sg - then you answer either one a) uss, b) gardens by the bay, c) sg zoo... And 2. Have you ever been to this place before? A) yes b) no... But just to let you know if they give you money, you'd get reeled in to pay them in the end as you get deeper into their trap.. Another one from sherly (87616594) then directed me to desmond lee (89142032) who sent me a hotel review scam site (hostelworld.com - scam!! Do not click) please be aware, those jobs to like youtube/tiktok/etc videos or ask you to answer simple qns (before asking you to pay for different tiered tasks) or "boost a seller on platform" are a scam... And always... Never pay for a job.
1) HOW IT HAPPENED: a whatsapp message on a survey on singapore attractions. 2) WHEN IT HAPPENED: 13-14 Jan 2023 3) HOW MUCH WAS LOST: SGD 24805 job scam summary it all started from a WhatsApp message sent to me to answer a very simple survey on singapore and yourself. after answering the survey on whatsapp, she told me to contact her receptionist via telegram IF I WERE INTERESTED to learn MORE JOB OPPORTUNITY. on telegram, the receptionist asked me for my personal details (name, Gender, Age, Nationality, WhatsAPP no., Occupation) and THEN INTRODUCED ME THE work/mission WAS TO like youtube videos and share screenshot of the like to a telegroup. day 1, the work was easy and seeing actual money flowing into my bank had me convinced that they are trustable. on my day 2, i participated in a rare mission named prepaid activities. in this mission, i was added to telegroup chat named "task group" with a supervisor and another 3 more members. this mission required us to create an account on a not secured currency exchange website and pool in money to a middleman for funds to do the exchange on the website. it takes several rounds to complete the pooling of money and the basic money to pool in just kept increasing. wanting to back out but i was too deep in so i continued to transfer. $529 &gt; $1566 &gt; $4998 &gt; $16885 however, when i thought it was finally completed, i was told that my transaction had failed and i would have to put in another $50655 to get back what i failed. when i told them these were all i have and i really have no choice but to withdraw, they kept convincing me to ask around for help. THE RECEPTIONIST MANAGED TO GATHER 15K and a kind soul from the same task group chat offered to help to cover whatever i was left with. i was elated and transferred my last bit of money to the middle man. *declined* i received a call from the bank and was told that i have been transferring money to accounts from another bank that are already marked as scam. Reflection on the red flags that i should have noticed:- - people in the group chat are too happy to welcome the prepaid task - their words did not match e.g some people mentioned the prepaid task is rare but being in the group chat for 2 days, i already seen such activity 3 times. - too easy money - "force me" to transfer money within a short time frame - "kind soul" who was too nice to borrow me, a stranger, 30k - many different middleman accounts to transfer - my output was more than what i earned from them (should have realize at this point this is not a job)
The caller claimed he knew me for very long and this is his new hp number. I questioned him, who him was without answer. ended I told him, if he refused to say, I would hang up, immediately he himself hang up the call. concern was where the caller got my hp number and able to address my name.
Malaysian accent claiming long lost friend and lost his phone. This is his new number and to save his number. Whatsapp me saying to keep in touch. It's obviously a scam call!
On 3rd of January, I saw this loan advertisement on social media, in the first place I thought was licensed money lender so I click on the link to submit my name and my phone number , I was contacted by This Malaysian guy name Benson he told me I was required TO submit my 12 weeks earning report, my nric and my next of kin contact NUMBER and how much loan I going to apply SO I told him I apply for $500. After that the funds was approved and transfer to my bank account. After then he told Me that he is from unlicensed MONEYLENDER. He told me about Payment $500 but return $700 if you can't pay on time that is a fee of $200 for deferment. On the 10 January, I am able to clear all the amount $700 and then I received a WhatsApp number claiming to be this Benson, so I just transferred the funds because I thought was him and screenshot the receipt to him. Then, he told me that I input the reference numer wrongly, and so I asked what to do next. Then, he said never mind. After I sent the screenshot to the real guy Benson he directly call me say he never received the payment. So I asked this time how. He requested me to make a payment of $200 for deferment. So I just made the payment because I didn't want any trouble. After consulting my friend about this, they shared that I fell prey to a loan scam, and so I suspended all my bank accounts and would file a police report.
A scammer called from 81918075 saying it's his new number. I asked for his name and he said: "You don't know me? I know you how long already". I just gave him a silly response and hung up the call.

1) i answered to a whatsapp request on a survey on singapore attractions.2) it happened just last week during.3) i lost a total of $14,000 sgd.Brief summary a sms was sent to phone saying that it will pay a commission ($6) to answer a simple survey on singapore attractions. I felt is was a simple request and responded to the message. Following the answer, the person referred me to a colleague who will pay out the commission. The colleague then asked for my name age and number to pay out the commission. She then asked me if i was interested to earn more commissions by liking youtube videos by sending screenshots on telegram which i agreed to, i then earned some commissions. Subsequently, the colleague referred me to search for @judy6655 and her on telegram for the mission (task) to be completed. (judy) then asked if i am interested to complete some tasks to earn more commissions. I agreed and was asked to create an account on a link (fddf1.com) she gave. The website was used to purchase cryptocurrency. (judy) assured me that her colleague (kennedy) would guide us to make the investment and the returns would double. Upon completion of the first 2 tasks, the commissions were payed back to my bank account to gain my trust that the platform was legitimate. It even had the name of the person who transferred the monies. On 6 jan 2023, (kennedy) then texted me on telegram. He gave me another link (562oz.com) and gave specific instructions to purchase on the website which i followed. In order to withdraw the money earned in the transaction, i would have to top up money into the account. I would have to transfer money to (kennedy) through (judy) so that the money will be credited to my account on the website. I then transferred and followed the instructions to them and kennedy kept on asking me to top up more money as someone in the group made an error. I then suspected this is a scam and i decided to lodge a police report to make others aware. I did earn a little at the beginning but eventually, i lost around $14K!

i got a call from 1800 656 2567 to approve a credit card transaction of S$4K. I did not make any transaction on my uob card so opted to speak to a phone operator. the operator told me that this transaction was made on a uob visa metro card that was applied on 19 December 2022 at UOB Tampines Branch. i told him i did not apply for any card recently so he concluded that this is a misuse of identity and should be reported to the police. i asked if he could check the address where the card was sent to and he said blk 8 french road #04-26. he told me to also have the police officer check if my identity was misused for any other loan or credit card applications. So this "Adrian Tan" transferred me to "inspector lee wei ning". i described the whole situation to this inspector and he warned me not to provide anyone photocopies of my ic. then he went through a sop to do a phone recording that he said would take 30 to 45 minutes and that i had to be in a quiet place.I asked him how do I ensure that i'm really speaking to a real police officer, as this call was transferred. He pretended to be surprised that this call was transferred from the uob operator. So i told him i would call the cantonment police hotline just to be sure.I called the police station and they told me there is no "lee wei ning". I called uob fraud hotline and turned out there was no such metro credit card under my name.

I was not scammed by always a target of scam calls, to a stage sometimes I don't even pick up call from local numbers. I just received a call with number +1800 5995625. The moment I heard the lady voice saying that I owe UOB over 4000 dollars due to a transaction, I ended the call. I wanted to update here to prevent others from getting scammed! Be wary, guys!
Caller called and said my name ("eh xxx ah?"). followed by "I changed my number and this is my new number, you know who i am?" asking me to guess, however i insisted that i don't know and so he claimed he was "alan". when i said i'm busy, he informed that he will whatsapp me but i did not receive any whatsapp. The next day, 2 other numbers (81738241 &amp; 81758967) was received by me, it was the same guy with malaysian accent and repeated the same lines above. i was sure it is a scam as he hung up immediately when i informed him to stop the call. Please note that the incoming number does not have a "+" prefix.
Received a call from “8167 0792” without the “+65” prefix. It was an automated machine which impersonated ica and gave callers options to speak to an english or a mandarin operator. Please be wary of unknown phone calls!
1. the scammer called and asked me to guess who he was, and that he was a close friend. 2. he explained he was using this number because he lost his phone. 3. on the same call, he invited me to an event - a cafe opening on 1st jan 2023, and said he would provide details later. 4. the next day, he called again and asked for me to loan him money to pay his suppliers, i rejected on the spot as i thought something was fishy. 5. i then called the actual person i thought he was, and found out it was an impersonation. 6. i called back the scammer and he was not shy to admit it was a scam 7. no money or personal information was lost.
I was approached by this lady name "jacclyn" from Malacca on Instagram, we took it offline to whatsapp and started talking. she claimed that she's an interior design in singapore and doing this part time job on the side. like what other victims mentioned, "she" claimed that she is tired and that "her" eyes hurt a lot. "she" asked if i could help her to run some errands on "her" behalf. i was referred to this bvlgari customer service to help out with this 'part time job' shown below. however, it became really suspicious to me once the amount i had to pay first kept on increasing, before getting a refund. i was unable to get back the $499 which i paid upfront, as i did not complete the order, which required me to pay for 4 more of the same item, which cost $499. as i realized something was amiss, i made a police report immediately and called the bank to block all my bank account. i hope this shed some light to other people and not to fall for this scam. please be careful of this lady with ig tag @jacclynlove/@jerlynlimlove, mobile number will be 8915594?. detail of the fake bvlgari merchant as below: bvlgari promoter id: bvlgari_44710 commission for this product: 5% number of products: 1 payment method: paynow or online bank transfer paynow info: cimb name: sng wei lee acc no: 1003386??? paynow: 846608?? bvlgari task operation process: 1.

Though you selected 159 they will ask you to deposit more money once you finish a subtask like 500 sgd for the next subtask. If you do not do it, you cannot get the remaining amount you invested in the account on their platform. I deposited $159 and did a sub-task and then they ask me to deposit 500 more to do the next task. That is not what i agreed and i skipped it. After that, I was not able to receive the money, and this information you will not know before you invest the money. So, my advice does not fall for this scam.
Got connected via fb. chat went well and reply was very prompt. Tell tale signs of such scam 1.She will suggest to chat on whatapp and explain how it will change the communication 2.Malaysian working as HR in Singapore, stayed alone - Novena in her case 3.she will text every morning, lunch and evening, usually in mandarin and ocassionally some singlish 4.Even told her that I'm suspecting that she is scammer and she can quick turn the situation around using Guilt trip. 5.scam start when she explained she working part time helping an website (cant remember the name "Online tri....") to enter order but supplier will not actual transaction. This is to help boost the rating of the platform and in reutrn she will get a commission. 6.starts to explain she has a lot of orders to make and her neck hurts badly. Ask to help her to enter some orders and she will guide along. And thats why I ends. Read other stories from here and have insights on how they operate (quite similar). Usually, they will let you see the commission from the 1st transaction but the fun starts from the sub transaction where price is much higher.
I came across a post on Facebook marketplace stating there was an installment plan I could take on so I clicked on the poster which led me to a direct contact on whatsapp. The following day I was contacted by this man named 'Nicholas leow' he took down my particulars and agreed to send me my phone by a specific time. Everything seemed as normal as it could be. Transfer was made and purchase was completed. Few mins later he tells me I need to purchase an apple care warranty to which I've never heard of so I told him 'no'. He was extremely convincing to the fact I yielded and transferred the amount. He promised to refund me the money once the warranty was purchased. Horror starts: what seemed to be few mins of return refund extended time. He wasn't able to refund my monet due to capitalisation error on the name part of my transfer. Small detail errors which led me to believe it was my fault. I trusted his words and blindly transfered the money. On my part I was at a vulnerable position not in the right mental state and acted out of impulsively. Till today, he messaged me saying he will refund my money but to no avail
Met on Tinder and chatted on telegram. Video-call twice. Said the sweetest words ever and asked to be in relationship on the 5th day of chatting. Said yes on the 7th day as curious to find out how true that person was. Then He started to talk about his business failure and said that he will come to Singapore to complete his company project. But he will take the bank loan to settle his financial problems etc. Before coming to Singapore, he told me that only half of his loan is approved, payment for his workers are overdue and workers are starving etc. Then he started to ask me to transfer money. I refused and yet he came up with more and more drama in attempt to ask me for money. I had BLOCKed his telegram and his Singapore number. I hope I am safe from here.
I got approached on WhatsApp by a job recruiter. At first, it's to click on like and advertising, but suddenly the system got prompt error and started the trap within 5 people (1 'teacher' and 3 more 'partners'), various time of transaction make without return. Reported the matter to the police.

I recently encountered a scam call type pretending to be your friend and asked you to save his "new" phoen number and delete his old one. When I kept asking who is this. He retorted why i forget him so quickly when we are good friend. I kept inaisting on him revealing his name he could not! There is one obvious sign it s a scam. Remember to ask him to verify his identity even though you think he is your good friend. Never assume and never volunteer info for him tp use against you.
Received a text message from the scammer claiming that my bill was overdued. "LTA: YOUR SEPTEMBER BILL IS OVERDUE and will be fined. please check and complete the payment: https://cnfh.link/lta (NOTE: Phishing link, do not click) I was initially worried but realised it's a scam by taking note of the website link and the fact that i was directed to click on it to check the amount for payment.
Someone called pretending to be a friend who is an actor. He called Sunday saying his phone and wallet got stolen and he lost his contacts and that he'd call me tomorrow. He called me Monday and said he needed $8800 I asked that he accept my WHAT'SAPP invite so we could video chat. He came up with excuses. I told him to call me back in 5 minutes as I didn't have that kind of money but my mom did. I then hung up and called "My real friend" who was just as bewildered as me. I strongly suspect that My actor friend's VOICE was deep faked by the scammers which explains why he sounded so much like my friend. His refusal to video call with me also made me suspicious BEWARE - scammers now have the ability to fake someone's voice. If you have a friend suddenly call (with an unknown phone number) from out of the blue; claiming to have lost his phone, wallet etc. and ask for a sum of money urgently...say no or tell him to call back in 5 mins. Hang up then call the legitimate person back to verify.
'We are unable to proceed with your order due to an incorrect address, please visit https://trackinginfo-sg.com/942spd (Note: Phishing website. Do NOT click) to change the information.' Received an sms (from infosms) that due to incorrect address, my package was not able to be delivered. As I had incoming tracking items, i opened the url. The website looks identical to singpost website, with all the same colors and fonts used. However the tracking number was a little weird, ex140180193sg they wanted me full name &amp; full address details. I immediately called SingPost directly and they informed that it was a scam as they have received many calls of such cases as well!

ON 16 Dec, received a call from this number claiming to be a good friend of mine. However he did not reveal his idetity until i randomly guessed my old friend when he affirmed that that is him. During this call, scammer claim that he has lost his phone, and asked me to update his contact to this new number. On 17 Dec, got a whatsapp message from this number enquiring how to change the otp using the posb bank app. (this seems like a trivial task for my friend which I believe he would know how to do) hence I called my friend's old number to verify the details with him and I got to know he did not lose his phone at all. Beware of fake phone calls, guys!
i have received a message from cindy saying that they have job apportunities do i need pr/spr at this moment. then another nymber saying tha t he has a job for me this is the conversation: 'The main job is to help Developers App rating,the company has provides us a working platform to improve the star rating of App and get good reviews for each App, which can be seen on the Play Store/App StoreWe don't need to raise the star rating at the App/Play store one by one either, the company has signed a contract with Developers to allow us to work on the company platform This is new agent joined yesterday and to be honest I don't have much interest in the job either, it's just that prices are going up now and I just want to make sure I don't get tangled up over a $100 when I'm shopping.

Met this Guy via OKCUpid and eventually proceed to telegram and whatsapp to Chat. all was alright until he start to talk about private equity investment by SEA online.

Hard to differentiate and u will believe without thinking throughly. the projects listed for investments are also local HDB bTO. requested for meetups and video call, he will give excuses of being overseas for work(2 weeks) and phone camera is block due to some non disclosure of a project he signed. be wary! Link that he send to download the SEA ONLINE private equity app: https://seaonline.eke????

A recruiter named anna first approached me with a job offer on Whatsapp. She then passed me Alecia imran’s contact who mentioned she is rhe hiring manager in CONJUNCTION with capgemini and top 3 media ltd and i decided continue playing along. I asked her how can she prove that this is a legitimate offer and why would she think im a good fit for the role and the company, however Both parties had serious spelling and grammatical errors, she did not understand what i was trying to say and just shared with me a bunch of so called company info i could easily google Company Address: 390 Havelock Road King Centre #08-01 Company Postcode: Singapore 169662 Company Email: Top3Media@Singapore.com Told her off later for wasting my time
Received a message about a survey, doing it will give a $6 reward. And I really received it! Got directed to another number to follow instructions by another telegram number, and later on received another $15. Then there's a list of things that we can continue doing to earn, but I didn't have time to continue to understand how this may be a scam. So Am filing it to learn. Anyway, there's indians starting to call me on my number this past 2 days, trying to say they are giving me crypto money of $11k, with really noisy background with no noise isolation, can hear the other scammers very clearly. the 3 calls all asked if i have anydesk on my computer, so I can allow them to connect to my computer to proceed with the transfer. they knew my name (which I guess, is from the paynow account to confirm my details). Beware of such scams!
It started around 3 months ago when I first received the 1st scam call, claiming to be someone i know and he has recently changed his number. initially I thought he was someone I know and called him by the name of "louis", then he quickly acknowledged that he is Louis and he told me he has a friend's whose shop is opening soon and would like to invite me over and will text me the opening details then he hung up. However, the text never came in. Few weeks later, the same guy called and told me another story, saying that he needs to pay off something but he is short of cash and would asking whether i could help to transfer him some money and he would pay me off later of the say. i told him I could not and then shortly, he ended the call. 1 month later, i received a call claiming the same story as the 1st scam call, saying he has changed his number and we have had dinner previously, that i should remember him. after i inisisted that i do not remember him and have him to identify himself, he said he will text me (obviously the text never came). Today, I received a call from the same guy but a different number, using the same old story as his 1st scam call. upon having him to identify himself, he hung up my call. so far, nothing was lost and i have identified 3 different sg mobile numbers and blocked all of them. the man sounded like malaysian accent and spoke in mandarin, therefore i presume he should be Chinese in his middle age.
I've got a message from phone number that is shown as 'rasg'. The message goes like this: ONE MOTORING - There are unpaid tolls on the October bill, please deal with s.id/LT-sSgBA immediately to avoid being blacklisted and affecting travel
I received a robocall informing me i had some fines at ICA due to an expired passport. I hit "1" on the phone and man said, "Hello, ICA". I hung up the phone immediately.
I was contacted through whatsapp about a job offer and my profile was gotten from jobstreet. it was when i was actively looking for a job, so i was quite inclined to believe. then i was redirected to another person on whatsapp who will describe the job to me. Then, there will be a test job that will payout $15 after completing. At first, the tasks given are like the test job that was done at the start, then suddenly there are prepaid tasks that have to transfer a starting amount then complete and get back with extra. the starting value started to increase, and then suddenly it became harder to pay and they will ask if you want to apply for advance payment. if you ask for it and complete the task, they will say you will have to return the advance payment first before you can get back the money due to personal credibility.
I received an SMS from 'smsauth' saying i have a Singpost parcel held up. At first, I did not suspect anything as I did have someone mailing things to me. So i clicked into the link and it asked for my name contact and address. After i keyed in those it then asked for a small fee to re-deilver the package. It is then that I got suspicious and start online goggling. And on Singpost they say they would under no circumstances ask people for their personal details or credit card payment through weblink and SMS so it definitely is a scam. Hope whoever doubt the same thing in future would know this is a scam do not fall for it.
Received msg through instagram, later ask for whatsapp contact to share more on places for nice food. First day, she sent her daily life photo with baby, i thought it was real until second day she ask to help her perform some online markerting with Chanel in return for commission. She sent a customer service contact and was directed to Chanel product link. And was asked to take screenshot and sent to cs no (81719038), which will then sent an account number and paynow (855893??)to transfer as per the product which cost $98, in return they will transfer $113 to the account. I did as they said and received $113 but she asked for more transactions which i became suspicious and stop. She then became mad and scolded me for not trusting her. After some online searched and found it was a scam. L Luckily, no monetary lost.

I got scammed on my first time trying to sell an item on carousell.The fake buyer contacted me in the app almost immediately after i post the product ($20 necklaces). They said they want to purchase but will need my email and phone number to proceed. As a first time seller, i didn’t know it was the begin of a scam. I provided the details then, right after that I received an email saying the purchase was made successfully and it look very professional, just like a legit carousell email. I proceed on clicking the button "confirm order" and got redirect to a order tracking page where i have to input my card details. I thought it was normal to input my card details there just like how i usually make online payment, however it is not. In the form, they also ask for my card balance, i was doubting for a moment, but the fake buyer keep pushing me and told me they have already paid but why i can’t confirm them. I didn’t realize in that second, i just don’t want people to worry, and quickly key in all the required information in that form (including card number, date of expiry, cvv, card balance, and ended up with otp).I’m sharing my story here hoping that no one would ever be a victim of this scam anymore. I don’t know why people would do this to each other. I have my lesson, please don’t be like me..
I was contacted by a lady named Grace at WhatsApp claiming they had a job which offers commission for rating luxury hotels for IHG. I replied that I was interested and they ask another lady named Doris to text me on telegram regarding the job offer. She directed me to a website to register for an account to do the job which required me to do 35 hotel reviews to earn commission. After the first (trial) round i was told that i have to deposit $100 to continue doing. I was added to a telegram group called "IHG VICTORY TEAM" where there are 25 members chit about life activities, their food they eating, and also screenshots of them doing this job, profit etc After topping up my bank account, I decided to deposit and continue doing another round, after 15/35 completed, a luxury hotel booking appeared which the customer service (which I have to whatsapp to make deposits and get wallet address) requires me to deposit $300+ to continue. I did so and at 22/35, 34/35 another luxury offer appeared and I had to deposit $700++, $1300++ to continue. I did so again and at 35/35, another luxury offer appeared and I have to deposit $4800 I realise something is wrong. they ask me to ask friend or family to pay for me and insist me to complete the offer so i could withdraw the commission. I did not do so and message them to ask them why and no reply. In total almost $3k lost. https://www.wolrd-widetours.live/index/user/login.html (Note: Fake job website.

I got a call from number + 88279… 8th dec. A robocall claimed that it was from 'UOB' Customer service and that I had made a transaction of $4350. It said press 0 to talk to operator. I pressed 0. A man called Hendrick chan answered and offered to resolve my query. He spoke smoothly in english throughout the call. He was very convincing in how he spoke. He asked my name. I gave him a fake name ! He verified and said he has some information for this name but he needed my ic to proceed. I told him that no bank is using ic verification nowadays. He still insisted for it. So i gave him a fake ic !! He verified it and said it is the wrong ic ! I am not sure how he knew that. But i told him that maybe my ic was wrong because i don’t even have a UOB account !! I told him he is a scammer. But he maintained his professional tone and kept up his story that he was an employee of uob Tampines branch.My husband recorded the whole conversation because i alerted him to the scam call once i had seen the +88 number and once the man started talking in english. I put him on mute for a minute while i ran to my husband and told him to record it on his phone.

We review on the workday platform (https://www.workdaybng.com) The main job here to help seller`s create data and write review for merchant products, so that the merchant can sell successfully. She asked me to use her account to do first and earn 25% commission. i dont need any deposit. Then i will use my account to do 40 data for review. at first I have credit from the commission that i get. then when the product review is more then my credit and usually for that kind of review i will get 3% commission. i will have to bank in money to continue. the first time i earned about $104 bucks that make me believe its not a scam. the next day when i did the review, the amount to transfer getting bigger and bigger and i fell for it, from hundreds to thousands of dollars. I keep on recharged as i wanted my money back fully at the end of the review as their promised. I ended up have not enough money to do recharge and the customer service can't do anything to help and told me to settle and find money on my own. I find it very fishy but its too late. I already transfer alot around $17k plus. So i believe i'm being scammed as i can't get back the money because i don't have enough money to continue.

potential buyer anthony left his email address for interest in getting the ballet tights through Carousell, mentioned that he was overseas and request for the purchase to be mailed to malaysia. addressed to: Name - Johan Prietto Address - Block A-7,Pacific place,Jalan PJU 1a/4, Ara Damansara, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia Zip code - 47301 City - Petaling Jaya State - Selangor Country - Malaysia I received an email from Citibank (transferoffice@usa.com) asking me to provide tracking details before payment will be released to my bank account. without much thought i actually proceeded to post office to post the item and forwarding photo of the receipt and the send package to both anthony and the so called citibank email. replied with an email stating that: All the verification has been made and payment of SG:$34.10 is ready to be confirmed into your bank account. But while making the transfer we realized that your account has never received a transfer from a USA Authorized Account internationally before,Which you will need to activate before your account can be credited with the amount. Account Activation - A refundable activation fees of SG:$490 will be paid for account activation from any country across the globe. requesting to transfer the SGD490 to a malaysia cimb bank. Account Number - 7632428456 Account Holder's Name - Selvida Sianturi Bank Name - CIMB (Malaysia) Swift Code - CIBBMYKLXXX Bank Address - Menara CIMB Floor 13 2 Jalan Stesen Sentral Kuala Lumpur Sentral Kuala Lumpur Malaysia Receiver’s address - 67 Jalan galloway bukit bintang 50150 Kuala Lumpur Wilayah Persekutuan Malaysia this got me thinking and suspecting a scam. thinking of foregoing the payment (treat it as a charity). it doesn't make sense to pay a sgd490 for a sgd34.10 payment. hence, i started to google about usa citibank requiring a payment to activate account and came across a write up on scam alert on a similar story. https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-28Jun2022110437AM immediately i wrote to sing post stating a scam, requesting to retrieve back my postage. i hope i'll get a reply soon. Please be careful as this scam seems to have made a comeback.

Received a phone call today from this unknown caller who was able to address me by my name. He sounded like he knew me. He then went on to share that he just changed his number and that this was his new number. I asked him for his name, but he kept saying “you really don't know me? How can it be? So disappointed, etc". I told him I really don't know and he does speak with Malaysian chinese accent. The conversation ended when I told him that I’m currently working and has no time to guess who he is. He claimed he will call me back and asked me to think who he is and he hung up..... I blocked his numbers immediately as firstly i don't have friend who is so rude to hung up the call just like that. When i read another post here, it seemed it share some similarities. He did sound like my air-con service man. Be careful everyone .

On 27 Nov, scammer called and said he lost his MOBILE/wallet and that this is his replacement mobile NUMBER and had cancelled the old number. He knew my name and sounded like my Aircon servicing contractor. He then said wanted to invite me to his new cafe venture at bedok mall opening day buffet LUNCH the following Saturday. The next day, the scammer called and asked if I can loan him $3600 to pay his supplier as his account is temporary not Accessible after police loss report. He even assured that can repay by after 3.30pm. I said will call him as I am busy and then decided to call the old number. Fortunately, my Aircon servicing guy answered and clarified that he did not loss his phone and didn't call me the day before. I RELATED to him what happened aND he told me his other customers had similar encounters a few months back. I realized That call was A scam attempt. Strange thing was the caller knew my NAME but didn't identify HIMSELF. He ATTEMPTED to IMPERSONATE as a familiar person and was trying to trick me into calling out a name. This is his trick.
"Guess who am I" scam via local phone call (NO +65 prefix), except that the scammer already knew the name of the person he was IMPERSONATING. Said he lost his phone in Jb, asked me to savd his phone number to this new local NUMBER instead. Next day, received WhatsApp call from this new number. Said his bank account was locked. Ask to help with a bank transfer to a Contractor. Provided some local fall Guy's bank acc number. Sent additional voice messages in Mandarin. I Paynowed to this "Contractor". He promised to pay in 24 hours. After another day, he asked for another bank transfer to another "Contractor". That's when it registered it was a scam after asking a mutual friend. (sneaky as they ask you to replace your original Friend's phone number as he "LOST" his PHONE. So it is harder to verify with the real friend.) the voice messages might even be using voice Impersonation software as per the voice recorded messages via WhatsApp he Sounded like my friend. End of the day, sent $4000 to the "Contractor" which was lost. Police report was submitted. Posting this to raise awareness.
This lady added me on Instagram and I remember her ig is ccaini13140628, she named herself coco. The chat went on for 3 days and she decided to ask for help with her 2nd job. She asked if i could help her by taking orders from channel. but of course I rejected it because I knew about this scam. We did take it off platform and chat via whatsapp but I didn't take down the phone number before I blocked it. Please beware of the ig. these scammers are everywhere
This person stated that he is my friend "kelvin lau" from Malaysia. Firstly, he was quite reluctant to give me his name when I asked him for it. he keep saying "you don't remember my voice?", I kept asking for his name and I told him that I don't care about his voice. after that, when I exposed him that I do not know any person named "kelvin lau" from Malaysia. he immediately hung up the call. Just beware of this kind of call even if it's your existing friends, get hold of the full details before doing anything.
Got a call from 81762768 and claims to be my friend who had lost his number. sounded Malaysian. but he refuses to tell me his name. says that he will whatsapp me but never did.
The person called me and know my name. He said that he's changed his number. I asked "Who are you?" and he replied "Wah, you are very bad, forgot about me." I asked again "Who are you?" and he hanged up.
I was matched with a lady by the name of jennifer through tinder. After a short chat, we decided to take it off platform and chat via whatsapp. The chat was pleasant for 3 days. She would try to sent photos of her food, lunch and dinner and ask you daily what are you doing and what are you eating. Then she would also ask you to take photo of your food to send her back. She would also act like a malaysian and say where her hometown is if you ask. Her photos on tinder also looks too good to be true, it seems like it was taken from other girls profile. She had describe herself as a person with social anxiety but was able to engage in good conversation which made it a little suspicious from the start. She would then send goodnight message and good morning. She also mentioned that she work in retail from 10am-8pm Until she decided to ask for help with her 2nd job on 30 nov 2022 at 9.29pm. She asked if i could help her by taking orders from Mytheresa. Singapore quoting her name as a recommender so that she could sleep earlier as she had a long day of work. I felt something was not right, so i tried doing a small research on this particular person and there wasn't any social media of her. I also used mobile phone reverse search to find out which provider and owner of that number was and there wasn't any name linked to the phone number, which made it more suspicious because if you were to try out a few of your friend's number it would show up their name. I immediately told her that i wasn't going to help her and she stopped replying to me, which is obvious enough that it is a scam sign. Would like to warn people not to believe such job offers or helped an online friend to carry out jobs. Especially just knowing a date for 3 days and asking to help her purchase things without meeting them in the first place is huge risk involved as scammer would always try avoid meeting you in person. Luckily for me i was always wary of online scams, as the rise of internet scams due to our digital era.
Received an unknown call without the '+'. He called out my name and said this is his new number. I asked him who he is, he says he is my long time friend and asked me to guess. I asked again who he is, he questioned me saying why i can't even recognize his voice. he say he will text me and hung up. I tried to called the number back and it went straight to the voicemail. few of my friends had encountered such a call when i checked with them, one of them almost transferred money to the unknown caller which he made a police report.

This is another job scam story. They will request for a screenshot of the product and request you to transfer the money to an account and then refund. The amount will keep increasing and may double, resulting you to keep transferring more and more.
The scammer told me that he was calling from Singtel and mentioned that my wifi has been hacked, with more than 6 to 7 people using it. He told me to get on my device so that he can help me resolve this issue. I didn't give out any information and did not allow him any access to my device. Other details about the scammer: - Has a strong Indian accent, trying hard to disguise it with a poor American accent. - His last name is Watson, I don't remember his first name, could be John. - Had my email address, I told him to email me so I can gather more evidence, but I have not received an email yet.
They use a "earn easy money" deal to scam people of their money. For this, they tried getting people to register on their website to "give reviews" to shows. Honestly it's just to make you think you're earning money. Then, once you run out of tasks, they'll make you pay a deposit to earn more tasks. https://airqie?.com (Note: Scam website)
I was contacted over carousell message by someone asking to buy nintendo switch storage box via email instead of carousell. When i sent this person an email, he claimed that he wanted the item delivered to malaysia and that he would pay via paypal or bank transfer. After providing him a quote for postage and payment methods i accepted, he said that he would do a bank transfer. A day later he sent me an email saying the bank transfer was complete and to check my email for the confirmation, however the email stated his bank needed proof of postage to release the funds. I checked the confirmation email he said citibank sent - not only did the email look fishy (font was in purple, no citibank branding, very strangely worded) the email address was also not from citibank (transferoffice@usa.com) hence i immediately suspected it was fake. Also thought it was strange why i had to prove the item was shipped before funds were released. I googled the email address transferoffice@usa.com and found similar stories here about the same scammer using the same name (anthony p) which confirmed to me that this was fraudulent. I wrote back to the scammer telling him that he was a scammer and reported to police. All i got in response was “??" over email. Have also reported his account to carousell. Stay safe and deal via carousell only.
Person added me on instagram and started messaging. moved to Whatsapp, then asked for help with creating "sales" data with luisaviaroma's affiliate link.

Got a call from 82135611 who sounded like a Malaysian male. He knew my name but refused to give me his name. He kept insisting that i know him and i guess his identity. He spoke in Malay saying his phone got lost in JB and this is his new number. He told me to save his new number and then said he had an incoming call before he hung up. He then followed up with a Whatsapp msg asking me to save the new number. I have since blocked the number on my phone and Whatsapp.
I received sms from LTA, asking me to click on the link stated ýou have a bill that will be overdue and incur a penalty .
I received a robocall from OCBC bank. The voice was the same, the wait time music was the same, everything was the same — but the a phone number was a strange +65 sg number. The robocall asked me to confirm a payment for s$4218.50 (something like that), and i did not approve it. My call immediately went to a call center where the gentleman knew my full name (he gave 0 details). He informed that he was an OCBC staff. He asked me for my fin/nric #. I gave it to him. He thanked me. I asked him again what the payment was about … And he hung up. I called him back and the starbub number was disconnected. I realised that it was a scam when I called up the real OCBC hotline to enquire.
Similar encounter as the following stories: https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-06Jul2022183035PM https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-02Sep2021120520PM https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-06Aug2020120421PMFirst call received on 16 oct 2022 (private number) to inform that her company is hosting an in orchard road on 22 oct 2022. Gave her my surname in mandarin and ended the call. Did not attend the mentioned event. Subsequent call (private number) received on 16 nov 2022, the caller mentioned that I did the survey on 16 oct 2022 so i was entitled to the lucky draw. She mentioned that i had won the 3rd prize worth hkd500,000. She also mentioned that since i did not attend the event on 22 oct, they cannot verify my particular to receive the prize. The next thing, she requested for my personal particular, bank account and other information so that she can submit to the council for the claim of the prize. Realizing she need bank account number from me, i told her i am not interested in the prize and they can give it to the next person in line as she mentioned there are still people waiting in line for the prize. She said that she cannot make the decision and she hope that i would reconsider. After mentioning one more time that i am not interested in the prize, she sound pissed and say she will let me think on it again. After the call, went online and search for information. Found similar experiences in scamalert.sg. Seems like they did not even put in the effort to tweak the story a bit and everything is so similar. Hopefully will not get follow up call (mentioned in other experiences) from them again. Just sharing this incident to bring awareness and be alert when stranger ask for banking details.
i was trying to sell a children pants in Carousell. this person contacted me, he/she used a Malay couple picture. He said he would make payment first. then say i will receive a sms of a link to receive the fund by Carousell. he asked for my mobile number. immediately after he sent me a link by sender name of 'qsms' with a link https://cuti.cc/mMwza. the link ask for credit card number details and card balance. then the bubble message ask me to key in the otp. after a few minutes i received an otp of a transaction and then email of someone trying to add my card number to apple pay. then I realised i was about to be scammed. i remember the link also ask for my bank user id and password.

I received an SMS on 11th November indicating that I have a LTA overdue fine. on clicking the link it took me to a site which very much resembled one motoring site indicating that i have 5.36 Sgd fine and the site required my my credit card details. I started to fill in the details but got suspicious because it did not give me any other options. I did not complete my transaction. Later, I checked online on the official site and realised there wasn't any fine against me and it was a scam.
Nowadays most scam calls are starting to have no + prefix, everything is same as any call you will receive from a local number. Of all the local numbers I picked up, 1)moh 2)bank account issues are most common.

I lost $4K TO A JOB scam. a girl named "Hannah" approached me on telegram saying to rate/review hotels. IT'S a very simple interface and the website links to airbnb. so just complete 32 ratings and they will send the commission to you. they also did create a group to make it more CREDIBLE where EVERY DAY they will send how much they earn in the group. i tried to pm one of the MEMBERS in the group but no reply up till now. The very first time when i completed 32 ratings, they sent $11 to me. The next day they will ask to deposit $110 to match the data in the system or so. (cant rmb what she said) she assured after 32 ratings ill be able to redeem back my deposit and COMMISSION. however, when completing the 32 ratings, i got a negative amount in my balance and I had to deposit more so i can get back my $110. It started from a few HUNDRED, then to a few thousand. After reading the news then i realize its all a scam. Apparently, i called the number they provided to paynow, AND all of the 'merchants' phone numbers are invalid.
4th Nov I saw the adv. online about low interest rate moneylender. I went on to click on the link and they asked me for my personal information such as NRIC, CPF contributions, bank statements, and even photo of me. Then they sent me a contract to sign. After that, he asekd me to transfer total $5000 for the admin and 'MAS' fees. Then, only could they disburse the funds to me. I transferred the funds over but I was told that I did the process wrongly. I have sent couple of times and found it fishy so thought to cancel the contract to cancel the whole thing. After getting the acc number and ref i transfer to them then he said i put it wrong cannot put that ref no should put my acc no if not the system cannot capture. I am very angry then i cut their phone off and report to police. The next thing that happened was that they used my identity to take the loan from unlicensed money lender. I quickly file the report to bank and close the account. The investigations and episode still ongoing
I received a call from 8751-7932 at 2pm. The caller on the other end claimed to be from UOB Bank. She informed me that an amount of $4,000 was debited from my account. I hung up the call immediately and blocked the number as it was clearly a scam call.
Beware emails coming from - rcarry@optonline.net I received an urgent email from the scammer. The person spoofed my boss's name (with a personal email address- rcarry@optonline.net), sent to my work email address with my name addressed. They made an urgent request for me to purchase apple $600 gift card within 10-20 mins. Once purchase was completed, I sent them a screenshot of the gift card with redemption code. They sent me another email for a $900 purchase for apple store gift card. I realised that things were amiss and filed a police report.
There is a similar scam alert from someone who shared his/her story here too. Its exactly the same. I received a call from a number 8057 6284 (+65 prefix was not present). The caller was a male and spoke in Mandarin with a Malaysian accent. He started by saying that he changed his handphone number so his purpose of the call is to update me about it. Then i know who is he. He said you guess la. i replied no, i don’t know. He said u think harder la. i repeated at least 2 times that i really don’t know who are you, and maybe he called the wrong number. Again, He REMAINED INSISTENT THAT WE KNEW EACH OTHER and went on saying YOU DON'T REMEMBER? We always talked on the phone one! You think harder la! Throughout the call, HE REFUSED TO REVEAL HIS NAME AND KEPT PROMPTING ME TO GUESS and guess. i refused to give him any name after umpteen times of “you guess who am i la, you think harder, we speak before.” so he said “i have another incoming call” and he hung up immediately.

Received a call from this number +6588263420, informing me that I got a UOB credit card transaction of $4830, if unauthorised - selection option 2. After selecting the option, I spoke to this guy who sounded like a Chinese male in 30/40s and talked like a local with typing noise in background - he asked for my name and kept asking if i have made this transaction - a uob gold card, asked for my name and ic to verify.I asked for details, since he had my name and ic details - where i applied it as I didn’t recall having this card - and no impression of any gold card from any bak for teh longest time - he informed i walked into Tampines UOB branch and made the application on 25 oct 2022- i realise its a scam - as i have not been in Tampines since 2019 and not stepped into a uob branch anytime this year. On hearing my suspicions, he offer to connect me to cantonnment polic branch - i declined and hang up.The whole call sounded ridiculous and using scare tactics to confuse and instil fear. Beware, guys!
"She" connected with me via photography account on Instagram and asked to add each other on WhatsApp. While i found it suspicious as her Instagram account only had 10 posts made august this year and "her" first few messages to me were "I want to be a pretty girl" and "could you help me to take some portraits". I thought it was interesting to play along with "her" nonsense anyway. "she" was very pro-active in texting me on WhatsApp (which was annoying) and claimed that "she" is working at a coffee chain in ion orchard while doing a part time for Chanel at night. 2 days after we added each other on WhatsApp, "she" claimed that she is tired and that "her" eyes hurt a lot. "she" asked if i could help her to run some errands on "her" behalf. It was at this moment when i received a contact from her, which "she" claimed to be Chanel customer service. Then the "cs" will send a message that looks like this (i would like to refer your attention to point 3): "dear customer: hello: your single task order has been requested this task is 1 this task is randomly assigned by the system. If there is no operation within 12 hours after the task is dispatched, it will be automatically canceled, but it is not allowed to exit during the execution of the task!

Incoming scam has no + prefixCaller Stated he was from MOH and asked why did I use my number and to send fake news regarding covid19 in China. I asked him what number, he muttered a set of number, I told him i did not travel to China in the past 2 years, he ask then why this number is register under your details. I replied I do not know. And what do you want me to do now? He replied nothing just that this will affect your application of anything in China. I told him i do not intend to apply for anything in china.

On 7 Nov, i received a phone call from this number 80468982. As there was no “+65 prefix” on the phone number, i picked up the call. The call appeared to be diverting from a machine and no one speaks for about 5 secs. Then a lady by the name of anna introduced herself and asked if i am so and so (yes, she called me by my full name). I asked her where she from and she said she is from ministry of communications. And she said that my phone number was involved in a series of illegal activities. She instructed me to follow her instructions or else my phone number will be deactivated in 1 hour. I told her i will report to the police and verify this with the police. The caller anna spoke in Mandarin only and with a strong malaysian accent.
I was introduced to a job whereby you like the Youtube video and you were paid. Then if you are keen to make more money, you have pumped in more money. It went on until I made a mistake while doing what the “teacher“ asked me to follow. To repair the mistake, i have to put more money to recover. Luckily, the bank stopped the transaction. They told me it was a scam. If not, i would have lost $10000. I paid $4000 to learn this lesson. It all voices down to the word “greed” if I have not been attracted to the money earned, I would not have been scammed.
Caller from a handphone number 80473910 without +65 in front. Caller spoke in Mandarin and said he was calling from MOH i asked him 'who are you' in mandarin and he responded in Mandarin, said, "I am calling from MOH" and wanted to reconfirm my surname in Mandarin. he did not reply to my question for his name identity except that he is from MOH. This was an obviously a scam call and I hung up. Good to share that they are now not using country code prefix +xx in front of handphone number.
Jenny approached me in telegram and asked if I would want a part time job. I said I am open to take a look. She got another lady, Lacy to contact me. She insisted that I will be paid at least 60 dollars per hour just by rating apps. I had to download an app . I did not take up her offer and she texted me often, asking me to take up the JOB and enticing me with offers. Her number is 9164562?. Pls be careful if she approaches you.
This guy with a Malaysian accent speaking in Chinese just called me. Able to address me by my name but declined to share who he was. He just kept asking me to guess who he is and how come I cannot recognise his voice, all in a joking manner. But I denied that that was my name, because by now I was sure he is a scammer that got my contact details via illegitimate means. He was taken aback to hear me deny that was my name and then he said he will check and call me back. I think he realised I know he is not anyone I know.
Phishing scam: Have received a call, claimed to be from a bank that they needed to verify on a $48XX transaction on the card number ending xx11. i press 1 for details. FEELING A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS AS IT WAS FROM A +65 NUMBER and requesting for id number, I ask the caller to make a call back using the direct bank number to confirm. Then i hang up the call. Made a phone call to the bank (Note: Find the official number from the bank's website or app) and found that there was no such transaction and it was all a scam. I felt more relief after checking more details. I hope to share this encounter and spread the awareness of new scam tactics.
Received a call claiming from singtel technical team asking if i have been experiencing slow internet connection for the past few days. the person had a thick indian accent. if you replied yes, then they will claim it is due to foreign internet access to the router which is slowing down. they will then ask you to type in "windows+R" to run the "CMD" command then they will tell you to type in "netstat" and see the associated "established" connections then they will ask to type in "assoc" to verify the CLSID. he could recite with no error. then he will transfer to his "network engineer" colleague and have him take over. INSTEAD OF DIRECTING YOU TO THE ROUTER IP ADDRESS to make any changes. the person will ask you to open chrome and type in "91198.org" and key in a code which he will tell you. i did not do it and told him cannot connect. i further asked him to get the technician down to check instead of doing remote access. he keep saying if i do not do this now, my internet access would be compromised. ignore this please and hang up the call.
So the scammer called yesterday to tell me to save his new number because he has recently lost his wallet and phone while buying food.He also said he has already made a police report and that cctv couldn't trace anything. He said he was going to the bank now to settle his bank cards and then to ICA to settle his nric. This morning, the scammer called me again to ask if i could borrow $2,000 to pay for some renovation stuff because his bank card is not ready yet. I rejected and said i don't have that amount. He then asked how much do i have on hand, to which i told him its inconvenient for me to lend anyone money due to my job nature. After that the scammer dropped the call without saying anything else.
A scammer sent me an SMS just now, allegedly from Singpost, claiming that "you have a package returned to the forwarding centre, please click www.slngpost.top the updated information to complete the delivery, and pay 2.21sgd postage". Apart from the poor grammar, the main red flag was the mis-spelling of singpost (although it was all lower case, and on my phone, so the substitution of "l" for "i" was not so obvious) and non-".com" site address.
I received this email in my mailbox about a month ago. I did not click on the link or fall for the scam. Here to share how to identify one possible phishing email. 1) Poor command of English within the email 2) Hover cursor on the provided link but do not click on it. 3) A dubious website notification appear at the bottom of the email which is of a totally different website from the link that was given in the email. I attached a photo for easy reference. stay safe. If something is too good to be true, it is probably not true.
I received a call yesterday afternoon from a 'friend' telling me that he had changed his number. The name he said happened to be the same as my friend's. Then, this morning this scammer called me again to ask me if I could lend him $3k to pay supplier for his urgent goods, Then, I noticed that something isn't right and I declined the request by telling him that I don't have enough money. He then asked for a lower loan amount, which I still declined. I then thought of calling my friend at his 'old number' to confirm that it was indeed him who have been calling me and then I realised that it was all a scam and the real person didn't call me.
I received a call saying this was UOB and they want to approve a transaction of $3863 from my card. But I didn't apply any card. Then they said that to check. That guy took my ic number and checked saying a card was applied under my name on 26 sep 2022. Issued on 7th October 2022. But I didn't apply any. He said there is another transaction made. $8999. Apple store. I panicked. So he said make a complain to commercial affairs department. And he transferred my call. That guy wanted to verify my details. But he sounded suspicious. So I questioned him his name and he took some time to answer.. Then I cut the call. And went to website to call the actual CAD and I was advised to register my complaints here. I didn't make any purchase.
I received a call from 8046 3841 and another from 80468658. when i answered the call, it was a ringing tone as if the call was diverting to another line. At first it was a man who answered my call, asking me if I was so and so. After my confirmation, he proceeded to speak in malaysian accent Mandarin. I told him to speak english and he still spoke in mandarin, Then told me that they have documents indicating that I had purchased unauthorized covid-19 medicines. I immediately lost my temper and gave him a scolding back in mandarin vulgarities because i knew he was a scammer. hang up and don't waste your time to talk to these scums. I am adding this info to this case, as I noticed another case on this site which is exactly the same as mine. it is getting worrisome because i don't know how they got to know my full name and phone number.

I received another call from 8046 6961. Again, when i answered the call, it was a ringing tone as if the call was diverting to another line. (i have received one from 8154 2450 on 28/10/2022). At first it was a man who answered my call, asking me if I was so and so. After my confirmation, he proceeded to speak in Mandarin. I told him to speak english and another person spoke to me, a woman, in English. She, again asking me if I was so and so. Then told me that they have documents indicating that I had purchased unauthorized covid-19 medicines and demanded that I explained why I haven’t informed MOH. I told them that I have reported this matter to the police. However, the callers were undeterred and asked me to check with MOH if I do not believe them. So, I told them i had also reported this to MOH. Next, she said, "ok bye" and hung up. I am adding this info to this case as this time, they really did used my full name.

Started off by liking youtube videos - introduced by a receptionist named helen. From youtube tasks, it then became a prepaid task where you need to put in money. you will then be introduced to frank, the “teacher”. lots of other participants on telegram chat “putting in” money. the amount grew from as small as $58 to $30k over, only then i realised i have been scammed for almost $9k.
Contacted by eva phang &amp; William Tan that they have freelance jobs for me that requires me to rate the app via a platForm - gosstech and told me to join a whatsapp group. Everybody was making money; people sharing experiences and showing amount that they made By rating apps. The task is to click 40 ratings and I am able to earn money out from it. There will be basic pay of $2200 and incentives out from the task. The amount was small and returns were cashed out immediately when i completed the tasks. However, the amount gets bigger over time and left me with choice to keep putting money because I wanted to get back what I have pumped in which is 32k in total. The amount has gotten too big that is out of my means so I didn’t proceed further. I got scammed because I'm not able to cash out unless i completed the latest amount which is 51k.
An email was sent to me informing me that their billing team was unable to debit my nominated card due to a missing information on my payment details. Called Singtel to verify and was told that they did not send out any email to me today.
Received a call from a "Benny chong" claiming that he was from the 'Ministry of health" and he mentioned that I did not have any vaccination status . I cut him off by asking for his details with ministry of health due to the increase in scam calls. He called from mobile 92454659 He claimed his moh no. 63231715
Please take note that the scammers are no longer just Mandarin speaking, they have gotten people that speaks better English to do the calls. Please alert your loved ones and friends to this scam tactic!
Realized too late it was a Fake Friend Call Impersonation scam. Scammer called me by voice, knew my name. When pressed to stop making me guess who, he quoted a name i knew and said he was a polytechnic classmate. Claimed that he lost his device and changed number, wanted me to add to whatsapp. Few days later, over Whatsapp, claimed he had problems with resetting dongle. Directed him to contact bank. Called back again, still same problem, has a payment to make to contractor today, asked to help to pay 800 to contractor's bank account. Once again confirmed his name. Payment made via internet banking, received a voice mail promising the return of funds at 4pm, "after meeting, will head to bank and settle". Return of funds never occurred. The next day, when questioned about bank issues, the whatsapp chat was promptly deleted. Police report made.
Received a regular phone call from 80528663. No '+65' or '+' prefix. Robocall voice message. Male with a Singaporean accent stating he is from ministry of health trying to contact me and to press 1 for English etc. I ended the call as its very clearly not MOH and sounds like a scam. While nothing was lost, I hope to share the encounter with netizens as this is not a regular international spoofed call (no + prefix), public need to be aware of such tactics.
I was contacted by Justin via whatsapp asking if i was looking for a job on 21/9/22. He knew my name. When I asked how he got my contact details he said it was through his HR via fastjobs/jobstreet. Similar job scam tactic used - asked for likes on Youtube but mine was on Tiktok. I lost more than $82000 in a day.
Unknown caller was able to address me by my English name correctly and told me he is my friend and have changed phone number. Insisted that I guess his name but didn't tell me his name, and eventually asked me to transfer him money as he is stuck overseas in need. Both voice sounded like the same Chinese guy and he called me using two different numbers in a month!
Scammer called up and addressed me correctly by name. He told me that he lost his phone while eating in JB and hence wanted to let me know his new hp number. he has a Malaysian accent and very deep voice which does not sound like anybody I know at all but he sounded very friendly. He just keep insisting that I should know who he is and was upset that I forget about him . afterwhich, he mentioned that he will WhatsApp me shortly and that I will recognize based on his profile picture. However i still did not recognize him so after I opened his message, i reported and blocked him immediately. He did mention my friend's name but his voice and his picture did not even look like my friend at all.
Don't learn from me. If your online date ask for money, you must know it is never a good thing, there are options like a license moneylender or a bank, they can lend them money or if they ask you want to earn good money with commission through online it is alway a scam, no official business will ever do trading online using internet banking. The scammer can also use a business number to do scams, so it make them look legit. This is what i learn after getting scam half way. The scammer have many banking accounts to spare so they will not get flag out, they don't use posb/dbs as the bank will flag out accounts that are reported as scam. They are alway trying to help you, listen to them. The rule is very simple for everyone to follow:1) if they claim they are from a company look up the company and ask/message them is there such a thing. There is no harm in asking, asking is free.2) you can alway questions the people you are dealing with by asking more details of the things that you are required to do, they will explain it but never in full details so just ask them, if they got triggered by what you ask them you must know this is a red-flagged, stop what you are doing.3) you can make friend with people online by as long as it involves money stay away from them, it is not worth to throw your money to people like them.4) if you think you are half way into the scam immediately either export all the messages from the chat to save as evidence or screen record the chat. You will need it when you do police report. Evidence is very important for investigation.5) do not panic, as panicking will not get your money back try to make excuse to ask them to return if they are kind enough to do so.
Scammer (m1 phone number 98774643) called my handphone stating that i owed money to “MOH”. Scammer cannot speak English and asked in mandarin. Put down the phone immediately once I spoke in English. Probably targeting Chinese people to scam money.
I have been approached by staff claiming to be agents from SolarWinds Singapore. The contact was made today via WhatsApp text from these numbers (+65 88245483 and +60 11-2726 9844). Over the conversation, I was introduced to a job offer that required me to be a user of an application developed by SolarWinds. The links provided to me to sign up for the application are as follows: (www.solarwinds-app.com; www.solarwinds-evolve.com). According to the instructions given, to be a user, I would first need to make a deposit using my bank account to conduct transactions to purchase generic applications. After the purchase is completed, the agents promised that a certain amount of returns will be provided by the SolarWinds application.
I received a text message saying failed delivery attempt for parcel with a tracking number and a web link that directs to page that looks like Singpost with logo of Singpost. I suspect it to be a scam as i did not order anything. so i use a web browser to key in the url in the sms. the page was asking for payment with credit card info, if not parcel will be withheld and there is no option to pick-up from post office or redelivery. I rechecked the website and it looks different so I confirmed it is a scam as it has the telltale signs of a scam.
I got to know this person via tinder. After a week of chatting she tells me there is an investment scheme with jp morgan with good returns. She then give me a link to ask me to install on my phone here http://MOGEN-VIP.COM [Note: Do not click. Potential fake website]. The good thing i did not fall for this but i want to share this story to prevent others from falling into this scam.
I fell prey to a loan scam after responding to a text message offering loans. Happened that I needed to funds for my bakery business. Contacted them and given my details, was told i can get a loan of $80000. At first I need to transfer $2000 to open a file, later they ask for admin fee of $3500. After paying just wait for approval. Waited for 5 days they finally send me an agreement that i have to make a 3 months upfront for the loan, that is another $12000. Stupidly i believed them till they ask me for the release clause $20000. When I wanted to cancel the loan and get back my money, they ask me for the cancellation fee. The worst part is without getting a single cent, they start to threaten me if did not oay the cancellation fee I will hafe to serve the loan. They even threatened will do something yo my address, in fact they really did came and chian locked my gate. They said if i report to police, they will next burn the house. This just happened 2 weeks ago.
caller (SOUNDED LIKE A MALAYSIAN CHINESE) addressing me by my name, said that he had changed his number and to contact him using this number moving forward. I asked him who he was a few times but he refused to say his name, just kept saying things like "we know each other for so long you don't remember who i am?". I hung up after he repeatedly refused to identify himself.
I met ‘Cynthia’ through tinder and she was a verified account. Shortly after she asked to bring conversation to WhatsApp. She is very good at talking and used many ways to convince that she is a true person with no other social media acct but verified by tinder. *just a tip to everyone it is very easy to buy a verified tinder acct online. Through many occasions she always tried to bring topic back to helping her with a hermes website to transfer money which will be returned for fake review. Eg, saying she was sick and needed help, otherwise will get penalty. I didn't fall for it as I have read about such things before. So just a cautionary note to ppl to beware of such scams.
Job scam on telegram. Pretended to promote the airline company and promoting their air ticket, asked to complete 32 ratings on their platform to get a commission from the trial fund account. Be careful as scammers are misusing legitimate companies' name to cheat.

Met this person on the bumble app and he was a verified profile. We chatted on Telegram for a while. we even spoke over the phone through telegram call. He spoke about how he was cheated by his ex 4 years ago, how he has been working very hard and how he has become successful with the help of his CEO through some private investment invitation. He also gave some back story of meeting scammers on the dating apps. One day, he said he had to go KL for a month as the business manager there was on leave. 2 weeks later, he says he got the invitation code from his boss and got upset when I declined to participate. I was pressured to participate and did as he said. He gave me a link to the website and personal information had to be keyed in. he also persuaded me to try the investment and guaranteed that I would get my money back. I really did get my money and profits back. He asked about the next investment which I did not participate. I was lucky not to have suffered any monetary loss but I did lose my personal information. now I have to constantly be aware of my bank transactions. I have made a police report on this.
I received an automated message and it said i had made a credit card purchase of $4839 with card ending 1183. When i pressed to talk to the operator , the person claimed to be thomas chan from uob saying i opened a UOB visa gold card at tampines branch on the 26th of September 2022 . he asked for my full name and i/c number and later said that I should make a police report and that someone was using my identity. He said that he could connect me to police directly and i was connected to a person claiming to be inspector lee. This is where it all got weird and i was like a zombie when this person was saying my name appeared in some money laundering scheme by a lady named "serena". this was on the whatsapp platform with the number +6581963900 and it says reporting platform 28. i shared my i/c details taking pictures front and back and also some basic information about my family &amp; the banks I used. Eventually he claimed to have spoken to cid &amp; a senior police inspector Cheong and claimed that i was cleared and not to share any information on what we spoke about to anyone. however i said that i have to check with my lawyer and bank rm about this fraudulent transaction and he said okay.i only realized that i was scammed when he deleted his photo id.
I was been scammed yesterday 16 Oct 2022. I posted in Carousel to sell my escooter and sell off below market value. The money is not for personnel benefit but to donate the money to Charity which i have doing it every week without fail. (Giving Asia) I posted e scooter there is a person interested for the escooter, and commented he/she had transfer the money to "Carospay" and i need to register to get the money. 140 SGD As I just return from Singapore last year, this was new to me, hence I proceeded to register with my bank user ID, password, OTP. However i found the website is fishy and it not DBS link, therefore i immediately call the bank to block it at 10 AM Bank inform me everything is still safe and requested me to re-register again, hence i believe everything is over. but to my horror at 15:24 i saw there is a transfer of 2000SGD to a person HENRY WONG JIAN LING (Mobile ending 3507) i call the bank again to block everything and make a police report immediately at 7pm
He approached me at first through LinkedIn on july 2022, he said he is from us, we started to chat with a 12 hrs time difference, assuming he is really from us. We did voice call as well but never video call. I didn’t suspect much. He mentioned he is coming to Malaysia for a contract job, on last week of august, he said he needed my help to transfer money to Malaysia company and use my sg account, said that it would be faster for them to receive rather than he Giro from us. To cut it short, i didn’t realized that I have been fooled by this scammer, helping him for money laundry, i didn’t lose any money, but my bank account been freeze until now and it is still under interrogation. And of course, this guy is nowhere to be found and contact. To girls out there, please be careful, he probably targeting on women who has sg bank account to help him transfer the money.
Scammer called up and addressed me correctly by name. told me that he lost his phone while eating in JB and hence wanted to let me know his new hp no. he has a Malaysian accent, sounded very friendly but I do not RECOGNISE his voice. I kept asking who he is but he just asked me to guess. i gave a random name 'lucas' and he immediately said it's him. asked me to save his new number and he will WhatsApp me shortly. He did send a message on WhatsApp which i reported and blocked immediately.
The call was from a number +65 8351 3207. It was an automated message which stated that there is a pending transaction on my credit card with UOB. Press 1 to approve and press 2 to speak with a customer service officer. I pressed 2. This next part is the most scary part cause the person on the other line is confirmed a Singaporean with a nice voice who sounds very believable to be a customer service officer. I asked her how I can verify that this call is in fact from UOB. She gave me her full name, and also volunteered to give me her staff ID. She also gave me UOB main hotline to call in case I prefer to do that. She then proceeded to ask me to verify my details. I gave her my full name and contact number but when she asked me for my IC number, that was when I stopped and told her I can't do that. I asked if I can just give her the last four digits of my IC and she said she needed my full IC number to proceed. This was when I stopped the call and said I will call the main line instead. The reason I am making this report is that this is extremely believable and the fact that the person on the other line is a Singaporeans is scary and I believe many Singaporeans will fall for this one.
Instead of the usual +65 for the scam calls, I had recently received a scam call from MOH saying "THis is a notice from MOH regarding your missing documentation...etcc" and it is from this LOCAL number 89375102 (WITHOUT +65) in front. I hanged up the call and called back the same number, only to get a dead tone.. FYI. Sad that now the scammers are figuring out how to prevent using the +65 in front.
someone from KRDS Digital whatsapp me asking me if I want to make some money. there are 25 tasks I need to do. mostly to launch Instagram and like or follow. eack taske gives $5. however after a few tasks they ask me to deposit some money to get back more money through some Prepaid task. (i.e. put in $60 get back $90 in 15 mins). of course i did not do it... then they cut my task from $5 to $2/task since i did not complete the prepaid task. After scammers realised that they couldn't fool me, I got kicked out of that group.
Out of nowhere, I received a WhatsApp chat asking if i am looking for a job. I answered just browsing around. Then he replied telling you the job required clicking on the like of a particular youtube video and then you can join a workgroup on telegram. All I needed to do is like or subscribe to the youtube page and send the screenshot for them to check and after confirmation, they will arrange their finance to pay salary. Pay range 4k to 5k monthly. Well, no money was lost. A check on the company name showing it is a live company and the address was a condo. However i could not find any company contact number thus makes one wonder if someone would impersonate the company staff to scam or if it is a shell company for the scammers? A job posting that re-direct you to a telegram wont be genuine. Just sharing my story.

Met a girl named lily on tinder. She is a Malaysian girl working as a fashion retail staff in sg. We chatted for a few days and she mentioned about her side job that she does at night. The job involves buying some stuff on mytheresa (probably fake website) Knowing that it’s a trap, i told her I am busy and not interested, her attitude changed 180degrees. Just to warn everyone to be careful. Immediately blocked her and no $$ was lost.
Someone called zhenxinli, @lzx910628 suddenly followed me on IG and messaged me. We exchanged some pleasantries and i asked whether i know her from somewhere, but somehow "she" claimed that she is from Malacca and working at a yoga studio in Suntec city. And that she apparently has a part-time job that she does at night at home which was about tallying accounts, which i didn't think much of. After a while she asked if it's ok to move the conversation to WhatsApp and i agreed. We asked about each other and exchanged greetings, she claimed to stay with her older brother and her sister in law. After a few days, she even took photos of her surroundings to show her whipping up some dishes at home and watching ndp. She then asked if i am interested in helping her with her part time job. I agreed wondering what's so difficult about the part time job. Turns out, she gave me a number to "Chanel" and told me to message them to say that i'm helping her. The message I got told me to take a screenshot of a "Chanel" product, then to transfer $98 to their account. At first, I did receive back the $98+$15 commission then, I proceed to accept the 2nd order, this is where the real scam starts. The 2nd product cost $825. After I transferred to the account like the first order, the person told me to process and transfer another $3300. I asked him why and he said that this order has 5 products, and I only transferred 1/5 of the amount, and so I needed to transfer the balance amount for the remaining 4 items, left 4/5 haven't transfer. When I asked this girl to transfer me $3300 and she refused to. I told her my bank only left $500 so she ask me to transfer $500 to that account and she will help me with the remaining sum. And so I did as I was told and I screenshot and send transfer slip as proof but she didn't respond after that. I am sharing this story to stop the next victim from falling into the scammer's trap.
Michelle (87101050) from “KRDS digital” contacted me out for the blue, offering me a job opportunity to make money online. I had to perform a number of daily 25 missions, majority are to follow instagram creators but their attention is to encourage people to transfer money to a crypto account and make 10% more than the amount that I had earlier “invested”. Michelle invited me to the main telegram group, then a receptionist (receptionist Kelly 01) will be assigned to me followed by a so-called supervisor (supervisor-sherry 01) for crypto "work" (cayproab.cc). Everyone in those groups could be members of scammers, investing seems so easy for them, $300 one day and $33,000 on another. I have sensed something amiss, so decided to share my story here to warn others.
Scammer called, knew my name and asked if I know who he is. He sounded like an acquaintance (Malaysian who service our aircon) so I asked if he was "so and so". He said YES! and went on to share the story how he lost his phone and wallet (few times). Hence, he is changing number and wants me to save it. He went on to ask if I was free on Saturday, and invited me to his new cafe opening. I asked if he will invite my mom and he said he definitely contact my mom and we ended the call. Next day, he called me twice and kept texting me to call him back. I then verify through the original number of this acquaintance and realised it's scam. Thankfully nothing was lost. on hindsight, it is best to verify the caller's identify no matter what.
Someone contacted me on whatsapp to offer a quick pay job by following tiktok accounts. i was then invited to a telegram group, then I found out besides the so-called job to follow tiktok accounts, they also offered some fixed deposit investment schemes like putting in $192 to get $252. little did i know that they required more than just $192 because there were additional steps required before you can claim the amount. I went on to the second step and third and fourth step because the person told me if I didn't follow through, I would lose all of my money. Until the amount become so huge that i start to suspect this is a scam, i decided to stop. Beware, guys!
Job to follow tiktok accounts turned out to be a fake 1) I received a whatsapp message from +65 8154 9370 named 'ivy’, a recruiter at upsize media pte. Ltd'. And it’s a social media hype job. All i needed to do is to follow the tiktok accounts given in the tasks and will be paid. 2) Told me to connect with another person on telegram - receptionist-anna. Anna added me to a mission group chat and post 25 missions in a day. She's also in-charge of paying me for every few missions i completed. In between these missions, there are prepaid tasks where money is involved. I did not start the prepaid missions on the first day. 2) each day i completed the tiktok following job but just left the prepaid job where i must pay them certain amount. 3) even if you agree to do prepaid job, they guide to suspicious website http://983y4.com and you need to do some clicks and real issue start where you need to give you back account details to withdraw the commissions. 4) every day they reduce the commissions if you don’t do prepaid jobs. Here are the telegram handles @anna187691 work group 177
I received a phone call today and the person knew my name from the start, mentioning we were friends and just spoke a few days back. I kept asking him for his name but he refused to say but mentioned will Whatsapp me. He never Whatsapp-ed. did not know what he asked from me after as I hung up the phone after he refused to say his name when asked on multiple occasions.
Got a call from 8193 5672. Claimed that he's a friend of mine who lost his mobile. Claimed that I would recognize his voice which i don't. Insisted that he was a friend of mine. Say will send me photo via Whatsapp which he never did.
I was looking for a loan of 30k. I got a message from a number about a loan and at that time i was interested. So i briefly when to search the company and and check if is listed and it is. Btw the company name is “se investment pte ltd” so after i saw the company name in the list i assume it was legit. So this person name charles told me i need to make to deposits first to open a file and account which is 3500 each. So the first transaction i did i wrote down his name in it “to : Charles” after a while he said that money got stuck because of me writing his name and in order for the loan to process and the refund to be make I needed to transfer him another 7000 and put the initial “se” for it to go thru. So stupid me believe him and I did what he said. After transferring 7000 to him he said we got another problem. Mas hold on the money and i need to pay another 5500 for the release clause. After he said that i start to feel fishy so i didn’t transfer him and i keep ask him to help me out but he insist he can’t and i need to pay the release claus for the loan and refund to be process which I didn’t because it doesnt make sense. I went to report to the police straight away. It’s my first time and yea they show me the invoice from the company and stupid me believe.
A girl @aisyah_angel_5534 suddenly followed me on instagram. Her intro, post and followers looks normal so i accepted. We started chat and then our chat was directed to whatsapp (+6581737314). We turned out to have similar background. She even sent me her own pic, the food she was eating and working pic. She works as a store manager in a skincare company at orchard during daytime and works part-time for chanel to create data to boost sales. After some days, she said she couldn't sleep well and her eyes are pain. Asked me to help her completing some of her part-time job task so she can sleep earlier. I agreed. She sent me a whatsapp no. (+6591336261), said is 'chanel online customer service' and asked me message them saying i am helping her. They started sending me the 'task'. First, a real chanel product link was sent. I was asked to take a screenshot for them to confirm. Later they sent an accout number and mobile no. (which belongs to some weird malay name) for me to transfer/paynow. First order $90, i sent and after a while, returned $105 ($10 newcomer bonus + 5% of product price). Second order $530, i sent and returned $556. They wrote that completed 3 orders has $50 bonus (clearly, first two are the bait). Third order, amount started to become 5k+ (the real deal comes). The girl was still sharing her experience to make it convincing, like orders more than 5k are rare and i was lucky etc. She got a 9k order previously and got nice bonus. 5k+ was too much. She said can ask for changing. They changed to a 3k product. I just transfer but didnt notice the order quantity this time is '3'!! I was asked to pay for the remaining two. I was so shocked and asked her for rescue. She said is ok to pay in ringgit too. They then sent me a malaysia bank account to transfer. Luckily bank blocked the transaction. I later tried to pay partial but the sg bank declined it and called me saying it is actually a job scam. I told her and she still tried to convince me by sharing she had similar experiences, told me not to worry. She 'helped' me to pay partial and showed me the screenshot. Think i am too eager to get back my money (the sunk cost) so i stupidly transfer another 1k to 'keep' the order. Part of me even felt guilty like i really owed her money. There is a fine line between kindness and stupidity. I feel so embarrassed, my intention was just to help a 'friend'. She still said that i am a good guy. How sarcastic! Sharing this to remind all of you to stay vigilant and not falling into the same trap. Found some similar stories here also (but seems i am the only stupid one).

First call saying he changed contact number and asked me to update, I asked who are you? He answered, so fast forget about me ah.. jason ah.. i replied which jason? I then shared a name that I knew. The caller then said "yes yes" and asked me to don't forget to update his contact.. the following call, asked me about updating his personal info on bank app.. I kindly helped him how to do it.. the next call.. asked me if I can loan him money for renovation first cos his contractor needed the money.. I honestly told him i have no money!! He kept calling me non stop!! Then I asked the real friend who I knew if that his number had changed, he said no! And I knew its a scam! Be aware.. he changed number very fast!!
I have just got a call from a person with Malaysian accent and claimed that we spoke a few days ago. He kept asking me to guess his name while for some reason he knows mine. After being annoyed, he revealed himself to be "jason". I told him i do not have a friend by that name and i hung up.
I received a Whatsapp video call from this number +1 (920) 390 6813 and the profile picture is the Singapore police force crest. I did not answer the call and blocked the contact but thought i'd report it here.
Instead of the usual +65 for the scam calls, I had recently received a scam call from MOH saying "we have tried to contact you regarding your vaccination status but to no avail, press 1 for....etc" and it is from this LOCAL number 81470523 (WITHOUT +65) in front. FYI
I was searching for my second part time job since Im a student i want to earn extra for transportation to school and my current part time. I came across this site in indeed.com where i can search category of jobs for students and there is this job called avra has high salary around $2k to do some marketing advertisement. when they recruit me, I told them do i need to be interview? Since its my first time doing this kind of "actual" marketing work but when they said no need to and i just need to load this bitcoin website and input the amount of my money with their wallet address they sent to me for so called "job" verification. Since they said the money will be transfer back as refund since the first week, they didnt gave me back and random people transferring money to my bank. I was confused what kind of job is this and I told them is this a scam? they said absolutely not and they became more aggresive till they threaten me to call the police if i didn't do my work properly. Deep down till the end, they betray my by not only refused to give me back my money but the even dared to use my personal information and my name to create bank account from matchmove. Now they are in telegram with the name @hairdreamsg using my name!
Received the usual telegram msg looking for ft/pt food evaluator from a recruiter called linda. I asked for their credentials and linda reply "food &amp; beverage international holdings pte. Ltd. (registration id: 200718722c)". Since i indicated interest, linda said that a colleague will be contacting me for more details and that i can decline in the end. Then linda became a deleted account. The 'next' person contacts me on telegram, moomnchloe (username: @chloee_ly) and further explains the job. Her profile pic is with her 'family', looks normal. Job scope was to view images of a dish and rate it 1-5 stars on their website, each dish will indicate the commission that will be received after 32 evaluations done. Did 32 reviews, put in my paynow number and they do send the indicated commission amt (~$14) to my bank. All seems good. Then the scam thickens, to continue with the next set of 32 reviews, chloe says need to do a "renewal", which requires a deposit of $120 to "customer service" to create "consumption data". Doing this allows you to continue the reviews and gain commission. They promise a renewal bonus everytime you do this. Also, every set of 32 evaluations are said to be $30-40 now. Chloe invites me to a telegram grp of fellow food evaluators (14 ppl), seems v friendly at first with ppl welcoming you and they share random videos. Then someone in the grp asks how to do the 33rd food evaluation and someone replies saying that need to deposit the $120...(same info as what chloe told me). The person is doubtful and asks for more info, all of which is answered by other ppl in the grp. At the same time, chloe also private msg me to ask if i have any issue with the renewal. After i stop replying, another person in the group chat says that he has renewed and sends a screenshot of his commission gains (with "success" indicated beside each transaction). At this time I’ve confirmed that this is a scam. Pretty smart of them to give ppl a taste of the money first then asked for your money. Not sure if this is useful, but here are the telegram usernames of members of the telegram grp: grp name: yums yums team 1) alice liew: @aliceeee97 2) moomnchloe: @chloee_ly 3) joyce: @janice1990lim 4) lim: @lnelsonlim 5) joey wong (no telegram username) 6) adelyn: @adelyn1997 7) andrew (no telegram username) 8) rosnita (no telegram username) 9) weiwei: @weiwei70 10) mohd hakim: @mohdhakim92 11) alan: @alan9011 12) jonathan wong: @jonathan1wong 13) joanna: @joanna1211

I posted his another number to scam shield and block him. and he can still get another number to call. and tried to use the same trick on me again, but it didn't work.

I've received job offer stating that they are recruiting firm. The email didn't look entirely professional but I decided to give it a go and responded to the email. They asked for my age and phone number. I was skeptical and REPLIED anyway that I could be contacted via Telegram. (They asked for my choice of being contacted) After that, they contacted me via WhatsApp despite my request of using telegram. The person named Lianne. Next, they sent an automatic message asking about what job I prefer to have. I was able to select either full time or part time. Then the next question was about asking me if I have tiktok account. It is already a signal that this is not an agency company from the first 2 QUESTIONS, despite the good looking website shown in EMAIL http://www.wisenetasia.cn/ The last observation I had was when I pressed into the WhatsApp business profile of this contact, it showed in description that 'she' is representative of An India food distributor. I went to check the website. It is some random india website. All these observations again, does not link up. In this case I think my private number and email is already sold FURTHER..
I received a Whatsapp message asking if i am keen to work part-time. Objective is to click on authentic lazada links and add the item to my wishlist. Upon joining, i was invited to join a telegram group: welfare group 68 In this group, they send missions (10 am to 4 pm, break 1 hour, 5 pm to 10 pm) they are about 25 missions in total per day. 22 of which looked like authentic lazarda links to their merchandise. 3 of these missions are known as prepaid task salary.

He gives the instructions to 3/10/2022 monday I went on 2 of these prepaid tasks and they paid me accodringly. Each of these tasks requires you to transfer a certain amount of money first before they can complete the project. On the 3rd task, they asked me to take up a task for $8888 with almost 2 or $3k returns. I rejected. They tried to persuaded me and even offer to lend me money to do it. I rejected. My total lost: $2188

I was contacted on Telegram by a random stranger asking me if I wanted to try a review job. She claimed that the job was easy and I could earn $110 or more daily. The same usual tactics, I then received a Whatsapp msg and she linked me to a website. Was guided to register (use fake name and contact number as no otp needed) it's a very simple website which will generate random hotels for you to rate, just give it a 5 star and you get paid per rating. I did 30 ratings and earned $11 on my account. The minimum withdrawal was $10 so she guided me to withdrawal the $11 to my paynow. She then added me into a telegram group whereby every member were sharing their success stories (earning $200+ coz only have 1 hour today, $500+ coz tired after rating for 2 hours... Etc) and raving to continue topping up their experience gold. She then told me that i have to topup my experience gold in order to continue rating hotels and earning money. It'll be $111. I ask her why and she told me it's to "ensure the authenticity of consumption data and generate effective traffic to increase turnover and visibility of hotels" ... Which I don't understand what she meant. She then said it's to ensure that it's not robots doing the ratings. Anyway, I turned down the offer and she backed off. The website I registered was quickly taken down the next day.
They texted me to say would like me to join a Telegram group . Every day, will be given 25 tasks. Basically most of the tasks are liking particular Instagram accts that they requested.

If you do the prepaid tasks per Instagram account you follow will be paid $5 instead of $2.

Second day hata asked to join for newcomer package with a smaller amount $38 and cashback with 58, i did and got back my money. Going forward amount is flexible.

Got a call from someone claiming to be my friend Alvin Tan, calling from this number (8193 5672) with no + and the person knew my name. He claimed to be my long time friend but i got no recollection. He asked to add his number to phonebook n whatsapp, asked to meet up when free. Next day, he called and said he asked whether i am familiar with dbs account. He said he is facing problem logging in as he lost his phone. I was wary of what he said and told him he should go to the branch to ask instead of asking me and i blocked his number after that as it raises alot of red flags. Then i googled and found similar scam methods reported as well.
Job scam claiming to be from company called "Heroes of digital". Used telegram to ask users to follow Instagram accounts and get paid. Asked to open crypto currency account, and get paid. No money was lost but bank account number info and email address.
I wanted to take a loan of 40k. They claimed to be from "s.e. Investments pte ltd", which is a legitimate company MinLaw registered-list of moneylenders. Before they could “release” the loan to me, they said I needed to pay an active account charge, and another charge, which total to $3500 each (7000sgd both). After paying both charges, they took an hour to forge a document that has MAS logo, saying that the money is held by MAS and I needed to pay another $11,600 for the release of the loan money. That’s when I realised they were never going to offer a loan at a decent interest rate. They also approved of the loan over Whatsapp. Loans will never be approved like that.
Someone called my and identified me by MY NAME. She started off by sharing her name was "Nicole". Then she said that she last her phone last all her contact and this is her new number. She then asks if I remember her, trying to "fish" for information after some chat she drops the call. One day later she called and said that she needed to pay someone and needs to loan $1,000 and promised to return by 4 pm on the same day. I negotiated to 100SGD to loan her. She then said that she will text me how to transfer the money. She then text me a paynow number with a different number then her calling number. she called me again 3-4 times, of course, I did not bother to pick up the call. After 30 mins, I texted her this message "are you in trouble? do you need to call the police? you numbers are different which makes me think that you are in trouble and should get help from the police ! my son is a officer in the police force do you need me to call him for you ?" and she never called again
Caller knew my name and claimed to be a friend. Asked me to save his number so he can contact me via Whatsapp. 2nd time receiving this type of calls, so just put the phone down.
Online friend who asked me to take orders from "Chanel" turned out to be a scammer. Someone called Cathy (方云）, @deshekta suddenly followed me on IG and messaged me. We exchanged some pleasantries and exchanged contact om whatsapp. "she" claimed that she is grew up in Malaysia but have moved over to singapore with her family but their relationship is bad. She has been working in singapore for 10years And that she apparently has a part-time job that she does at night at home which was about tallying accounts, which i didn't think much of. We asked about each other and exchanged greetings and talk to each other, she claimed to stay with her close friend becUse of her poor relationship with her family and was looking for someone to be in a deep relationship with. After a few days, she even took photos of her surroundings to show her whipping up some dishes at home. Being the evergreen single lonely person i fell for the bait. She first asked for 50cents and say some cheeky line like us being a dollar(together in chinese). And when you dont send her, she guilt trip you that you do not like her enough to trust her. She then talk about her sad past heartbreak and say that she was just testing you and to trust her. Shortly after another round of pretending to be interested she agreed to be together with one rule to trust her. then she asked if i am interested in helping her with her part time job as she was sick. I agreed since she voice messaged and asked for help. Turns out, she gave me a number to "Chanel" and told me to message them to say that i'm helping her. The message i got told me to take a screenshot of a chanel product, then to transfer $100 to their account. She then said that once I transfer the money over, they will transfer back $115. She just said to trust her which made me not trust her. She then started insulting me saying this is why I will stay single and not deserved to be loved. My story is exceedingly similar to this other two i saw on the website https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/story-06aug2022235435pm https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-12Aug2022063001AM
The conversations usually started off from a match on a dating app such Tinder, CMB, or others. they would ask you to exchange phone numbers and start conversing over Whatsapp. they usually say they are Malaysian or Chinese national working in Singapore. then they will tell you they work as an accountant, as a consultant or whatsoever. But that is their so called 'first job' to trap you - they will play the pity card to say after that they have a second job. Waiting for you to take the bait and ask them what the job is about. it seems to be some affiliate program that requires you to send messages to other people's social media accounts or phone numbers. if you don't do it, they will just keep harassing you. I didn't follow through as I called their bluff and they realised since then they stopped chatting with me. Sharing this information so others don't fall prey.
Automated voice message from +6583052349 pretending that they are calling from Ministry of Health (MOH), that they have been unsuccessfully trying to contact in regards to vaccination status. Ask to press "1" for English and 2 For Chinese, transferred to someone with a strong Chinese-accent despite me selecting for English. I was confused and revealed no information, in which she hung up on me. Beware of this number +6583052349.
Only 12 Sept. 2022 Contacted via Whatsapp by a person called Sindy to say the job description is just to click on a button to rate APPS. I needed to reach 40 ratings to get commission. But I need to secure my position with a small investment of only $200.00 x 1 40=$Sg280.00. However before I could reach 40 ratings the system reported that i don't have enough credit to continue and I need to top up to continue in order to get my commisions. It went on till the money they ASKED for got too big. I realised too late it was a scam after I have invested over SGd$27000.00 I made a police report on 24th Sept.2022
Another scammer called on 22 sep 2022, a Chinese-Malaysian accent, told me that he has lost his phone and asked me to remember his new phone number. I thought he was a contractor whom I knew. He called me and asked me how to change his mobile update with the bank and kept saying bank needed OTP and he didn't remember. He said he isn't familiar with online banking or how to set his settings, so I used the website info and guided him. Next he told me that his bank account got locked, and he cannot withdraw his money and asked if i could help him make payment to supplier, I replied no! so he hung up. Beware peeps, it seems quite common pattern using this scam.
similar to another case here i am a VICTIM: An agent contacted me through Whatsapp, don't even know my name but say want to offer me a job, they claim to be from GRABJOBS.MY, and that their main purpose is to help apps raise the Review star rating in the app store. Asked me to register on a website www.sailpoint-Agency.com , but all they ask me to do is just click a button 42 times and then apparently that's supposed to send in a review to the app store automatically. Also noticed in the website, it says "usdt" which is a cryptocurrency, and apparently every account has a certain amount of usdt, so with every 'click' you do, the amount is reduced, and once it reached too low, you have to top up with real money in order to keep clicking. They claim you can withdraw this in the end but this is likely the same pattern of telling you to transfer them 50 dollars then they return you 100, then they ask you to repeat the process until the amount you transfer is big enough and you won't get your money back anymore.
1. Call at evening time (21/09) and asked me do i know who is he and i mentioned a name and he claimed he is the one. 2. He told me to delete old phone and replaced this new number 81794073.3. On 22/09 morning, i have received 5 times incoming call from him and he told me that do i know how to unlock one-time otp for UOB account. 4. I told him no and change another topic that his phone has security lock and unable to contact the bank. 5. He told me to loan him balance s$ 4800 but I told him no money and he asked me to borrow from colleague. 6. I told him my colleague won't borrow money &amp; etc...7. Later on, he told me says will contact me later but I blocked his phone number.
I received an email in my personal inbox stating that I have been selected to receive cash compensation from the international monetary fund (IMF). There was a link asking me to check my eligibility to receive cash compensation. Thank God, I have thought carefully that nothing comes so easy in this world and always be cautious and not be lured by such tempting offer. I decided to ignore this email and took screenshot of it before I put it in my mail trash. I want to share this incident to create awareness and alert to public and be more extra careful. Like I mentioned, nothing comes easy in this world.
Contacted me through Whatsapp, don't even know my name but say want to offer me a job, they claim to be from “Singsys, and that their main purpose is to help apps raise the star rating in the app store. Asked me to register on a website www.singsys-mobile.com , but all they ask me to do is just click a button 40 times and then apparently that's supposed to send in a review to the app store automatically.Felt that this was suspicious from there on, because if the process is so automated it shouldn't need a human being to manually click, they could just make a program to automate it.Also noticed in the website, it says "usdt" which is a cryptocurrency, and apparently every account has a certain amount of usdt, so with every 'click' you do, the amount is reduced, and once it reached too low, you have to top up with real money in order to keep clicking. They claim you can withdraw this in the end but this is likely the same pattern of telling you to transfer them 50 dollars then they return you 100, then they ask you to repeat the process until the amount you transfer is big enough and you won't get your money back anymore. The scammer himself says his name is allen, 27 years old, his phone number is 8196 19??.

I wanted to take a loan of 10,000. They posed as s.e. Investments pte ltd (they’re not from there), which is a legitimate company under the mas registered list of moneylenders. Before they could “release” the loan to me, they said i needed to pay an active account charge, and another charge, which totals to 1,500 sgd each (3,000 sgd both). After paying both charges, they took an hour to forge a document that has an mas logo, saying that the money is held by mas and i needed to pay another 3,000 sgd for the release of the loan money.

I received a job offer from "ATEAM STUDIOS" +60176827138 The job is simple - Following and liking Tiktok users to earn $5. I was told to download Tiktok and telegram. My initial thoughts are this has got to be a scam. Cut the story short, I completed the first 4 tasks, first $9 was transferred via paynow after completing 3 task and last task $16 for a newcomer BONUS. Got $25 but I felt very skeptical with all the dodgy processes that they were doing. They are portray as "ateam studios" by sending an ACRA picture with a UEN NO. OF the company. I believe "ATEAM" studios are not part of the SCAM but being used by scammers to create credibility.

How it started: a stranger messaged me on telegram if i was looking for a part time job. Scammers offered me a job that required me to review airlines to make money. They first offered a free trial (to gain my trust i would imagine) and had me rate some airlines. It sounded like an easy job and I got some money from scammers, which was a trick to make the job looked legitimate. I have pasted their explanation below. Minxuan: Hi James! Nice to hear from you. Let me briefly introduce you the job. If you have any questions please feel free to ask right away. :) Aeroclass, is an online airline ticket rating system that does not require you to book a ticket. Its purpose is to help airline ratings contribute to the size of airline turnover and competitive strength in the market our job is mainly to help promote and advertise major airline reviews, we just need to create data on the online airline rating system to help increase the visibility and turnover of airlines.

Please contact me if there are any questions
I didn't get scammed but wanna share my story as it was something similar to what was shared here. A lady texted me via WhatsApp then told me to contact their customer service via telegram. Then, they added me into a telegram group. IT WAS OK AT FIRST BUT THINGS GOT SHADY. SO I LEFT AND REPORTED IT. Here are the MESSAGES: Hi, I am Nicole, the head of recruitment. Our company saw your resume, here is a special job for you, reply me to learn more about the job. Sorry for any interruptions! 😊 This is a social media hype job to increase the popularity of social media celebrities on TikTok.

I first met this guy on CMB before moving on to text on telegram. I believed that he had a script well planned all along as everything was going smooth until he kept requesting for a voice call with me. Started talking about an ex-girlfriend of 4 years who left him because he was too busy with work. He kept sweet talking to me daily for a week then on and kept finding excuses to push back meetups (eg. Have other plans with friends, company is sending him overseas for a project which well last for 2-3weeks). He claimed to be working in a big gaming company in Singapore and seemed very knowledgeable about what the company does. The red flag came about when he called me to help him with talking a few pics of a HDB project he has been investing in. Told him to ask his close friends but he said that he trusted me. I then find it weird and cut him off after. Now that i look back, it seemed that all the images he had exchanged with me were either cropped photos or of low quality. No money was lost but i just want it to serve as a reminder for everyone who is using dating apps and beware of such catfishing and love scams. Stay alert at all times!
Another scammer called in Chinese-Malaysian accent and said he lost his phone and continue asked me remember him, when my boyfriend answered hello hello , the scammer quickly hung up his phone. Not the first time I received similar tactic just different number. Without +65 The mobile is: 81913609
Typical job scam, Claiming that they are from singSys, app developer company, recruit agents to help to improve apps rating…Only need to click 40 times to earn about 60usd -200usd per day…Allowed me to withdraw money to my bank account after 40 clicks which they did..but after that they wanted me to recharge for 500usd. As I sensed something was wrong and straight away rejected them and also blocked them on Whatsapp I just hope everyone can be very careful…
I just received a phone call stating that he is my friend and this is his new number. I keep questioning for his name until he cannot stand it and give me a fake name. After listening to his name, I hung up immediately.
‘Arlene Lee’ approached me on Telegram and claimed to be from Food &amp; Beverage InternationaI Holdings Pte. Ltd. (Registration ID: 200718722C), and tried to promote a PT/FT job per follows: We looking for more people to help us promote international cuisine, and we need to graduaIIy increase the number of people to help the food businesses. 15-60mins ( 13-280+ ) DaiIy Basic rate ( 3700+comm ) -Legit and won't affect you current employment#WFH She asked if I was a Singaporean/foreigner as well as my age. I played along and passed her incorrect information. She later passed on my Telegram contact to an “agent” Stella +65 80465485 under “The Next Big Thing” who would then tell me more details about this “job”. At the point she asked me to register for an account at https://www.bundleapicious.com/web, which is clearly a scam website. I told them off to not try and scam people.
I was matched with a lady by the name of adelaide via tinderi. after a short chat, we decided to take it off platform and chat via WhatsApp. the chat was pleasant for 3 days until she decided to ask for help with her 2nd job on 11 sep 2022 at 9.20pm. She asked if I could help her by taking orders from mytheresa.singapore quoting her name as a recommender so that she could sleep earlier as she had a long day of work. I felt something was not right but procceded to help as she say that she would do the first transaction. After which the price was going higher and higher so i decided to check scam alert and I actually found similar stories. thereafter, I ended the conversation and blocked the person. Would like to warn people not to believe such job offers or helped an online friend to carry out jobs.
I was first contacted on Telegram by a lady who offered me a food review job where i could work anywhere. Followed by a reference to another lady name ‘Niki” through another telegram message, explaining how the job works. The company posted as “the next big thing” marketing company &amp; provided me with a website address. (https://www.affordablecuis.com) the job is to rate food reviews &amp; there is a total of 32 evaluations each set. The 1st set was free &amp; the merchant paid a commission to me of $13. After that, in order to continue to do the job, you have to “renew” and deposit $116. They claimed that you can play a maximum of 4 sets daily; every time you start a new set, you have to deposit $116 into a bank account number that the company will give you through their so-called "customer service" telegram account. Every time the bank account number provided is different. They claimed that you can withdraw and get back all your money, after you complete each set of 32 food evaluations. However, in each set there will be “special delicacies” where the amount started to get bigger &amp; bigger for you to deposit to continue. That's when I realised is a scam and stopped.
Received a call without a phone no (appeared as no caller ID on my phone). I picked up, the caller pretended to be a recruiter from guvill.com and asked if i am employed and looking for a job. I said i am unemployed and yes looking for a job. he got my resume which i dont know how. he asked me where i want to work in SG, US, Ca. I said all is fine as i am feeling suspicious about him, so i dont want to reveal which country i am in. He has a very strong indian accent, and his command of english is not very good. When he asked me what is my current salary, I didnt reveal but asked him what are jobs he has on hand now. he told me he has few jobs and asked me which is i am interested in, i said none. then he moved on to said that applying for a job is not free. this is when i confirmed my doubt earlier on is right, i immediately hang up the phone. I am wonder how he got my resume, and now i am worried if my resume is leaked. will report this to the police too. Job seekers plesae be on high alert. scammers are targetting people who are looking for a jobs. No legit job requires us to make an upfront payment first.
Met a Chinese guy, named peter lee (ig handle: peterlee.sg, now changed to szp_ytek, mobile: 8544 1497) on Instagram and we switched to WhatsApp to chat. We have a mutual follower who happened to be my friend and i got to know from my friend that she has lost money due to the crypto investments introduced by him. He told my friend that he also lost all his money in the investments and have sold his house and car to pay his debts, which of course were fake as he was chatting with me, telling me he stays in condo and sent me photos of a boxing fitness studio and minimart that he has invested in Miami. He also sent me videos of him in his car, eating at restaurants and going shopping which I believed were his tactics to convince me that he is real. In the first week of chatting, mainly in chinese, he started telling me that he is interested in me and we started talking about crypto investments, a topic that he broached. I shared that i am curious and he sent screenshots of pledge mining pool and asked if i wanted him to teach me. When i didn’t give him the time for him to teach me, he turned verbally abusive. I also managed to find out that he is using photos of a malaysian model (jae loo). I sent him a screenshot of the Malaysian model ig and a message to expose him and blocked him after i made a police report. Always be careful not to trust online friends blindly.
I was contacted via LinkedIn private message by a person claiming to be from a recruitment agency. Below is the message: This is Estella from Morgan McKinley! I’m reaching out as I’m working on a Manager, [role] role within the [industry] and thought you might be a good fit! Would you be available for an exploratory chat tomorrow or Thursday? I can also be reached on WhatsApp at +65 932348??! :) Cheers, Estella Estella Alisa Goh Recruiting the best Marketing and Digital professionals across South East Asia
On 13 Sep 2022, roughly around 5:50pm an unknown number called, claiming that he was one of my friends. Wanted me to guess who he was. Apart from that saying he lost his phone and wanted me to save his new contact number.
I'd received a ground phone call with recorded message informing me that i did not reply a number of their calls on requesting to go for booster vaccine shot. After I pressed the number for a particular language, a man answered. But instead of providing relevant info on the booster shots, he kept asking for my personal handphone no., this raised my suspicion, so i questioned him if this is a scam. He hung up immediately. Fortunately, i did not provide him any important info other than my name in English and Mandarin. To think of it, this guy is not pro enough acting like an authoritative figure which exposed him.
i received a call from 8933 0954. He called me and ask me to guess his name.. after informing that i cant recognise him, he keep insisted me to try hard. Until I stated a name, he said it was correct. he said he lost his wallet and phone hence the number is different. He mentioned that he set up a new business and want to invite me to his opening on a certain day. I told him to send me the address and date. He called me again today and inform me that he is still doing setting his bank atm card and ic. He told me that he got stocks coming to sg hence he ask me to do the payment(5k~6k) for him. i told him to come meet me up and collect cash as it is inconvenience for me to do the transfer. He kept asking me to deposit into the bank account. I believe the scammer might see this as well. I wanted to tell him this "nice try"!
To summarise: 1) Avoid any incoming calls starting with +65 2) Even if you have picked up such incoming calls &amp; the caller is introducing himself from any loan company, pls end the call. Be prepared that they will continue to text you. You will need to be firm by ignoring them or blocking many unknown incoming phone numbers. 3) Suspect all these callers have access to the borrower's personal information from the staffs of legal money lenders or financial institutions. They claimed to know where is your residence which is accurate. how can they have access to obtain your residential address???? 4) If you ever noticed, when u are financially stable, u only received calls from financial institutions eg. applying for credit cards, personal loans or balance transfer etc. But once you have reached your financial turbulence, you may start to receive such calls starting with +65. Just sharing some thoughts here for those who have yet to encounter with these people
Got a missed call from the 1st number on 7/9 and i called back as i was expecting parcels and thought it could be the delivery guy. Called back and this guy answered telling me this is his new number and ask me to guess who he was. I was at work so i said i dontknow who is he. He said we even had meal together last month! I said nope I didn’t have any meal with any male friends. Then he laughed and said it was fine and that he would WA me. Nothing came.2nd call received on 9/9 9pm+, out of curiosity i answered. It is the same guy! This time rd he asked “really don’t rmb me?! I am "Jason Ang"!” Then i said I don’t know any “Jason Ang” and I got irritated so i asked him how he got my number. He got angry and shouted back “don't ask me how i got ur number! I even know your home address, your husband, son, mother &amp; father names!” Then he hanged up. I found it funny as i am still single so i decided to call back. He answered and asked “what u want!” So, I asked “so what is my husband name???” He got super angry and shouted “I would call your husband later!” What a joke but people out there pls don’t fall for such stupid scams. Even if they know your name, it could still be a scam.

I received a couple of calls from 81914781, 97114173 claiming to be my 'friend'. The guy had a strong Malaysian accent. Kept asking me to guess his name. I refused to guess and come to this website I realised it was a scam, so I blocked all these numbers. Beware of such fake calls and do note that these scammers were able to address you by your name. Don't be fooled!
They would send you an email about a renewal and said if you wanted to cancel it, please call 8887922761. The person on the other line sounded like an Indian and he claimed that I subscribed to a service which I hadn't used and if I needed to cancel it, I would have to install some sort of programmes on my computer and take certain steps to remove it. I told him that this was a scam and that I would call the call the Police and he hung up. The whole scam was to trick me into installing some sort of spyware or malware so he could take over my computer and steal my info from my computer.
I received WhatsApp message. It claimed to be Erica from morgan mckinley and its number is +601128001376. But it came with the name card that states erica lim as hr consultant and even different number +6581833188. Ercia said, they have few attractive position to offer me, can she share more? Of course, i didn't reply. I googled the company, “Morgan Mckinley" but couldn't find her name. Instead, HR consultant has different name there. I had contacted the company and asked them about Erica lim. They claimed that they do not have such an employee in their company. They are aware of impersonators using their company name through the platforms like Telegram and Instagram to scam people. Beware.
I was notified that there was a Grabpay payment was made without me making any transaction. This is a scam so beware.
Cindy claiming to be from “morgan mckinley” contacted me on WhatsApp saying she have clients in Singapore preparing job opportunities. Asking if she can share more and I agreed. Next she shared that the requirements for the job is Singaporean/pr/visa holder, adult, salary payment via online banking. Shortly after she mentioned please look out in WhatsApp for more details. Next another local mobile number contacted me and begin the conversation with need more job information, what is your name? He then shared he is brian and shortly his WhatsApp name appear as “Brian” when before he reply his name it was ~shshsh. He shared the job was to assist app developers to raise rating in app store and be top 100 apps so that more users will view and download them. I will have to rate 30-120 apps daily and it should take only 30 minutes to 120 minutes of my time daily. The salary is $2500/month with 1% paid commission daily. When I clarified that I will receive the commission daily, he replied with the same text above. I asked if there is any contract required and he replied no. I found the whole conversation fishy and told him that I’m not keen and blocked his number.
One fine day i received a random text from a stranger that who claim that she is from IMPOSSIBLE MARKETING goes like this "congratuation, you are invited to join our program to earn $110 to $500 at your free time" and i inquired more about the job and it is bascially just to follow and like a INSTRAGRAM USER THEY POSTED IN THEIR TELEGRAM WORK GROUP that consist of 100 workers AND screenshot the proof to them than they will paynow you $6 for ever 3 sucessful follows. with only 25 task per day and to enourage all member who continuous completed 12 tasks a day will get an extra bonus of $18.88 and complete all 25 task will get an extra $58.88. how simple it is, i went ahead to apply their workgroup and did a few task they posted and true enough i get paid $6 for every 3 instragramers who I sucessfully followed. However in between the 25 tasks there were 3 prepaid task group project where they were recuiting different ips to assist hyping their clients' cryptocurrencies and they required the users to pre-pay them first and their money will be returned back to them after 10 mins with commission. The red flag here is that the comission is a lot; Second red flag is users will than start posting their screeshot that they have transfer their money and some posted that they have received their money with commission, Third red flag was that after earning like $120+ on my third day, another one user from the same workgroup messaged me and asked me about this prepaid task, then i replied him telling him that it was safer not to engage in the prepaid task and just do the normal instragram follower tasks. A few mins later i was dismissed by the workgroup and the admin told me that my job is done. So now, i know their scam tactics is that they first paid me for the simple instragram job to convience me that they are legit and those users who post the screenshot for the prepaid task are their own people try to lure me into their scam than they will act like a normal user to dig info from you to check if you know it's a scam. Any job that requires you to pay first is a scam!
Caller dialled from a sg mobile number - 93417138, and knew my name.Spoke in Mandarin with a heavy Malaysian accent. Claimed to be a friend who had lost his phone and he was calling from a new number. I hesitated, and when I asked who he was, he kept saying it was a bad thing that I couldn't recall who he is from just his voice - "jia lat lor, you can’t remember me".Wife also received a similar call yesterday via 81791595 using the same modus operandi.
The message with a link asked you to pay tax for a DHL order. Once you click on the link, it led you to a very original looking DHL page. There, you are asked to give all your credit card details. But the tracking number does not exist and all the other links on that page do not connect to DHL
Called and insisted that he was my long lost friend, Kept trying to prolong the phone call and kept asking me to guess who he is. He was able to say my name but hung up when my bf said he might be a scammer. Googled and found out that he has used this number for scams just a few days ago
I came across this FB profile named Ginny Qi, she claimed to be the top ten crypto trader, and also shows herself as a very helpful person. I added her as my friend in Fb, she told me that I could invest with just 500USD. And she guaranteed that in one week she would gain big profits. So, I agreed and brought bitcoin and transferred to the Kucoin address that she send me. After one week she showed me the profit as 116850 in total and I could withdraw all in 10 minutes and just give her 10% of the profit amount. So, I applied for the withdrawal in the trading account. Than came an email that i need to pay about 15k USD as broker commission. So, we had an argue on this. Than she told me she could help me with 12k and i pay 3k and in 10mins i will receive all the profit. After 2 to 3 days still i never receive the money. After that another email came, now they are asking another 2500usd, saying that the money has been transferred and now need to pay another 2500 call as reflection fees. I got very angry on this. I told ginny that this is never ending, no prior notice was given about all this payment. I told her i want my 3k back. Every time they say this will be the last payment, until now I never get back my $3k capital. I knew that I would never able to recover my money but I hope that my story could help others.
I received an unknown phone call and was shocked that the caller called me by my name. He said he had changed his contact number and asked me to take note. I asked him who is he? he said wah you don't know me? You got so many friends that you don't remember me? I said I am busy and working. he said he will whatsapp me. He hung up the call. Then I know that it was a scam call. The number does not have a +65.
Caller claimed to be a friend who has just changed his phone number. Asked me to guess who he was. When I told him that I gave up guessing, he claimed to be "Kelvin" and said he had lost his wallet and phone. FIRST RED FLAG. - he invited me for a catch-up and claimed he had just opened a new cafe with his friend nearby my house. I asked where the cafe was, he said he didn't have the details yet. 2nd red flag - I asked him to send me the details, but he did not. 3rd red flag - he called me again, I did not pick up and asked him to text me instead as I was busy. he messaged me back and asked me to call him back. I knew it was a scam because I only got one "Kelvin" in my life.
Given a call to buy office furniture for 'Stand Hotel'. Caller claimed that it was an urgent, I sent them the quotation and he straight away confirmed the deal. Thereafter, he asked for my bank account for him to pay. Then, he asked me to purchase VIP electric beds which I didn't have. He gave me a contact for me to purchase the beds from. Thinking that the whole procurement purchase was really strange, I rejected the deal and called the hotel for verification. While the hotel hadn't got back to me, i realised that this whole deal was most likely a scam as the purchaser would always negotiate and go to the respective buyers for the best deal. The most ridiculous claim that the caller made was the at hotel's account could only remit money once a day. Please check who you dealing with and ensure that the person is genuine before continuing with the deal.
It all happened on 14-15 apr 2022. The scammer I met - eric (89279502) on fb. After the whole incident i discovered he misused another fb user photos impersonating as him to commit scams. The business acct number on whatsapp he lured me into was “mytheresa online cs” (88078289) and the website link given to identify the products for payment was legit (mytheresa website). But were asked to transfer directly to payee (“merchant”) via internet transfer or Paynow (88240548). Basically it’s the same about paying first, commission &amp; principal sum will be refunded after each transaction. There will be excuses such as account freezing, recharging account to request for more money, very fast it increased fr 3 digits to 5 digits. I regretted for not stopping immediately when i realize things were amiss, i was still hoping there is still some hope in getting back all my money. For first transaction, eric “bank in” money and told me to send the receipt to customer service for verification. After that, cs will request me for bank details to refund. Eric told me his account is already tied to his membership acct and for me to help him obtain back the refund. I didn’t think much at first, proceeded and it is obviously a scam or lie. After mentioning you have no more money left, he will tell you that he can help you top-up a portion first ($14k), the rest you need to think of solution, eg loaning from friends family. They are very well versed with bank operations, eg UOB daily Paynow transfer only restrict to 5k, you need to transfer all your money out to other banks or POSB to make transfers. For big amount they may even ask you to spilt into 2 transactions, eg: 10k +7k. Then when daily transfer limit is low, they will tell you go to manage setting raised your daily limit to 100k. They will mention that adding payee requires 12 hr to take effect so best is to transfer payment out using POSB account. Frankly, I myself don’t even know all these. They are very experienced scammers. Moral of story is, do not be greedy. There is no such thing as easy money. I lost nearly 62k in 3 hrs! Even the police was shocked. Luckily the last transaction was blocked by POSB and didn’t get thru to the scammers successfully. Scammer panic and asked me to quickly transfer the amount out to other banks before it got frozen. Scammer still asked me to lie to banks that the money was transferred to help friends on some purchases if they call me. They will tell you they aren't scamming you if not why bother helping you to fork out money first. They will keep pressing you rushing you to quickly transfer money over and send over the receipt. In doubt, pls approach friends/family first or check with relevant authority for second opinion, do not rush into things.
Mandy lee whatsapp me, claimed that she is a recruiter from Malaysia Adecco, asking me if I was looking for a job. When i said "yes", she said she woiuld refer the person in charge to me. Later, Lacy WA-ed me about a job. This job was to help developer's apps raise star ratings, increase star and good rating of the app on the app store and play store, only need to work 20-90mins per day and salary is $600/week. When i told her i am not interested, she asked me why and i told her this is a scam. she asked me why i think so. 1st red flag - they didnt know my name. 2nd red flag - she said there is no need to sign any contract Lacy no. is +65 9164 5678. Many scammers are preying on people who are looking for a job.
Received a call from a number 81787051 (+65 prefix was not present). caller was speaking in Mandarin with a malaysian accent. He asked if my name was correct which I did not acknowledge. I requested for his name but he went on to say "it's me lah...you don't remember?" this same conversation went on for some time until he finally said he was someone i knew from my workplace. he explained the reason that he called was to update me his new phone number. throughout the whole time, he refused to reveal his name and kept prompting me to make a guess. I refused to make any wild guesses and informed him that he probably got the wrong number. he remained insistent that we knew each other and kept persuading me to think harder. I asked for more details about where and when we met but he was unable to provide a satisfactory answer. Eventually, he gave a random name and tried to make it seem like i have conveniently forgotten about him. He dropped the call, and I stressed that I didn't know him and asked for his surname.
Received a call from a local number (93477748) that did not have the +65 prefix. picked up as i thought i could be delivery person. A Chinese male started telling me in Chinese he changed his phone number and that he will Whatsapp me this as his new number. When I asked who he is, he just kept saying "It's me lah!" and did not give a name. When I told him I don't know anyone called that, he hung up.
Received a WhatsApp message from a recruitment agency from Malaysia (fiona) saying they got my application for job hunting and asked immediately if I have bank account in Singapore. Asked me to wait for the person in charge to explain the job description. Minutes after, received a WA message from a guy named Anson Wu then explained that they are a company who help the apps to appear in the top 1-100 hot searches in the play/app store so that they can be seen and viewed by more users to download. Salary will be $500 per week and you only need to work 45-60mins a day. Sent me a link saying it was a company system for me to start working remotely. It was a scam clearly coz there’s no such thing as working immediately without even undergoing for a phone/voice interview nor a background check especially the important details that an employer must acquire to hire applicants.
REceived a call from 9347 7748 (no +65 prefix) so i picked up the call (initial thought was delivery staff). A m'sian guy started asking me to guess who is he, which i thought was kind of weird. so i questioned him back, "like who is this?" He continued to say things like "you don't know who am i?", "you have a lot of m'sian friends working in sg that you don't remember who am i"? i was like, "no, i don't think i know you" he started to ask me if "xxxx" is my mobile last 4 digits, which i did not acknowledge as i don't see how is it related. I got pissed with this "guessing game", so i raise my voice and told him off and said "just tell me who you are, don't waste my time" i think he might have been shock, and he hung up the call himself.
I received a call from this number 9347 7748. He called and said that he is so and so, remember me? He continued to say he changed his number so he thought he'd call to tell me. I don't recognize his voice. He speaks in Mandarin in a strong Malaysian accent. As I was busy working and got no time to talk to him, I ask him to drop me a text to tell me he changed his number and hang up. No text from him after hanging up. I think it is an impersonation scam. This guy pretended to be my friend.Be careful
Chatted with the person for quite some time and got introduced to how she was making quick money by fulfilling orders on the site luisaviaroma. Basically the scam goes like this 1. They provide you with a link to the product and asks you to transfer the amount to a given bank account (money mule). The given bank account names are both malay name based on what I've experienced so far. 2. They start of with products that costs &lt; $100 to bait you into thinking its a good deal 3. You make the payment and get the initial sum refunded plus a 5% commission. 4. Slowly the items get more and more expensive and the conditions suddenly changes from 1 quantity to 3 quantity and they request that you make that payment twice. I did not notice the change and only make the transfer for 1 item. They then contacted me that I'll have to make the payment for the other 2 items (Which i did, thinking that I'll get back my money). Then later they told me that I'll have to repeat the process again as it was a double order. It was then did i realised that I've been in a scam all along. When confronted, scammer would make all sorts of excuses to get you to pay that balance amount. Even to the extend of offering to pay up to 10k of the balance amount). My story is very similar to https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-21Aug2022081909AMz and I would like to SHARE THIS: IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, ITS MOST LIKELY A SCAM, DON'T BE BLINDED BY GREED.. THIS WAS INDEED A PAINFUL LESSON TO LEARN.
I received a Whatsapp message from “chris whom claims he was from 3sc group recruitment. He asked if I was interested in some job offers. I could listen first and decide for myself after. 1 day later a guy name "chris" WA-ed me introducing me to a job from a company called "3 sided cube". Below is what he said: 3-sided cube is an e-commerce platform, there are many application developers promotional applications. This job is mainly to help application developers to help push up their app ratings so that their apps can appear in the top searches. This help the app developer get better score on app stores and get more sales. The most obvious red flags that it was a scam was when: 1) he provided me a link and told me I could start by using his account first which is totally idiotic. No jobs would do that 2) he sent me a screenshot of his bank acc showing his weekly salary. 3) he texted me almost every day thereafter, trying to convince me to join

I made a transfer of $200 for an Apple airpods pro that I wanted to purchase from this scammer from carousel and did not receive the item. I was texting the seller through whatsapp and asked about the item and the authenticity and the delivery options. After I transferred $200 through bank transfer to him, I asked him about the estimated delivery. He ("muhammad nasr?? bin mo?? Ta??) replied back by saying it will take 3hrs to reach my house. I transferred him around 3 pm and from then till 11 pm i still did not receive the item. I kept on texting him and spamming him and yet he did not reply. I asked him to transfer my $200 back for a refund and said or else i would make a police report and yet he still did not reply. In the end, this guy scammed me for $200.
Got a WhatsApp message asking me if I was interested in looking for a job. When i told them I’ve already found a job, they ask if i want to do it part time and earn some easy cash. Then they started asking you to download discord &amp; tiktok to help their merchant push follow &amp; like. It seemed to be real and I did it for awhile. Then they started posting a new pre-paid task where someone will guide you what to do. They say that we get pick how much to transfer them as the merchant will hype up the cryptocurrency market say their merchant already make payment to them and it's guarantee to get your money back. In short, you transfer like 50+ and earn 70+ once its completed. The more you transfer, the higher the return. When i follow they advise to transfer through PayNow/banking, I received a message from dbs that transfer was rejected. Then they tried providing another paynow account and i still couldn't transfer. The staff then gave me some reason why I couldn't transfer and ask me download another apps but i find it suspicious even if the apps appear in goggle Playstore. I didn't download though and the next moment, before I knew it, my bank account got frozen and I needed to head down to the branches to unlock my account.
Received a WhatsApp message on from this person 'Eunice' which claimed to be from bgc group recruitmentEunice asked if I was interested on a job offer and if i accept, someone will contact me. I have asked her if she can share more details on the job description, she replied saying she don't have the details and said someone will message me on the details. So i went with the flow. 1 day later, a person named 'Andrew' dropped a Whatsapp message and shared the job description. Andrew introduced me to his company called " Fenzo digital ", which works with app developers all over the world, mainly helping them to optimize the ratings and star ratings of their apps so that their apps will be downloaded by more people. This is obviously a job scam because shouldn't recruiters already have and be able to provide client's job role description to those whom they contacted?
I collected my new passport two days back on 24 Aug 2022. The next day, I received a recorded voice informing me that they were from "ICA" and that there was a serious issue with my passport and that I should contact the “ICA” office immediately. When I called back this number, +6587181131, a man answered but the voice call was disconnected at once. I reported this in the feedback form to ICA. They replied saying it was a scam call and that they would never call from a +65 number and not to disclose any information. There was nothing wrong with my new passport. So, be careful. Don’t disclose any information to anyone about your passport or any other personal details such as bank accounts etc. be on the safe side.

i received a call from 80534118. This guy said he had just changed phone number and requested me to guess who he was. I said I do not know who he is.

I shall text you later."
Met the girl from Twitter, then chatted on Telegram. She asked me to go to Vista Point to wait for her and informed me that her manager would contact me to verify if I was from the Police. Then, the manager called me from this number +601160527689; asked me to buy iTunes card and send him the PIN. He said that the call couldn't accept cash. After giving him $1.15k he continued telling me that he needed an $1.2k for the girl identity "protection fee". This was when I realised that I got scammed and stopped giving him the money. He started threatening me. I am very scared as I've provided him the picture of my i/c.

I told Mr Lin, he ignored it. i told him the whole thing was unheard of, i didn't know anything about bitcoin and i didn't know how to do it. he sent me instructions about creating an account in 'paxful.com' and told me he will guide me creating the account. i told him i didnt like all these, i was not doing it, he kept saying it was ok if you want to learn, i told him his money would never reach me because of 1. i didnt pay bitcoin, 2. my name in the transfer instruction was wrong, if his money was locked somewhere in the cyber space, i was sure he could sort it out with JP Morgan. i blocked his no. and when I got to Carousell, it had a message said the user was banned. I blocked him and disregard, he Whatsapped me about 5mins later with a different number, country code +915 905 6484 (from Nigeria??) i called my local bank account manager immediately told him what I stupid thing i did, he assured me that as long as i didnt release my banking passwords, my risk was rather low. but anyway, I transferred the money out from that account just to be safe, some unpleasant experience from a Carousell beginner.

Beware of unsolicited phone calls claiming to be from 'friends'. Similar incident happened to me - This person with a strong Malaysian Chinese accent called me, number no +65 prefix and he knows my first name. He also followed the same script and said in mandarin that his number was just changed to this new one. I asked him who he was but he refused to give name and asked me to guess. When i asked him to tell me, he then said he would message me. That's when I decided to search the scam alert website and found this scam reported just 2 days ago and decided to share his number since it's a different one from the last that was reported.
Connected with this lady on Tinder. Immediately, she asked to connect on WhatsApp. based of her profile, she was a beautician from Malaysia. We chatted for awhile, and she mentioned that she was required to fulfil mytheresa order per night. Out of curiosity, I have decided to help her. initially, she and her team will start to bait you with the small amount for the first order. after, you have completed the first order, you will gain small amount of monetary from it. so this is start of the trap!!! Subsequently, the order would require higher amount until you paynow is hit to the limit and no longer able to complete the order. This is a painful mistake for me. hopefully someone is able to read this and do not make the same mistake as me.
This person called me, number no +65 prefix and he knows my name, said his number changed to this new one and asked me to change number but refuse to give name and kept making me guess his name, I got irritated and told him to tell me otherwise i will hang up. he tried to turn the situation around by stating something he claimed about me which turned out to be not true and I hung up. googled and found many scams in the same vein being perpetuated and decided to share his number.
Scammer contacted me on Carousell and asked me to email them. I encountered the same incident as this person: """ My experience happened on 13 july and it is similar to the story related on 11 july on this scam alert website. it was the same scammer named anthony p. he wanted the item sent to a person named vivian pedrosa in malaysia. After several e mail exchanges between me and him, he sent me an e mail informing me of the transfer confirmation sent from citibank intl team. the e mail address was transferoffice@usa.com. I did not continue with the transaction as i found it strange that i had to sent a shipment tracking number/recept before i could receive payment. i decided to e mail him to tell him that I would not be sending the item without full payment first. when i suggested that he found another mode of payment, he replied that the bank transfer was the only mode of payment he had. i then politely told him that i was not comfortable with the transaction. His response was also "K"! """ Initially, the person said he paid me via paypal but there was no paypal transaction. After which, i was told that he has bank transferred me but it turns out to be an email scam experienced as the same person before. Beware of him

I saw ads on Facebook on money loan with low interest rate, I clicked on the link to indicate my interests to take up a loan. On 28 Jul, a man named Jack called me and asked me what's the loan for, and told me he was from "credit 89" and he told me my approved amount is $30k, but he need to do a test payment. He transferred $1k to my bank and required me to return $250 x 5 plus an additional $1.3k to clear. I paid the $250 x 5, and eventually paid $1.3k on 17th aug. Upon transferred the $1.3k, he told me this amount did not go to him as the underground finance cannot pay him because i did not write his code JACK8888 on the comment. He told me to transfer again before he can disburse the $30k to me. I was worried i cannot get my loan thus I transferred $1.3k again. He then turned aggressive and scolded me why I put at ref and did not save the recipient name as JACK8888, I stopped transferring any more money and blocked his contact. Police has been made by both me and my company. Investigations are going on..
Met this girl on TWITTER. so added her on Whatsapp, agreed to meet at jurong west street 64. As she'll not accept cash because afraid of "police fishing". asked to buy itunes card 150$ initially, then ask for another 2000 for "DEPOSIT RISK" AND then ASK another 4000 for "INSURANCE", I refused to pay and they started to called/message/send threatening messages/videos using different numbers (+60174416246/+60109334642). The 'boss' said that he needed a guarantor, if not they needed another $2k iTunes card, which I ended buying. They asked for another $1k. I, then, realised is a scam, the guy told me to pay him if not he would come my house and threat ME and I thought after giving some amount of money, he would be gone but he kept on coming so I told myself: "i am very stupid to be scammed by people online" and I would like to advise everyone to be careful of these scams. Obviously, these are scammers posing themselves as "gang members" so that people will be frightened and give in. Beware of adding people in TWITTER/WHATSAPP with +60 phone number with Line ID ALL PLATFORM. I am a victim and I would not want anyone to be part of it as well. Report to the police if he/she continues to harass you!

A man with a Malaysian accent called me and started talking about how he moved here and is based here now. When he stopped talking, he asked me if I remembered who he was. I said xxx as i have a Malaysian man friend and he said lucky I remembered him. We had a nice convo where he told me he invested in a cafe here, wanted to invite me for the opening and will text me the address to let him know when i do down to the cafe. He also said this is his new number as he lost his wallet and phone the day before and was in the midst of getting all his cards. He asked me to delete his old number. The next day, he called me again and said that he needed me help to transfer $3.8k for the inventory of the cafe as the bank side had issue and he couldn't take the money out. I said i need to ask my husband. I texted my friend's Malaysian number and he told me it was not him.
I receive a phone call on 13-Aug, Saturday. The person claimed to be my fren, and where I first hear the voice, it really sounded like my fren even the way he speak, plus i just met him on friday and he mention he was going to travel to Malaysia. The caller claim that he was tom and lost his phone, he requested me to change my fren no to his. Because it was a voice call everything sounded very real. On 15 Aug, Monday, my (Fake) fren claim that he need to urgently transfer money to some contractor for some work and ask if i could transfer the 5k to him first. I was reluntant at first, because this (real) fren of mine have nvr ask money from me before. But he explain that he got no time to go to the bank to change his dbs bank app phone no to new number. reluctantly I borrow him 3k, and later in the day he ask for 500 and another 1.3k, which he claim would transfer back to me at 4pm. I lost a total of 4.8k in a short time. on 15 aug, 11pm, when i find this rather weird, I msg my fren on his old number, and was pretty lucky that he replied me immediately, then I call him to ask if he lost his phone and did he call me on Saturday and Monday morning. He said he was so busy how could he have called me. that's when everything unravel to me that I was scam. I have little hope of getting the money back, but I just want to share this so more are aware of it. A voice call that sound too real and so real is fake. I couldn't believe it. I know of job scam via SMS and Telegram, and many other scam, but this is the first time I receive a phone call voice scam. Be aware everyone, don't be too trusting.

I got to know the lady on Facebook dating. Went on to chat on WhatsApp. The scammer sent photos of herself, we chatted and spoke till quite late one night. Came one night, she asked me to help her to contact another WhatsApp business account (Dior online customer support) to help her with some orders. I proceeded to help as I didn't think of it as much. However, even though at the start, they gave me some commissions to catch me off guard as they started to increase the amount of money needed till the point i wasn't able to pay. The final straw was when I made the full amount, they say my account got frozen and need to unfreeze by doing another order task which is $8500. at this point of time, i realize that i was caught in a scam. I quickly make a police report when i confirm with my other friends. I suspect this is an organised group doing these catfishing to cheat money from people. i suspect it could either local or Malaysians or even mainland Chinese as their transaction is all on paynow and the names of the account are mostly Malay and chinese.
A Malaysian-accented Chinese man claimed to lost his phone and wanted to inform all his friends about his new phone. He kept claiming he was my colleague and asked me to guess. As I worked with many contractors I was embarrassed when I couldn't recognise his voice at all. He asked for a few names to guess and I gave it. He claimed he was 1 of them. That is when I know something is not right. I googled the number and saw similar cases here. I proceed to share my encounter here to help warn others.
The job offer sounded too good to be true. You will receive payment for the first few times but I skipped the payment tasks. They stated that cashback within 10 mins' time. The whole deal sounded too sceptical. For example, they will ask for payment for 26503 , and offer a cashback of $32503.
Encountered a “Fake Friend” scam. A caller using an sg number with a very strong Malaysian Chinese accent called. Informed me that changed his number, but kept asking if I knew who he was while hinting that he is the fat fat wear specs friend. He did irritate the hell out of me. So when I checked this website, there is another entry on this same number. So yup this is definitely a scam.
Met a girl called chan Chui Shuen in a social media app, we had a good time of chatting and she brought me into an online gambling website called 星河国际 which I managed to earn some minor profits at first. However, after that I’m being pulled into bigger bets of gambling by her due to the bonus offered by the gambling website (using Chinese valentine's day as the promo excuse) and slowly fall into the trap as I couldn’t cash out my money in the online gambling website and they keep asking and threatening me to put more money (using rules violation and cash deposit as an excuse) in order to cash out from the online gambling website. they mention that all the cash deposit can be withdrawn with my money altogether in the gambling website but they never did so. I fell for the trap for the first and second time as I was manipulated by them of my fear (Fear of couldn't take out the money from the gambling website) and greed (for the Chinese Valentine's day bonus at the first time), and slowly I woke up when I realise that they will never return my money and I blocked all of them from being further manipulated by them. Lesson learnt. do not ever trust easily an online individual who has never been verified before, no matter how sweet talking they are or how true they look like. we cannot outsmart the scammers as they have a lot of scam ideas to come up with. the best way to deal with them is never get in touched with them at all, block any unsolicited calls, emails and messages and be careful of every online people you are getting into with.

I was matched with a lady by the name of Sherene via Heymandi. after a short chat, we decided to take it off platform and chat via WhatsApp. the chat was pleasant for 3 days until she decided to ask for help with her 2nd job on 13 aug 2022 at 9.20pm. she asked if I could help her by taking orders from mytheresa.singapore quoting her name as a recommender so that she could sleep earlier as she had a long day of work.

The lady by the name Kristie introduced herself as head of recruitment from 'FZ Media Pte Ltd'. She mentioned about tiktok is one of the best platforms out there and I would get paid just by liking and following influencers.

I received a call from non +65 Singapore number. The caller had a Malaysian accent and spoke quite quickly and casually. So i didn't manage to catch if he said my name in the first place. So I asked him for his name then he just said "you don't know meh. we had meals before together". I didn't share my name or any details to him. So when I asked him 2nd time and he didn't reply what's his name. I told him I was busy and got to go. After a while, i decided to block his number from my phone. i am reporting here everyone know that scammers are starting to use numbers without +65 to call out. Please be careful and always take time to verify first.
Someone called zhenxinli, @aini0523 suddenly followed me on IG and messaged me. We exchanged some pleasantries and i asked whether i know her from somewhere, but somehow "she" claimed that she is from Malacca and working at a yoga studio in Suntec city. And that she apparently has a part-time job that she does at night at home which was about tallying accounts, which i didn't think much of. After a while she asked if it's ok to move the conversation to WhatsApp and i agreed. We asked about each other and exchanged greetings, she claimed to stay with her older brother and her sister in law. After a few days, she even took photos of her surroundings to show her whipping up some dishes at home and watching ndp. She then asked if i am interested in helping her with her part time job. I agreed wondering what's so difficult about the part time job. Turns out, she gave me a number to "Chanel" and told me to message them to say that i'm helping her. The message i got told me to take a screenshot of a chanel product, then to transfer $100 to their account. I asked her how come they are asking me to transfer money to their account. She then said that once I transfer the money over, they will transfer back $115. I asked her how come she is the one telling me and not the Chanel person. She just said to trust her which made me not trust her. I challenged her to transfer me $100 and i will use that $100 to transfer to that account and if i get $115 back I will give her back the $100. She then started insulting me saying this is why I will stay poor and i told her i'd rather work part time jobs that exchange time for money than participate in her money laundering scam. My story is exceedingly similar to this other one i found on the website https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/story-06aug2022235435pm
She added me on Facebook with an account named Alyssa Lim and said she wanted to know more friends. The scammer was pretty patient she talked to me for like a good 4 days before she finally asked me to help with her part-time job so she can sleep early. Then I knew this was IT!! She then sent me the 'Hermes' online shit and I finally told her she need to up her game it was too easy and then blocked her.
I received a text from a stranger to ask if I was looking for a job. The job offered to pay me a salary ranging from $2 to 5 by following social media account. I got paid by liking the account and subsequently, I was asked to contact @angie_5778 from Telegram. I was invited to a group chat which paid for tasks coming in every 30 mins. Then it came to a prepaid task whereby a cash bonus would be paid once the money was deposited. Under the influence of the members inside, I bided for the task 3.5k to get 4.5k cash by depositing money for the merchant. I was required to contact ann the receptionist to advance to a merchant account. I was asked to contact @andy1882 for more advanced task. The advanced task is a group task comprising of 6 members to deposit $18888 to get the bonus of $26k. It was too good a deal to be true and I really cannot afford because the money was big. The members tried to convince me that it was a good business opportunity and they were rushing me to continue with the deposit. Under their pressure to put the deposit, I borrowed 5k from my husband and i stopped the transfer after contacting my friend to borrow the remaining amount and knowing that it was a scam. What the scammers were really good at are they were manipulative and in my opinion I gave in more because I wanted to take back my initial deposit. It was the most regretful decision and it has cost so much for me.
Phone no +6582116242 Phone NO2 +6586277188 Happened during surfing tantan. A girl approached me and had a chat with her. Told that her job was office admin and having part time job of taking order for customer by Chanel brand. After few days, she / he mentioned that need some help with her orders because she didn't have a good sleep. After that she forwarded me a phone with "Chanel" business acc and said I could proceed so to help her with ordering stuff. Things starting to be fishy here so I have a check on this website and saw a familiar story with Dior brand, so I probably send her him the link And voila, instant block by her him. Careful my friend, if women was attracted to you, its probably FAKE.
This male caller called me and said my name correctly. He spoke in a local singaporean chinese accent. He asked me if I could remember him? I said “no”. He said why can't recognise his voice, just because he changed his number. He asked me to think again and described himself as wearing specs and plumb (looks like a description of myself actually! Maybe he even got a photo of me somehow). I said no again and asked him to cut the bs and tell me who he was. Then he said he had an incoming call and will call me again and hung up. After several minutes, I called that number again several times, but no one picked up. Sharing my encounter here o prevent others from getting scammed. Nothing was lost other than confirmation to him of my name. I am just surprised that the scammer can use a phone number that looks legitimate to call. There is no "+65" in front.
On 9 Aug, I received a call from a no. which is not in my address book. This caller had a Malaysian accent asked me how was I. I asked him for his name since the no. is not registered and he said, "aiyo, you cannot recognize my voice meh, you make a guess". so I asked if he is XXX and he said yes. he then went on to tell me that this is his new hp no. and asked that I erased the old no. and replaced with the new number. he told me he lost his HP and wallet so he's calling to inform of the change in no. he proceeded to ask if AM free this Sat as he started a cafe with his friend at Northpoint and wants to invite us to the opening. I ended the call by telling him to send me details and time of his new cafe opening. No message from him after. The next morning, I received a call from xxx again, saying that he needed my help. he was at ICA to collect his IC and he cancelled all his cards since he lost his wallet. he has 1 lot of supplies coming in today and he needed to borrow $2,900 from me to pay first and will return me by 3pm after his cards are being re-issued. I told him I will discuss and let him know and so the call was ended. Since XXX is a common friend of my husband and I, my husband messaged XXX to ask if he had contacted me and it turned out that he did not. Lesson learnt and some pointers to share, 1. if anyone called and asked you to guess, don't do it. By doing so, we gave him an identity to assume. 2. whenever in doubt, call up the person to verify and don't simply erase the old no. 3. do not simply agree to transfer/lend an unknown caller money. on a side note, it is indeed scary that this scammer sounded convincing.
Connected with this lady on Tinder. Immediately, she asked to connect on WhatsApp, which i already smelt a rat because we didn't really chat a lot at that point in time. According to her profile, she was an accountant from Malaysia. I asked her what was she doing this late and she replied, in Mandarin, sayng that she was working on mytheresa orders. Later, at 3 am, she replied to say that this was her part time work, and she was helping the merchant to create a real order transaction I’ve read the stories here and I knew this was going to be a job scam. I immediately deleted her and shared her contact here.
I happened to meet her in Telegram for a massage service. She said she was coming home at the end. She stated she forgot the oil and asked me to transfer the money for the service . I had transferred the 50 dollars and she din respond after that.
possible money mule activity alert!!! I met Li Tin on TikTok and move the chat to WhatsApp. after which, she convinces herself on many accounts that she is real and is doing many jobs to pay off debts. work till her eyes pain went to see a doctor. just tonight she came up to ask me to help out with her "Mission" or "task" where she works with "Hermes" marketer to "push the product sales up" details of the job are as follows: 1) click on the link which they provided to sg Hermes site, where it shows the product 2) take a screenshot of the product and send it to the Hermes marketer admin. (spoof number: +65 80479368) 3) they will then provide detail of an account for you to transfer the price of the product to. after which, they will refund you. with you providing your name(gave my alias) , bank account number, and the liaison (i.e. li tin) smell something fishy about this but went ahead to push for the 1st transaction with li tin providing the funds for the 1st transaction and indeed the funds were transferred to my account ($131) but it was from a random guy, MOHAMAD IDROS BIN YUSOF. which I presume is another victim. Block and reported both li tin and the "Hermes" marketing admin. made a report to my bank, reset the banking services, and close my account. No monetary losses. A note to everyone, always verify the potential recruiter first so that you don't fall into scammers' trap!
I received a call tell me that they have contacted me for several times and ask me to presse “1” (English) or “2” (Mandarin) for more details. A lady claiming she is Ms Au told me she is from "MOH" and advised me that they will have to cancel my medical balance (?) As i illegally sent a unregistered medicine from Guangdong, China to a gentleman or lady in Singapore. As I didn’t do so and told her that it must be a id theft. In order to solve this issue, they will help transfer to the police office in Guangdong. Anyways, I found it to be weird and told her that I have something urgent to deal with and hung up the phone (although they keep calling me).
Someone impersonating a beautiful lady added me on Facebook, "she" claimed that she just want to chat and meet friends, I was a little bit suspicious but I am curious to see how it goes, so she continued to chat with me and sent me some photos of herself and what she cooked to try and convince me that she's a real person and to make some connection with me, she said that she has a full-time job as an audit and have a part-time job after work helping Chanel with their purchase data, she will always say that she work this part time job until very late and it is very tiring for her and her eyes hurt because of it. Fast forward about 2-3 days she asked me for help on her part-time job for Chanel as she doesn't want to sleep too late and hurt her eyes, so I decided to help her. She guided me to a number indicating that it is Chanel's customer service line, I followed her guidance until it reached a point where i have to paynow $100 to this a number to complete the job, she said that once i paynow $100 to that account a few minutes later i will get back $110, never in my life was i so confirm that it was a scam lmao, so i told her that i do not trust this and I asked her to transfer me first and i will transfer it back once they have returned it, she kept trying to convince me that it was real and told me to trust her and never transferred me the money and still tried to gaslight me into doing so lol, so i called her out and asked her to take a selfie with a specific pose so that I would trust her, and she couldn't do it, and i started to call her out for being a scammer which she then reciprocate with hostile remarks. I told her that i hope she get caught soon and she responded with "I will happily be living in Singapore".Trust me when I said she sounded convincing, she was.
I receive called from the same person 3 times. I could recognise his voice. First time he claim to be personnel from "MOH" telling me that I was detected to have covid by global health organisation and should be quarantined at home and need to have my personal details. I told him that since he called me, he should have my details. The second call he made to my house number was he was from DBS and asked me why I hadn't paid for my credit card bill. Today he called again to tell me he was from DBS and I told him that i recognise his voice and asked him not to be stupid to try scamming, I could already recognise his voice. When he realised he got caught, he got angry and hung up.
A guy called and wanted me (and he managed to call out my name also) to guess who he was (a few times) and tried to make me feel guilty for not identifying him when "others" could recognise by his voice. After a while, I got sick of this "guess me" game that I just said "take it as i having memory loss simply tell me who you are lah!!" since not able to get me to say a name, he simply said he got another call coming in and "ttyl" to me... Came back home and check this website and noted that this mobile 83796312 also appears here in other case(s).
I came across a job ad on instagram which was linked to FB (Jobs Finding). I went to PM the person in Whatsapp. Then he introduced to me to this website. This website required me to create an account. The job required me to do 40 products reviews every day. Commissions would be given for each product reviewed. However, only until 40th review was done, was I able to withdraw the money. The top up amount got more and more. I decided to stop topping up. I went to make a report about scam. I already topped up $1338 on second day. This started from 3/8/2022. and report was made 4/8/2022
I am writing this to report a suspected scam call. Recently, I received phone calls which claims there is a notification from the Ministry of Health. At first, the caller is a robot said “you have an important notification from the Ministry of Health. We tried several times but cannot contact you. For English conversation, press 1; for Mandarin, press 2.” Days before I pressed 1 and 2 but there was no response. Today I received the call again and pressed 2, and a man talked with me. Here is the conversation of the 1st call: “Please tell me your name.” [I provided my name and spelled it] “Ok, There is two things to inform you. Firstly, how many doses did you vaccinated?” [Two doses, I said] “You have to take the third and forth dose of vaccination. I will sign up for you, you can go to nearby clinic to be vaccinated.” “Your voice is blurry, are you stay in home or outside?” [I am in shopping mall now, I said] “Are you hanging out with friends?” [with friends, I said] “When would you go back to home? I’ll contact you later while it will take some time to verify your documents.” [About 5:00pm, I said] “5:00pm is the time we get off work …but I think it is ok. My name is Li Guoyou, please remember this name since I will contact you again.” [OK, and I think I will go back to home more quickly and 4:30pm is ok to receive a call. I said] “Ok.” Here is the conversation of 2nd call: “I am Li Guoyou from the Ministry of Health, and the second thing is an important Covid-19 notification. However, we are still verifying your documents. Could I call you tomorrow?” [No problems, I have spare time all the time tomorrow. I said] “Then I will call you at 8:15am. Would it disturb your morning exercise or else plan?” [No it won’t. I said.] “Ok, I will call you tomorrow. Sorry for taking your time.” [Thank you. I said.] After that, I realized it is ridiculous that the caller do not know my name but have an important notification for me. I suspected it is a scam call and report to you. Here is the detailed time and phone number of the calls. The 1st call: 15:09 p.m. +65 85941515 The 2nd call: 16:59 p.m. 92757395 Hope the information would be useful to address similar cases, if it is a scam call.
Person called to say he’s my friend who lost his phone and to update my phone book with this new number. He called several days later to say he needed help updating his bank with this new number before he can pay his supplier. He then say he cant rem his security answer and his bank account is locked. He then asked me to help paynow his supplier first on his behalf. I called his wife to verify if this is true. Turns out there was no such thing.
A lady by the name of @adelgunDephaerl followed me on IG. We started off CHATTING as frIends and Brought our conversation to WhatsApp. She said she was performing transactional data for dior and asked if i have ever Shopped online. On a Friday night, she said that she has too many orders to FULFIL and asked if i could help her with some. I asked if its legal and whether It was okay for non-employees to help out. She said that she has done it for about 2 years and that Dior is an established company. Furthermore, she Told me to contact their customer Support which was using a business account for orders. She enticed me with a reward for newcomers and I decided to try it out. For the first 2 orders, it started off with $110 and $680. After completing the first 2, I gained a total commission of $50. Until the third order, it became a large sum. I thought it was for 1 transaction and the “so-called” customer support said it was for multiple products after my first transaction. I decided to complete the transaction in full and they said that I had to do it again. For this time, I complied and told Judy about it. She did the “transfer” on her part So I felt that it was okay to continue. Never did I realise That it became a double order and the “so-called” customer support told me to transfer to another account. It was then I felt suspicious and decided to report it to the police. These happened within a span of 2 hours. I hope that my intervention On this case is timely enough for the police to recover the lost funds. After a week I was scammed, the “so-called” customer support for Dior rebranded to channel. They are going on another spree to scam other victims. Do keep a lookout for any tasks from Chanel or Dior and report to the police immediately!!! One month later, I received a follow request on ig from the same person using another username called @zixiqwe. I rejected it immediately and went to the police to furnish this piece of information. Hopefully it will allow the police to generate some leads and arrest the scammer.
This lady named Gina, who claimed to be a HR from "FTV LABS" asked me if I was looking for a job. They have my full name as per my NRIC, which is worrying. Thank goodness for this scam alert website. I googled the company name and found other articles here. I sent her the links to these articles and told her never to contact me again.
I posted my item on Carousell for sale. Then a customer contacted me saying that he didn’t have paynow and that he would like to purchase my item, he would pay by courier Fedex. Then he sent me a Fedex link starting with the https://fedex.dealf.online/. He informed me that he already paid for the courier fee and was waiting for me to receive the money from him via Fedex. In the link there's a verified sign in front of the website as you can see in the photo once i click on the Fedex logo on the website it routed me to the main fedex website (real fedex website) as well. Once I clicked receive funds they will ask for the card information then they'll ask for the otp which I didn't input the otp. A few seconds later i received an auto message from the bank about my otp and that I conducted a transaction on my card, which I didn’t.So, I cancelled my visa.Please beware of phishing scams and do not click on links that look dubious.

Wanted to get a massage and came across a girl named lele in locanto website. Told to go to Yishun blk 744, told me to take a picture of the place and said her friend will call me via WhatsApp for security reason. Then a +60 number called me and ask me to buy some razor card credits as form of payment, i straightaway told him off and said i only pay cash else cancel the appointment. This was when he started to threaten me and i scolded him big time and hang up on him. He then started sending me many pictures of bloody guys been beaten up, i just block the number and forward my handphone to my residential number which i didn’t connect at home… (let him call and get frustrated) For those who experiencing the same scam, be assured the scammer will not be able to: 1. Track your address based on your phone number. 2. No one will go to your place to harass you as these so called gangsters are based in probably china (+60 number), and who in singapore will act for them without being paid? They can only threaten you online, and if you block and ignore them, they will soon direct their attention to other people instead of wasting time on you.

This guy eric whatsapp me and claimed to be the recruitment director of FTV LABS PTE.LTD. according to him , he claimed that it was a social media hype job to increase the visibility of social media celebrities on TikTok, just follow their celebrities on TikTok and get paid for liking and following them. Besides liking tik tok videos, there are also tasks from what they claimed to be their merchants, rewards for each task are different, and we will get paid for completing the task, with varying amounts of commission. On the same day, eric told me to add his receptionist via telegram. The username was @mary56888 who added me into the workgroup whereby tasks will be shared by telegram user @ftvlabs. For the first task, i was directed to choose the tier of commission and transfer the amount to some unknown account. I was also directed to sign up for account on a website with some wierd domain (Web.797866.xyz) provided by the scammers. Another telegram user @alan323 was the one who guided me the steps to perform the necessary task in the website. For the first round, i received the money. After which, a second task was posted few hours later. This was a group task whereby the task had to be done by a group. Once again, I selected the tier. However, after completing the task for my selected tier, @alan323 said there was another task (minimum tier is transfer of $5000) where were required to be completed before we ca n receive the full commission. I sensed something was amiss and decided not to proceed further. I did not receive any money at all as they told me I did not complete the task. I proceeded to alert the workgroup that this is all a scam and @ftblabs removed me from the group chat. Just to share, the transactions of the job taskings is as follows: 7693232??? Uob ang jia qi 1002974??? cimb lim shee hui des??? 1002982??? cimb donovan tock qiu ???
I received a call from 8551 0052 on 1 August 2022 at around 13:39 SGT. The caller addressed me by my English name and asked, in Singaporean/Malaysian mandarin, if I recognized his voice. I replied no, but the caller insisted that we knew each other and was disappointed that I did not recognize his voice. I asserted again that I did not recognize him and asked him for his name. He said his name was Kelvin, to which I replied I do not know a Kelvin. The caller subsequently hung up upon realizing that I was not an easy target. The scammer did not send any messages after the call. a quick search of the caller's phone number (8551 0052) on google revealed that the caller has attempted the same modus operandi on others.
Met this British through ig (https://www.instagram.com/__fin_lay). His Whatsapp number +447868693687 and +447883183162 (business account but lost his phone). We chatted about 1.5 month starting june. similar to other stories here, he moved to Glasgow since young after his dad passing, consultant engineer and entrepreneur, shared soapy stories about how he got cheated by ex gf, talked about future with you, going to marry you, showed love and care everyday without fail, shared his photos with his mom and videos/selfies regularly, also shared photos of his daily life etc. The most ridiculous part was he lost his passport and wallet during his business trip in Istanbul and asked me to wire him $2k in order for him to survive. I told him I couldn't transfer money internationally then he found his ways to ask me to wire to some contacts in sg then they could wire the money to him. He even showed me the police report to prove that he really lost his passport. I've done my research and found out that isn't right with the passport number. Uk passport number only comprises 9 digits but in his police report shows 10 digits. Just like other victims here, he also "send" gifts to me, only 2 weeks later i received a WhatsApp message to pay $4850 for the delivery and clearance fees. So i've again confirmed it's a scam and probably it is running by a group of ppl behind. My friend did a reverse image search and found out that this scammer has been using other ppl's images to impersonate and scam for money. No money was lost.
I was on Facebook dating and this guy approached me claiming to be a rich interior designer with a sick mother and started chatting. Within a week, he was declaring his undying love for me and asking me to travel with him as he wants me to be his wife someday. He tried to elicit my sympathy by saying his ex cheated on him and obtain my personal information like my name, age, nationality and marital status even though I kept insisting I am poor and jobless. He kept forgetting details i had shared with him before which made me suspicious, and after a while of talking he tried to get me to click on an internet link to "help his older sister" which was a non-verified app by a China website. He kept calling and getting angry when I refused to download the app and asked for a picture of him and his sister. I blocked him on all social media platforms.
The incoming call from +65 87314177 on 31 july,1145am was a Chinese speaking Singaporean who asked me if I remembered who he was, and he claims to know me, and can even call out my actual name. I kept asking him back who he is and he refused to answer me, and instead wanted me to come out with the name myself, as typical to that already reported on news. I then cancelled the call and called back on the listed number and the person actually picked it out and answered.
I have the phone call at about 12:30 30/july from the scammer. It was firstly a record of voice, saying that i had missed some important information sent to me by the “MOH” singapore.And it asked me to press 2 for mandarin service. I pressed 2 a man came to talk to me. He firstly said: what is your question? I described my conditions. And he said that there was information about my vaccination status that was to be delivered to me by “MOH”. He then asked for my name to confirm online. I told him my name. He then said that he confirmed and found that i was considered to have spread rumour about covid-19.I then came around and hanged up the phone.
An advertisement in Facebook regarding jobs hiring. So i went to click in and the person mentioned she was from Shopee and have a job offer. After she transferred me to another person, they said the job is to purchase a product. After purchased, the money will return to me with commissions. However, the product is getting expensive each time. They said that I needed to top up money in order to get back my money, i transferred a total of $25000 which includes my family and friends money. And the person went mia afterwards. I then realised it is a scam. Now I owe people more than 20k and i don’t know how to return them the money. Beware guys of this scam!
Scammer called me and claimed that he was someone I know and just changed his hp as he had lost his hp. I thought he was my client pa Andrew and he acknowledged. he asked me to update his number. I didn't make notice as I was busy at work. Then he called me again asking me to help him check about DBS Internet banking .. I was busy so I didn’t attend to him. he WhatsApp me later the images. then I share some screenshot with him on how to update his otp contact number. he later called me and said he still cannot change and can only go to the bank branch tomorrow to update. then he said he need to make an urgent transfer for a payment. he said he asked his friends to help and short of $1500. he asked me for help. I rejected him as I told him I'm not close to him. then he tried to lower the amount. immediately I sense something is amiss. anyway I hang up as I was busy with my work. shortly I called the real Andrew to confirm. He didn't change his hp. I did not transfer any money to him.
Person called in Mandarin and English (probably Malaysian from accent) and was able to call me by my name. He kept asking me to guess who he was. When I asked who he was again and said he called the wrong number, he confidently said my name and that we met up last week and went out to a place that I did not go to.
Received a call from 8436 5418 claiming to be my friend on 28/jul/2022. He was able to call out my name, and thinking that he was someone I knew, I asked him who he was. He then asked me to guess who he was. I told him that I couldn't, and he mentioned he was "Daniel". When I asked for his surname, and more later on, he hung up.
He called me and was very friendly pretending to be a close contact but waiting for me to disclose who he is based on voice recognition. He claimed he lost his wallet and mobile phone and requested me to update the contact. Next day, he called and requested payment for him to facilitate his application. As I didn't save his contact and asked who he is again, he could not answer and left the call.
Received a call from 86161524 at 13:29pm. The person called me by my name and spoke in Mandarin. He claimed to be my friend who changed his phone number. I was already feeling that something was off, I re-confirmed with him who is he calling, he cannot call my name correctly I said you call wrong number. The caller said "sorry sorry" then hung up.
I received a call on my work number and this guy addressed my by my name. He started by saying in mandarin and speaks in a rush tone. " Hi MY NAME, i am calling to inform you that i have changed my number and this is my number. You know who am i or not?" I paused and he continues without letting me think. " Jialat lah, how come you don't remember me? jialat lah, i called you to tell you my number has changed and you don't know me. You try to think, who can i be?" I felt suspicious and he continued repeating these few sentences. Finally after 1m 47s, i hanged up the phone. Always stay calm and keep quiet and be slow to react, we can always hang up and report the case.
Received a Whatsapp call from +1 (508) 206-7747. The woman said she was an investigation officer with the ministry of manpower (mom) and that there had been some illegal activities associated with my FIN. She asked me to verify my fin with her. I said no that I had no way of knowing if she was actually with the mom. She asked me to accept her video call so that I could see her. She sat behind a desk, wearing a mask. Behind her was a white wall with a large MOM logo on it. I told her that did not confirm anything and said I would call MoM to verify.
Recieved a call mentioning that i enquired a loan before, was in a meeting hence i ask them to send me details to my email instead. then i was contacted via whatsapp. i asked for their uen(201828743E) and checked online that it was legit. so when he asked for my details to check my eligibility, i provided him my nric, payslip and 2 close contact numbers. then he said i am eligible but will need to do a trial loan where he will transfer me $500, but i need to transfer back $800. if i am unable to, he will put the $300 in the loan i enquired to take ($1000+$300). i said i dont understand, please send me a agreement for me to read the terms before confirming anything. few moments later, i received a transfer of $500 in my bank, they gotten my bank account details from my payslip and ask me to confirm the transfer. feeling really uneasy as i didnt confirm anything, i called the UEN company hotline to check, and the admin lady replied that i have encountered a scam as all loans have to be process in the office only. Knowing that i told the guy i would like to cancel, and now become i have to pay a cancellation fee. i made a police report and also informed the bank. At the moment they are threatening to come and chop me and they had put an order on my name to look for me. it is very stressful as police cant help much until they actually come knocking on the door… The bank will take 30-45days to do their investigations.
*beware of Impersonation calls* 25Jul - Received a call from 83511448 and i picked up. The person called me by my name and spoke in Mandarin. He claimed to be my friend who changed his phone number. I asked for his name repeatedly and the caller asked me to guess. The person had Malaysian accent and I have no male friends who sounded like this so I hung up.

And till now she acted as a victim and asked me to pay her back the money where she didn’t even transfer me a single cent. Her number; 80471426, 81714566.
Loan company provided "official documents" and "system snapshots" from bank stating secured loan required ‘MAS’ validation, rectification charges, meps, origination fee. Promised to disburse the loan but did not happen. The officers cannot be contacted.https://www.apply.tml-pte-ltd.com/
I chanced upon an advertisement on facebook regarding about a personal loan. I provided my personal particulars (contact , name and email). A day later a fella named Roy claimed that he was from "icredit" company contacted me via WhatsApp text and asked if I was looking for any personal loan. I said yes and he proceeded to ask me to pay for $500 as a "loan insurance" for personal accidents,death etc etc. He even mentioned "if any of above situation, this insurance will cover 100% of your payment thru out your loan period" . Since it was my first time taking loan, I agreed . proceeded to pay $500 for this 4K loan sum. Awhile later he told me he accidentally extended my loan to 8K and I am required to pay another $500. So thinking i could get 8K, i borrowed money from my friend and I transferred money over. So I transferred 1000 on the same day. The next morning, he texted me that he needed another 500 as he said that I transferred to the wrong acc. I needed to transfer another 500. So i borrowed another 500 from my friend and transferred to him to another acc. How I discovered that this was a scam because they asked me for another $500 as this one a one time policy thing since previously I transferred wrong and stuff like that. They said If I transferred another $500, they will stop asking and give me back my full 8000+1500 i have transferred. When asked if this was a scam, he said he wouldn't scam and said that if he want to scam he would have scam at least 5000 why bother with 500....
Received a call from +65 8374 3677 at 8:21pm. I cancelled the call. Received a call from the same number again. This time i picked up. The person called me by my name and spoke in Mandarin. He claimed to be my friend who changed his phone number. I asked for his name repeatedly and the caller asked me to guess. The caller claimed to be my friend Who live in Woodlands and asked me to list the name of friends living in Woodlands. I said my friends who live in Woodlands were not Chinese. The caller then hung up.

Hope this serves as a PSA for all!
I always get a call from a recorded message posing as MOH. +6598730036 was the number that called me today. The caller could only speak in Mandarin. When asked how come MOH staff cannot speak English, they said how come you don't know MOH had a Chinese department. I called them out on their immoral behaviour and they got upset, said I said I needed to take responsibility for my words and hung up. What a class act.
I received a phone call from "ICA" mentioning that they will stop my singpass account. The person on the call was a CHINESE officer named: lee jian feng. He told me to visit the building #03-302 s208718 in person COS MY PHONE NO. HAS BEEN USED TO SPREAD COVID RUMOURS IN GUANG ZHOU. I FOUND IT'S A SCAM CALL. I refused to follow their instructions and hang up the phone. Then i tried call real ica hotline but the lines are busy. Please beware of scam calls from fake ICA!!!!!
I received a call from a man who kept asking me to guess who he was. Once I mentioned 'Charles', he exclaimed and said I totally have forgotten who him, acting all friendly. He said he called to let me know that he changed his mobile number and called to let me know. the next day, he called me and asked for help as he was having difficulty in updating his mobile number in his DBS account. Later, he called again to let me know he was locked out of his account and again asked for help to transfer some money to his client. He mentioned it was SGD 2,500 but asked for transfer of SGD 1000. By this point, I was already feeling that something was off. I called a common friend regarding Charles' number number being changed and called his old number (i had already replaced it) to confirm, it was a SCAM. After which i blocked the scammer's number and that scammer knew that I found out and deleted any mention of the said account i was suppose to transfer to. Which was a pity as I could have added that to my police report
Met this girl on michat. so added on Whatsapp, agree to meet at tampines st 42. as she'll not accept cash because afraid of "police fishing". asked to buy itunes card 100$ initially, then ask for another 600 for "risk" then another 400 for "verification", I refused to pay and they started to called/message/send threatening messages/voice messages/videos using different numbers (+601172421553/+60176491969). as i was scared, he ask for another $500 which i did transfer to him, and he call for another $500, i realise is a scam, the guy told me to pay him if not he would come my house and threaten my family and I thought after giving some amount of money, he would be gone but he kept on coming so I told myself: "i am very stupid to be scammed by people online" and I would like to advise everyone to be careful of these scams. Obviously, these are scammers posing themselves as "gang members" so that people will be frightened and give in. In the past, real "gang member" will not identify themselves nor will they betray their "gang" code of conduct. Even if there is till "gang member" in Singapore, they'll lie low and not proudly identify themselves to create troubles. Beware of adding people in michat with +60 phone number with Line ID. I am a victim and I would not want anyone to be part of it as well. Report to the police if he/she continues to harass you!
Received a call from 85510052 (no + sign). caller had a Malaysian accent. He was able to say my Chinese name. He said he was my friend and that he lost his phone yesterday when he went to jb to eat. He got a new number and wanted to call and let me know the number. I asked him who he was and he disappointedly said, "you cannot recognize my voice?" I said I did not know who he was. he was trying to get me to bring up a friend's name. He ended the call by saying that he will send me a WhatsApp message and I can view his profile pic. No message was received after the call.
They called (first an automatic phone bot asked me to press a button), and said something about an urgent governmental information/document having not been collected by me. A fine would be pending ('by today afternoon'), and that I would now have to pay a lot of money to comply.. They first asked me for my full name and passport number.
I received an robocall claiming to be from Ministry of Health regarding covid contact tracing. Asked me to press 1 etc. to interact with the automated system Please beware of such scam calls.
Phishing SMS URL leads to a clone Singpass side to try getting Singpass details: POSB: At the request of IRAS, we have closed your account related to the tax investigation until you cooperate with a full tax review: https://bit.ly/0s-ig [NOTE: Phishing website. DO NOT click]
i was browsing facebook marketplace and had chance upon this sponsored ad which promotes job as an online e-commerce part time job. the details of picture shown would be as follows: daily commission: $100 - $300 ads showing shopee/lazada app logos language used: english/chinese time flexibility (can be done from home in mobile/computer platforms) clicked to learn more about as I do want to earn some additional cash as a side hustle. the contact person would then whatsapp you to do some sort of mini interview asking for your age (do keep in mind that they apparently have an age requirement). then the person would introduce about the company as per following in summary (which I suspect that they are using a real company as a disguise) our company workday is founded in 2005 and registered in Singapore at 2015. it is a leading enterprise integration platform that automates product data. main job is to help sellers create complete data products (aka product reviews). system would generate 40 data for us to create and we have complete 40 data . (these information provided from them are legit company, there is an uen number for tracking and status is "live" but technically speaking at a later point I find that these business information can be bought from acra website at $5.50 and they could re-use the format and amend the contact person details and save it as a pdf to make it look legit) 2 sets of account would be used in this case. one will be your own and the other is from the person who contact you. there would be a guidance phase where you will be given 40 data to update your "product reviews" and there would be a chance for you to get 3x commission if you are lucky and each time u encounter the 3x commission, your balance would become negative and you are require to top up the negative amount. all this will be done from the contact person's account first and after 3 tries, you would be using your own account. now here comes the trap, as you are doing the 40 sets of data from your own account. you will encounter more 3x commission than usual. meaning your negative balance would keep on increasing and increasing to the point you are very cash tight. after that I kind of just went mia on them as I felt something is amiss. overall, I take this as a learning lesson and it is a painful one... lost over 5k just because I was blinded with the easy commission.

I refused to follow their instruction and hang up the phone directly. then i tried call real ica hotline but the lines are busy. Please beware of scam calls from fake ICA!!!!!
my experience happened on 13 july and it is similar to the story related on 11 july on this scam alert website. it was the same scammer named anthony p. he wanted the item sent to a person named vivian pedrosa in malaysia. After several e mail exchanges between me and him, he sent me an e mail informing me of the transfer confirmation sent from citibank intl team. the e mail address was transferoffice@usa.com. I did not continue with the transaction as i found it strange that i had to sent a shipment tracking number/recept before i could receive payment. i decided to e mail him to tell him that I would not be sending the item without full payment first. when i suggested that he found another mode of payment, he replied that the bank transfer was the only mode of payment he had. i then politely told him that i was not comfortable with the transaction. His response was also "K"!
It all happened on 8Jul 2022. SOMEONE (with Malaysian accent) called me ( I think he addressed me by my name) telling me he has changed his CONTACT and he called just to tell me he CHANGEd his contact. I recalled years back, someone also called me to tell me he changed his number ,so I wondered if I knew this guy. I HAVE ASKED HIM MORE THAN ONCE WHO HE was. HIS REPLIED WAS ("WE SO CLOSE, YOU CANNOT RECOGNIZE MY VOICE MEH") he tried to be friendly but didn't SHARE his name. I have many Malaysian friends and mutual friends so after 2 times I didn't asked further. Later he whatsapped me to ASK me to save his number. Later on the same day, he whatsapped me, and asked if I know how to change phone number in Dbs. I linked him the dbs link. At night, he called me and told me he was unable to change his contact in the app and asked if I can help him to transfer money to someone. I smelt something not right, he asked if I can HELP him by TRANSFERring $1500, I told him politely, it's not possible. And later, he asked if I was afraid he don't return me, trying to laugh it off. I then replied genuinely saying yes, I was afraid. He asked twice. And I replied the same After that incident, I realised he could have knew my name by WhatsApp. The scammers are getting cleverer in their tactic. Luckily, no one was hurt or scammed here. I would like to share this to everyone and remind to be vigilant at all times.
Sent me an SMS. Saying this: Dear customer, Your shipment No. IL1001298312SG has arrived in Singapore and requires payment of customs duties and taxes: bit.ly/3at8k9Z (Note: Scam site. Do NOT click) I bought some items online so I thought maybe it was real. So I clicked — The link brings you to a website with the Singpost logo to make it look credible. The page will prompt you to pay a small amount of money that you think is negligible ($2.80). But you have to key in your credit card details. A red flag was that it was asking for shipping customs duties and taxes at all. Singaporeans know you only pay customs if you buy more than $400. Another red flag was the website URL was nothing related to singpost —despite the site using the Singpost logo (which can be easily copied from online) — which is suspect BC official Singpost would have a legitimate website URL. So, I went to search the Singpost website, and found if you do need to pay customs for Singpost you can only do it on their Singpost app or at a Sam machine —anything else asking you to pay online or through an SMS is fake / a scam. Editor's Note: You can verify the shipment details by checking the shipment number of your order before clicking on the URL. Please log into your e-commerce account to look up for the details.
A Malaysian accent voice called and say changed hp number, and repeated twice on asking you if you remember who is him. this time round, the phone number doesn't have "+65" anymore. (I hung up the phone after that because i have received such phone call before,) take note that nowadays, it doesn't have +65 anymore.
I received an unknown call and caller was able to address me by my name and told me that he got his number changed. I didn't heed their request and hung up. Wanted to share my info so that you the rest can be aware of this scam.
I was contacted over Carousell message by someone asking to buy a pair of yeezy sneakers via email instead of Carousell. When i sent this person an email, he claimed that he wanted the shoe delivered to Malaysia and that he would pay via PayPal or bank transfer. After providing him a quote for postage and payment methods i accepted, he said that his PayPal was dormant and that he would do a bank transfer instead. A day later he sent me an email saying the bank transfer was complete and to check my email for the confirmation, however he also said his bank needed proof of postage to release the funds. I checked the confirmation email he said Citibank sent - not only did the email look fishy (font was in purple, no Citibank branding, very strangely worded) the email address was also not from Citibank (transferoffice@usa.com) hence i immediately suspected it was fake. Also thought it was strange why i had to prove the item was shipped before funds were released. I googled the email address transferoffice@usa.com and found similar stories here about the same scammer using the same name (anthony) which confirmed to me that this was fraudulent. I wrote back to the scammer telling him that I was suspicious and not willing to take the risk and all I got in response was “k” over email. Have also reported his account to Carousell. Stay safe and deal via Carousell only!

I was approached by a lady name Wendy Eng from telegram she texted me several times if I'm interested to know about a job with daily commission of $10-$200. I didn't reply but she was persistent so I give her a chance to share. Subsequently, she referred me to her agent, jacelyn. She added me into a telegram group chat of 12 people and shared that i have to register a login via the website and the step by step guide to do the hotel rating and withdrawal of commission. The first set was free of charge as the company have top up $105 for new user to trial and complete a set of 35 Hotel ratings. I received my commission of $11 and was told to withdraw via paynow. Group members started messaging me to tell me how long they have been into this and how it have help them build some passive income. I was skeptical but they assured me its legit and encourage me to renew in order to complete another set of 35 hotel ratings. After much thoughts I renewed, The admin mention I need to deposit $105 so that I could start (reason: It is the same as booking a hotel and complete the rating) And i could withdraw the $105 plus commission after i complete 35 ratings. Payment mode via paynow. So I embarked on my second set of rating. At the 17th ratings , i was given a deluxe package which is 5x the commission I thought I was lucky. However, the system did not allow me to continue and my deposit become negative. I asked the admin and was explained that it is a system assign bonus, in order to continue i need to deposit more money to the froze account and I deposited $400 to continue. at the 25th rating I have another deluxe package and my deposit became negative, admin again explained i need to deposit $600 to continue, and i did. again at the 32th rating I was given another deluxe package, same thing my DEPOSITs become negative and was told to deposit another 2.5k. I came to realised that something is not right and threaten to report to the police, they say I can go ahead as they have lawyer to support the case and was advised to deposit so that I can finish my set of 35 ratings to withdraw all my deposits and commission. I didn't continue anymore and ignore all the chats and telegram.
Similar experience to: https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-02Sep2021120520PM https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-06Aug2020120421PM First received a call on 6 Jun 2022. Mentioned about some upcoming events in SG (11 Jun 2022). Did not go for the event. Next call received was on 29 Jun 2022. Mentioned that even though I did not attend the event, but because I picked up the first call, I became eligible for their lucky draw. And I won the third prize in their lucky draw, worth HKD 590,000, which is more than SGD 100,000. I mentioned I wasn't interested at first, but caller, who sounds like a Taiwanese lady, was persistent in asking if I really wanted to give up SGD 100,000+. I figured I'll just see what info they'll ask for. After 1 hour of some background info about the company, and some random chatter, I gave some personal info to her, including full name (English and Chinese), mobile number, date of birth, and my NRIC number. She mentioned she needed to submit the application form, so will get back to me the next day. The next day, she mentioned the application was successful, and asked for my bank account number to transfer the money to. I gave it to them, as I didn't perceive a risk. At this point, I was more convinced it was real, but still retained a bit of skepticism. The next day, she called to chit chat for about 20 minutes (I think they are trying to put a personality to your identity through these exchanges), before telling me she can only give me an update the next week as they don't work on the weekends. No other information retrieved from me. Over the weekend, I tried to search if there are scams that are similar to this, and found them here on scamalert.sg. After comparing too many similarities, I realised I was being scammed. The next time the lady called (Mon), I listened to her for about 5 minutes, and just ended the call without saying anything. She has not called back since.
It happened when I posted my iphone for sale in Carousell. The scammer contacted me via Carousell to express his interest. He only mentioned that he will be on online carousell for a short period and will be offline and requested my mobile number to chat via WhatsApp. He told me he will be making payment via overseas transfer, as he didn’t have a local bank account. He told me the remittance will only reflect in the local bank system after 2 days. I agreed because he told me he would share with me his passport details for proof that he is genuine in buying. Then, he shared with him a screenshot of his payment via Bank of America and his passport details. He requested for me to courier the phone out to him on the same day, as it meant for his brother as a birthday gift, and his brother is flying off soon. My hubby found something amiss with his request. It’s only a gift. So we decided to call off the deal. He told me he will take back the funds that he had transferred, which I agreed. He was not happy and kept on persuading me to accept his offer. He then shared a link with me via WhatsApp, asking me to help him register for a local SIM card so that he could transfer the money to him via Paynow. I didn’t agree to the request, and told him that I’m truly calling off the deal. After that he stopped contacting me. Carousell has since taken down his account.
Someone else here also shared a similar story. On the first day, I received a call from someone who claimed to know me that he lost his bag with his phone and wallet in it. He asked me to guess who he was. Upon guessing he said that yes, it was him. he also invited me to go down to his friends newly opened cafe this weekend. Om day 2, he called to say that he needed to pay his supplier's deposit of SGD$5900. he asked to send him through Paynow to a different person's name. He also mentioned that it will be returned by end of day. Upon further questioning, he is unable to state why his company cannot handle the payment, and unable to give the suppliers' company name and details. I hung up and didn't transfer him money
Carousell buyer (username: atthnteoncleehwte) by the name of anthony expressed interest on 25 jun 2022 to purchase a piece of clothing i had put up on sale on carousell, and offered to schedule meetup or post. He then moved the conversation to his email (jjhtt937@gmail.com) He requested for the item to be delivered to this address, and I received an email from citi-group (transferoffice@usa.com) asking me to give the transaction details/tracking number so that funds can be released to my bank account. i sent the item via postage on 4 july 2022. Name : Natalia Perry Address : A-5-1,Casa Indah 1 Condo, PJU 3, Kota Damansara, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Zip code : 47410 State : Selangor City : Petaling Jaya Country : Malaysia Post providing the transaction no. on 4 july 2022, I received another email from citi-group (TRANSFEROFFICE@USA.COM) that my account had not received USA funds transfer before, and therefore requires me to transfer $495 of " refundable activation fee" to this bank account: Account Number - 7630552937 Account Holder's Name - Husu Ging Bank Name - CIMB Bank (Malaysia) Swift Code - CIBBMYKLXXX Bank Address: 45 Dato Yusoff Shahbudin Tama 41200 Klang Selangor Kuala Lumpur Malaysia Receiver’s address: 25 Vista Lavender Apt Taman Persiaran Kinrara Seksyen 3 47190 Puchong Selangor Malaysia As it is highly unusual for the bank to request for account activation fee, I checked email address and realised that the email address was suspicious. Also googled and noted a recent scam story posted on this website which had similar details. I reported the account to Carousell to prevent others from getting scammed.
Received a call from the High court of Singapore, the name of the first caller was Isaac, he explained that my details was used since march 1 using an ICBC platinum card with cc#48152500040xxxxx. They said my amount to pay way $9,628.90 and that I opened that account in the Chinatown Branch and that the address used for that account is 997 Bukit Timah Rd. Unit #09-04 s589633. He proceeded and told me that i should file a police report and that he will transfer me to the police force. After a few minutes, he transferred me to the police force where they asked for my FIN, passsport number, name and address. They said that they needed the info to file the report and threatened me that I was one of the suspects for money laundering. They tried to extort me for my bank account number as well but I didn't give. I am scared that they my use all my personal details or sell my personal details online. So, please beware of such requests and not be pressured into giving personal details.
This person called and said me by my name and said he just changed his number. He had a strong Malaysian accent. He also asked me to guess who he is and said that he was someone that I talked to with daily and how can i forget him just because he changed number. I told him that I really cant recall who he was. But he insisted I knew who he is and said his name begins with a j. There after he say he will drop me a message and proceeded to end the call. This is obviously a scam!
A person texted me on telegram to rate hotels &amp; guided me step by step. After signing on the website - https://www.zehnderpteltd.net/web, they added me to a group chat of ard 30 pax. The people in the chat kept talking about rating hotels and depositing money to 'renew' the job so that we can make more money and kept encouraging me to deposit money. I withdrew the 1st $10 then they made me deposit $118, saying that this could be withdrawn along with the commission for rating hotels. if I did not renew then I could not continue with rating hotels. I thought I was very "lucky" and got a luxury hotel rating which would give me a huge sum of money then my account balance became negative and i needed to top up money to withdraw this huge lucky amount. i did not and said i will report this to the police and they said that I didn't know what I are talking about and asked me what happened. Thankfully, I did not transfer anymore money to them after feeling something amiss.
Received a call on day 1, did not provide a name but said he is someone close and recently changed phone number, asking me to guess who it was. upon saying he name, he said yes that's right and carried on with the conversation. he mentioned that he changed numbers and lost his bank card as well.he was opening a cafe with a friend and would like to invite us down to eat when it opens. Day 2, he called to say supplier had sent goods, but because of blocked/unactivated bank card, unable to make payment. requested help to make payment to one NG CHEE MING MESSI. red flags: 1) Caller will never be the one telling you who they are as they don't know your friends' name! 2) Whatsapp doesn't have a profile picture 3) not giving the name of the shop or the supplier is not a proper uen no.
Claimed that I have a document case file that needed to be collected from Singapore high court. Prompted me to press "2". Scammer asked me for my case no. and I told him "How should I know?" He should know better since he made the call to me. Asked him what is the SHC telephone no. scammer gave some other number that is not listed online. I informed him i will be report this call to the police and HUNG up.
Scammer was able to call me by my name and claimed to be my friendI received a call from 89276759 and caller kept insisting that I knew him when I couldn't even recognise his voice. He claimed to be my friend and called me by my name. I still couldn't remember. In the end, he said he was "Kelvin", which happened to really be one of my friends' name. Then, he claimed that his wallet &amp; hp has been stolen and this is his new hp number. today, he called again. he said he is facing some problem on transfering funds to his supplier and ask for my help to borrow him some money and he will return me the money by today before 4.30pm. I felt weird because my friends whose called "kelvin" all are my working partners and our relationship wouldn't be so close for me to lend him money. I refused him and asked him should looking for help from his supplier or the company instead of me.
message from this guy called tony wang. he mentioned Ig pushed my account to him hence he was interested to make friends. we chat and he proceeded to ask me to chat via whatsapp instead. he started to follow me on instagram quite often and we chatted almost everyday. slowly, he said he wished to give me some money to spend and sent me a link to https://h5.wmfro.life/#/pages/login/login [Note: Scam site. Do not click] to create an account. obviously I refused but he created an account and deposited usd500 for into that account. the following night he convinced me to do some "investment" with him by transaction some money into the cycles and there are times where you get some returns, all in all the "investment" from usd500 increased to usd585 and he told me to encash it out so that the next time when we meet i can return him the money if i do not want it. subsequently he did get me to put in like 5k but i rejected and told him i do not have money. kind of fought by he continued to chat along and after a month later, he decided to get me to put in 30k instead. The account this platform used to allow you to transfer to is a personal account from standard chartered bank, and the account holder is called salamah bte ma???? with a paynow number of 8944 8???. I did not lost any money from this though as I kept insisting i do not have enough money. just sharing some details here so that others can be more vigilant on these type of scam when they do google search on certain phone numbers or account details.
Received a call that attempted to impersonate MOH. I was asked to select the language of the call, so I picked English. But a guy who could only speak in Mandarin picked up and when I requested to speak in English, he hung up.
Buyer (atricialeeeltnhwte) expressed interest for a Fossil watch through Carousell app on 26 Jun 4.30 pm. Asked me to email him at jjlt3298@gmail.com to schedule meetup or post. He asked me to post the package to a Malaysia address &amp; I received an email from Citibank (transferoffice@usa.com) asking me to provide tracking details before payment will be released to my bank account. Name : Natalia Perry Address : A-5-1, Casa Indah 1 Condo, PJU 3, Kota Damansara, Petaling Jaya, Selangor 47410, Malaysia Tel : 0116736784 After I posted the package at 5.39 pm, I emailed the tracking number to both him &amp; Citibank (email does not get through). Sensing that something is amissed, I re-read the email &amp; saw that the bank email address seemed fishy (transferoffice@usa.com) &amp; went down to the Post office to retrieve back my package at 6.59 pm. At 7.41 pm, buyer emailed to me to transfer $490 (verification fees which is refundable) to his Maybank account (11230812???) as my bank account is not activated for a USA transfer. I did not respond to these 2 emails &amp; I called DBS bank to report this incident at 11.30 pm on 27 June. I also made a police report online. While no money was lost, I lost my personal information eg. address, mobile number &amp; bank account number.
Scammer contacted me via telegram. As usual, the tactic is the same for job scams - asked you how old, are you sg, if you want to work part time or full time. Then request to bring convo to Whatsapp. Will tell you to sign up on this website: WWW.KINGSWAYENTER.COM to do the work, then when you needed to withdraw funds, you would be asked to top-up.
I received a job offer about rating hotels and getting commission for it. However, I was very sceptical so I asked for some verification. In order to fool me, they even produced a business card with a local agency called "skyline". The person even showed me a name card with her name on it. However, later on after I set up everything with them they asked me to deposit money blindly into the system to earn more commission, I was very suspicious because it didn't make sense for me to pay in order to earn money. So, I looked up for more info on ScamAlert, did some research turns out there was already a victim of this scam. Please watch out for such job offers on Telegram.
Was contacted via Telegram to by the scammer who was offering a job to rate hotels I was guided to register an account on their work platform and was given the job of rating hotels. A total of 32 hotels had to be rated in order for me to withdraw my commission. I was able to withdraw $11 from them but they said that in order for me to continue with rating another round of 32 hotels, I had to first deposit $118 onto the platform. I was suspicious at first but the scammer reassured me by sending me a picture of her IC. After depositing the $118, I continued rating hotels but before I was able to withdraw my money, I got a "luxury hotel" which meant that I could earn more commission but had to deposit more money to offset my negative account balance. they prompted me to transfer another $364 and I foolishly did so. Within minutes, I got another "luxury hotel" and this time I had to transfer $723 and I almost did so but luckily I was stopped by my Paynow transfer limit and did not manage to transfer the amount in the end. About an hour later, I came across an internet article which had a scam scheme that was almost identical to mine and that was when I realised I got scammed. The whole scheme was quite elaborate and there were a total of 5 parties who contacted me and encouraged me to keep depositing the money. There was also a group chat with 30 members and the chat mainly consisted of casual talk and encouragement to keep on rating hotels. I think some of the main reasons why I fell for this scam is because I was too trusting and wasn't vigilant to spot the scam.
A guy from this number 89285173 called and asked me to guess who he was. I randomly answered him with my colleague's name "Marcus?" and he went "ya lah, you cannot recognise my voice meh?". I was sceptical because he has this Malaysian accent that my colleague doesn't have. He claimed "I having cold so I sound different". So this "Marcus" asked me not to contact his previous number anymore as he already cancelled it, to only contact him via the new number. He called one day later and told me that the bank of his credit card needed more processing time to transfer his money to his new account, requesting for $5.9k. He claimed will return me in the afternoon. I told him I do not have that much of money with me and he started to ask for $1k, or any amount I have with me.Please contact your friend immediately if you receive such call to verify. Do not be in a hurry to lend anyone money!
Contacted you on telegram, and they will ask you to complete hotel rating at https://www.zehnhoteldata.com. You will need to create an account, and they will ask you to deposit your own money in. That was when I called them out and blocked them. Sharing this encounter to raise awareness of the website.
A call came to my mobile number asking if i needed a loan. I rejected right from the start but scammer got furious when I threatened to call the police because he was not supposed to make cold calls to promote loan service. He in turn threatened to cause harm to my family because he knows my address.
Scammer called and asked me to guess who he was - named a friend &amp; he impersonated the friend. Then, he claimed that he's opening a cafe on Saturday, and invited me to try his cafe food for free. the INTRODUCTION SCAM happened yesterday and today he called to borrow money for his cafe opening on this Saturday. I hung up his call and verify it with a mutual friend and confirmed that it wasn't him who made the all. If you receive such calls, pls call your mutual friends to verify or contact the person via other channels to check.
Received this email from 'SP Group" claiming that they billed me twice. Email contained a link which led to a phishing site. Beware guys as these scammers could spoofed to email address that ends with "@spgroup.com.sg", which corresponds with the real company's domain. So read the content of the email and not based only on the sender's address to determine if the email is real or not.

He ended the call by saying he would Whatsapp me in a while and just take a look at the Whatsapp profile picture you will know who he is. Number doesn't have an active WhatsApp as now Whatsapp is able to detect whether the number has an account or not.

I got to know the lady on Facebook dating. Went on to chat on WhatsApp. The scammer sent photos of her in various places in Singapore, and also video of her and friends every now and then, while talking about her day. She also told me her about her past relationships until quite late one night. Then, the next day, she was going to the hospital to check her eyes. We chatted more, and i asked to meet her which she agreed. She even suggested a restaurant in Singapore. At night, asked me to help her to contact another WhatsApp business account (Dior online customer support) to help her with some orders. Immediately I suspected something was not right. I went on to email the official dior customer service to check and got to know that the number for the whatsapp account was most likely a scammer. I immediately reported and blocked her WhatsApp account. After a day, I received an SMS from a Malaysian number (+60176810293) taunting me with some insulting messages. I ignored and blocked the number. I suspect there is an organised group doing these catfishing to cheat money from people. There are numerous accounts on Facebook dating using photos of the lady. Photos may not be the same, but the same lady nonetheless. I hope everyone would be more careful when chatting with strangers online.
Received a call earlier today from above mentioned number mentioning I was having a credit card overdue payment from ICDC bank amounting for SGD $9536. I had to pass my FIN and passport number but but disconnected the call the moment scammer asked me for my present bank details.Editor's Note: Never share your personal details without verification as once the details are shared, scammers are able to use it for their next scam attempt or may even sell them to others.

Got a call from the given number with an automated voice saying that it was an automated call from "MOH" and that my vaccination information is not complete, Press 1 for English and 2 for Chinese. Luckily I pressed 1 for English because the guy who answered could not speak in english and hung up immediately. I only realised that it was likely a scam at that point.
My husband was liaising with a property agent from ERA called Eddy through Whatsapp (88085047, 88145202) with regards to renting a property at 208a and 208b Clementi gateway. My husband got eddy's contact number through this website called directhome.com.sg. However, eddy informed that both units was fully rented out. My husband then asked for my assistance to contact eddy to rent a unit at 320 Clementi avenue 4. On 07/06/2022 at around 1221h7s while I was at home., eddy replied to my WhatsApp message that sent him on 06/06/2022 with enquiries to rent the above-mentioned property. Eddy then explain to me what the procedure and the payment arrangement was. Eddy then asked me for my ic photo which I gave. Subsequently eddy asked me to make a 2-month deposit with 1 month of security amounting to sgd$5100/-. I did as was told and on 07/06/2022 at 1850hrs while I was at home, I transferred sgd$5100/- from my DBS’savings to Chua T te Ping uob7693920??? through i-banking. After the payment eddy sent me an email with the tenancy agreement, but the location was wrong. Eddie then sent me another agreement with the correct address. Eddy then explained to me i had to make another payment for stamp duty amounting to sgd$1632.00/-. I felt suspicious and did not make the payment. On 15/06/2022, I then checked with my cousin who was a property agent. She informed me that it might be a scam and gave eddy contact number which was different than the contact number that I contacted with. The real Eddy then informed me that he never dealt with me before and he had multiple messages from other people with similar incident. Editor's Note: In order to verify if the real estate agent is who they claimed to be, check the agent's contact number against this online Register by CEA: https://www.cea.gov.sg/aceas/public-register/sales/1. The contact number should match the one registered with CEA. If it isn't, please do not deal with the agent. Always pay the rent directly to the landlord.
Received an automated female voice recording in Chinese claiming my Singpass account will be deactivated if I don't response. The call id number wasn't prefix with +65. The scammers either using local number or had found a workaround on the +65 prefix.
The scam call I received did not have a "+65" in front so I took the call. The caller had a Malaysian accent and pretended to be an acquaintance of mine. He claimed to have lost his phone and wallet and that this is his new number. The next day, he called to ask for a loan to which I refused. he immediately hung up.
Phone call on a local number without "+65". Upon picking up his call, he immediately claimed that he changed his number. Then when I responded "huh, who are you", he said "So familiar already, forgot my name?". I exposed him and he hung up the call. He didnt take my call when I called back.He had a Malaysian accent. Beware!

Here is their number +923340517132 Just want to share a story to raise awareness, especially for those that are not tech savvy.
Have received more than 3 robocalls supposedly from MOH saying that something wrong with my vaccination status. When I pressed 1 for english, it went to Chinese speaking "officer" and when I told them to stop scamming people, he sounded genuine, like he's from MOH and why I'm accusing him of lying! The strange thing is that he asked why I called him!
I received two missed call from this number 8854 5964. it's a local number and no + in it. so when I saw the number I thought it is from delivery guy or someone that I know cos it's local number. I called back and ask who called my number, there is this guy's voice (mandarin, Malaysian accent) appear and ask me, "hey, you don't remember my voice ah?" I heard it and mistaken it with one of my colleague, so I say, is this XXX? he said "yes, it's me, just want to update you that i changed my number, so you need to delete the old number (my colleague's original number) and use this number (scammer's number) instead." I believed and say okay okay. I ask why his voice sounds different and he said it's because he got bad cold. I ask why he changed the number he say he lost his phone and wallet in the hawker center and look at the CCTV can not find who stolen it. until there I believed in what he said he was. until he start to ask me, "are you free next Saturday?" I said, why? he said "oh, I got open a new company with my friend and we going to have buffet, so just wonder if you free to join." from here i start to have question mark cos it just sounds something is not right. I was thinking to call my colleague's number to verify with him again. so I being more cautious and say, i will let you know again. he insist that if next Saturday i'm not free he can meet me on next Tuesday, I said I'm not sure. then he insist ask me to delete the "old" number and save his "new" number. I hang up. After that, I called my colleague and ask if he got call me just now, the answer is nope he didn't' call me at all. I don't know what's the scammer's intension and it is really creepy that he pretending someone else and using a local phone number that ppl will fall for it easily. so be aware even if the number is local number, always double check with your friends that if they got call you or not.
Got to know this guy from Instagram by the name of 'Hakim Hassan' recently on 25 may 2022. He is from Indonesia but grow up, live and work in Manchester, uk. (for 25 years) he has 3 Instagram accounts apparently and 1 not privatized.He declared his love to me in 3 days saying it was love at first sight.Then he asked for my info like full name, address &amp; hp number which I was reluctant to give initially because he wanted to send me gifts to prove his love but he did not mention about me having to pay any fees or info. I gave my info after some arguments with him. Next he asked for my shoe size and showed me a video of the gifts that he was sending. After sending them then he told me that I have to pay certain cleaners courier fee for about 1k plus. The parcel arrived the next day and I received a text from the courier called Airtrust service courier (ACS) telling me to pay $1350 for parcel clearance but I ignored and didnt answered their call at all. I immediately google to check, i read someone was scammed for the similar case too.No money lost so far.
I am foreigner in Singapore and the call impersonating SG court sounded really genuine to me. The person was able to address my name and asking for my passport # which i had given unfortunately. and I was started to panic and at that point, i was transferred to a 'police officer" and to lodge and report the following : outstanding due 9,628.90 SGD at ICBC VISA PLATINUM CREDIT date of Application - 1st of March 2022 BANK Branch - ICBC China town Billing address 997 Bukit Timah Road Unit No. 09-04 Postal 589 633 when I got transferred to a "fake policeman" - i realized that it is a scam call so then i drop immediately. PLEASE BE CAREFUL , its sounded like a very genuine call specially for a foreign visitors.
I have been received lots of spam calls over the past while, and this time round the caller called me via his mobile number 82693610 to promote a personal loan scam. I answered the call and once he started selling his easy loan services, I ended the call as I knew it was against the regulations for licensed moneylenders to advertise their services. I then submitted his number to a few online phone reverse lookup databases to warn others against this number 82693610, and now i am submitting this scam alert notice to inform the authorities about it.
The person (with a strong Malaysian Chinese accent) would know your name (likely from the name you put in Whatsapp) and claimed to be your friend. when you ask who is this, the caller would ask you to guess and he would agree to whatever name that you said. He would say the number showing on your caller ID is his new handphone number and convinced you to save it. After establishing this trust, the next time he calls, you would think that you are speaking the real friend since you have already saved the new number a few days ago. The scheme is to scam victims after several calls. Please beware of such scams and always verify the caller's identity by calling mutual friends or get in touch with the person via other communication channels before saving the new number.
Call from High Court, asking to attend court hearing informed that I needed to attend court hearing. The hearing is that I had used a company to do illegal online betting. I denied to have such company and he wanted to provide me another number to call for CAD, which I highly suspected that it's a scam. I said I will find the official CAD hotline online to clarify, and he put down the phone immediately.
The call came to my daughter from ICBC China Bank, from their Chinatown branch. The person was able to address my daughter by her name and informed her that her I/C was used to issue a credit card which was sent to an address in Bukit Timah. There was a payment of almost $10,000 due tomorrow. She started to panic and at that point, she was transferred to a 'police officer'. At that point, she came to me and gave me the phone and i spoke to that 'officer'. Initially, there were no red flags and the policeman I spoke to spoke English with a Singaporean accent and sounded genuine. He asked me to come down to the cantonment branch to make a report and when i asked if i can make a report in my neighbourhood police post, he agreed. After the call, when i spoke to my daughter, i realised it was a +65 number and so could be a spam call. I called the bank and asked them to check if a credit card was issued since we had the card number and they said no. I also called the spoofed number and the person who picked up said he was not from the bank. Please be careful as this seems to be a new type of scam and the people speaking don't speak with obvious accents, so it sounded like a very genuine call.
I was chatting with stranger who goes by the name of "Zhang Ivan". He said that he was Singaporean, his job was a doctor and he was single father for 2 teenagers. Days later, he told me that he got a mission from UN and would be working in Jordan, a few days after arriving in Jordan, he got prizes, and a certificate with a MILLION USD cash in a box from his "General". His "General" told him not to keep this huge and advised him to send it to his own family. But "Dr Zhang" told me if he doesn't have any family or relationships but only 2 teenage daughters, so he begged to help him to receive this box with the cash. He forced me to made several payments from logistics, his isolation room fees, flight tickets, etc. I sent him around $60,000, and to different bank accounts over a period of time. Now, I am completely broke. Would like to share this encounter with the Netizens here to prevent them from getting scammed.
I was contacted on telegram with a job offer (28/12/21). Soon after, I was contacted on WhatsApp and provided with a website detailing the company and a job portal. Two accounts were created, the first being one for my own use, the second by the person whom I was speaking to. After topping-up the second account, they directed me to complete the tasks to generate data. By example, there was a need to top up the account every time it reached a negative amount. She would top up the account by direct me to contact customer service with the top-up details. Upon completing the tasks, she withdrew the amount from the account and sent the amount to the first account that had been made for my own use. I was then directed to complete the tasks on the account where I proceeded to do the same and successfully withdrew a portion of the money. (28/12/21). The next day (29/12/21), the same person contacted me. Following the same steps, I completed the steps on her account first. Things started getting worse when I started using my own account. The amounts kept getting bigger and when I consulted the person about these amounts, she continued to encourage me to keep going so that I could withdraw the full amount once the tasks were complete. I contacted customer service and questioned them, stating that if I did not get the money back, I would lodge a police report. They replied that they had an army of lawyers that would counter the claims. After some back and forth, I was told that a manager would be calling me. During the call, their manager requested we top up a final amount to off-set the negative on the account so that the order could be completed. Including the amount that was supposed to be deposited, I was supposed to receive the total plus commission once the transfer was complete. I agreed to this after requesting some details as assurance from the manager. Once I had fulfilled the top-up, I waited before going to check the status of the account. This was when the manager called me again, yelling at me to ask me what I did, only to find that there was now a new order on the account and that the negative amount on the account was back even larger than the last. They claimed that this had never happened before and said that I had done something. I did not even have my phone with me because I had it on the charger at the time the transaction was made. I noticed a HP advertisement on their website earlier which is why I thought the company had some legitimacy to it. A friend that I consulted went to do some research and found that the company was using an expired marketing quote without consent. She has said that HP will now be reporting the company because the comment expired 4 years ago.

I then informed him that this is fraud. He told me he would submit my request to his department to make a Police report at the Commercial Affair Department. He then told me that he was going to transfer me internally to their CAD emergency line and advise me to wait for the transfer call to be linked, I agreed. During line transfer, I hung up the call. straight away "CAD" called me back (62354037 &amp; 62353360). I refused to pick up the call. I immediately called Maybank hotline (1800-629 2265) and shared with the customer service all of the above via the "fraud reporting options".

I was selling my cod mobile account as I was getting bored of the game,and my dad strongly advised me to take back the money I spent via Carousell. Anyways, the scammer approached me under the status of an interested customer when he requested letting him take a brief look in the account,i agreed, however, he said he had trouble logging in due to a "2-step verification" feature, and that I send him the OTP. Thinking nothing of it at the time, I sent it to him, and before long, i had received a notification stating that my email and password had been changed to another one. I was extremely shocked, and went back to the app to confront the scammer. However, he simply laughed and belittled me,before blocking me. I have attempted to make actions by contacting the help centre of the platform my account was in, as well as Carousell. A friend of mine also attempted to threaten him into returning account, but the scammer was suspended before he could make actions. Now, I have no way to reach him. 2.it happened just today, 1st june 3.about $1500,put in the account, was lost
Usual lucrative job offer of SGD$500 / week. 'Brandon' asked me to register through a link (In which I did not click) Asked for his company information and he gave a legitimate registered company. However, upon checking, there is no such job and such person. His texts have so many typing errors that he is already so suspicious from the start. Please remember that real recruiter does not recruit through personal text msgs.
Scam call using the local contact number 68333000 and claimed to be calling from 'MOH'. The caller hung up immediately when I questioned him further. Be careful of such impersonation phone calls!
I was contacted on Telegram by a lady named "Janice Teow" who offered me a food review job where I could work anywhere. Followed by a reference to another lady name Diana Fong through another Telegram message, explaining how the job works. The company posted as working under crew marketing company &amp; provided me with a constant changing website address. They claimed that this is done to protect the privacy of users, so the website address will keep changing. In order to do the job, you have to invest a small amount at first, $115, to start. The job is to rate food reviews &amp; a total of 33 evaluations. After 1st round, it was easy &amp; the merchant paid a commission to me of $11. They claimed that you can play a maximum of 4 rounds daily; every time you start a new round, you have to deposit $115 into a bank account number that the company will give you through their so-called "customer service" WhatsApp account. Every time the bank account number provided is different, as I go along with round 2, the amount started to get bigger &amp; bigger for you to deposit to continue. That's when I realised is a scam. I had deposited $20k &amp; last final question, they asked for another $20k. This is where I stopped it &amp; knew that I am now a scam victim. To get back your money, you have to continue to complete the given 33-36 food evaluation. The lady Diana even offered to pay me $5k to help me continue, which I rejected as the police alert stated if you want to get back your money &amp; receive the deposit from another person into your bank account. You are also becoming part of their money mule. So please be careful &amp; not to be part of these scammers' money mules just to get back your money.
I received a call from +6594267499 and was a automated voice recording claiming to be from the High Court and there was a case for me and should press "2" for more details. I pressed 2 and after some ringing a male answered saying this is High Court "how can I help you?". When i explained to him, he asked my full name and IC details and then he said he would check. He then said that there is an overdue credit card payment of 7428 SGD from ICBC bank (Chinatown Branch) . When I explained that i don't have such card and that somebody else did the application. he told me he will divert the call to police station for me to report and check if there is other criminal activity with my name used. The call was transferred and a male replied and after 10 minutes call, he told me to download LINE app and share my IC copy for verification. I realised that this is a scam and asked him to stop the call and that i will go to the nearest police station for a face to face complaint. He tried to convince me to continue but I refused &amp; we finished the call. I almost fell for this. What a waste of time.
Watch out for phishing emails pretending to be from “Singpost”. Scammers will email a sort of official looking email that looks like from Singpost. Email claims that you have this package that is still pending, and you will need to transfer money to them in the amount of $2.99. The link will bring you to a website that is not the official Singpost website. But it will still look official. If you are a techie, you can see the website address and email address are not the official Singpost email. Do not put your credit card info on the website they provided.

The person would tell you Your Name, and after which he will proceed to start a story on how he changed his phone number recently. He would also mention thAt he is your father’s friend and proceed to say that he will whatsapp you (because i don’t recognise his voice at all and he must have realised that he failed).
Scammer used my CEA license, my name, my photo, fake email and fake hp number to scam people through rental scam. he will ask for a deposit in order to view a property and i know of 3 victims that fell prey to this scam. please verify the phone number used with cea public register. a property agent live and die by their handphone number so if the hp number does not return the agent's id, it is a scam. If you are a victim, please report to the Police.
On the 18th of May, I received a telegram text from someone named bee lim about a job on food review, in which you can earn a commission of $30 to $300. Of course I knew this was a scam as I have read the stories shared by people on scam alert. I decided to humor the scammer and then she transferred me to another person called jenny. Obviously another scammer as she mistakenly said her name was karen, deleted the text and corrected her mistake. She then sent me a link for the "platform" to do the food review job mentioned. It was the usual "do a few reviews, after 30-33 reviews, you can cash out". The caveat being you need to deposit money to continue after the initial few reviews. After the whole fiasco, she added me to a telegram group called enjoy life with another "newbie". The newbie contacted me saying she was scared this was a scam and said she would ask someone to check whether it was a legitimate job. OF course the next day she said that after checking, it was legitimate without showing any evidence. This goes to show how far some people would go just to scam others of their own livelihood. I urge anyone who has received these types of job offers to verify with the relevant parties on whether this is a scam or not. No recruiters would solicit you unprofessionally using telegram/WhatsApp. I hope everyone continues to be safe and avoid scams such as this and inform your friends and family. Please be alert.
Normally we know any phone call with +65 will be a scam call but this phone call is 63259222 without +65. I think the scammer already upgrade to new way to make a scam call. From the calling, the scammer seems local person and know local government organization well.

Got a call from someone who was supposedly from Lazada. she said that there might have been an unauthorised overseas transaction on my account for the purchase of a macbook costing $1,200 made by a third party. The Story was quite convincing because not only does this person know my name and phone number, she knows my email address too. (I asked for her to prove that she was really from lazada.) What didn't make sense to me was that it was not my bank that called me to verify the transaction. I mean, if someone used my Lazada account and paid for the item him/herself, well... go ahead. no loss to me. i'd just need to update my password or something, and yes, of course worry about this person having access to my Home address as well. I checked my app to see if there was any recent new order made, but there was nothing. On hindsight, I've had problems transacting on Lazada when I'm on VPN, so the app is advanced enough to detect if there is any strange traffic (and not let the transaction go through). the lady on the other line asked me for the 6-digit OTP, which of course was a surefire sign that it was a scam call. It really helped that Lazada included the following message in their text: Lazada: NEVER SHARE YOUR OTP. LAZADA will not request OTP from customers. That, and a quick google search, really helped me confirm that this call is not legitimate at all. I put down the phone, and the lady didn't try to call me back. Perhaps they also know that if the intended victim chose to terminate their call, there's no use pursuing. Lady had an indian accent (might be a call centre in india?) and called from a +65 number. Unfortunately I've hade too many of such calls and I can't identify which one was it that this call came through.
Given the current supply-demand in home rentals, it is very hard to even get a viewing appointment, seems to be a norm for tenants to pay a deposit to secure a unit right away. After having lost quite a few units without even having a chance to view it first, i decided to trust this guy. I found this ad on ohmyhome website, which gave a whatsapp number to contact (there were two links with the samd ad) https://omh.sg/listing/true-punggol-walk/2167408 https://omh.sg/listing/true-punggol-walk/2167408 This guy asked me to pay one month deposit and rent , which i did. he passed me the a/c details etc the ads are in multiple names: Aleena Hany, Shinta dw and the landlord name given is goh wee hong, thomas. He also collected my id proof to prepare the contract and gave me an appt, but he never showed up there. Most importantly, he is still online (although he has blocked my number), and the ad is still up, in spite of me having reported to the OMH. So beware .. Please be careful. Editor's note: Please note that scammers will impersonate a legitimate housing agent by using their details. In order to verify if you are speaking to a real agent, please search by the agent's advertised phone number here: https://www.cea.gov.sg/aceas/public-register/sales/1. There is no need to pay to secure a viewing.
I have been receiving many impersonation phone calls. The calls started off with robocalls and attempted to impersonate various Ministries. For one, an "automated call" from High court of Singapore saying its my final chance to clear my summons and i need to press a number to talk to a officer. Phone number used: +6562564158 One more kind that is quite regular is from "ministry of health", saying my citizenship will be revoked (i am a permanent resident) if i dont press 9 to talk to an agent. phone number used:+6589496489 Look out for calls with the + prefix and if possible, don't pick them up.
Today morning AROUND 11:35 AM, I RECEIVED A WHATSAPP VIDEO CALL FROM +1 (347) 980-9833. the caller claimed to be from the "Singapore Police Force". The caller was wearing a mask and simply dressed in a white t-shirt and blazer. at first he showed his id card which was mentioned as Singapore police. He started a conversation saying that my debit card has been declined as i did not update my visa particulars with the bank. he insisted me to show my visa (i don't remember what exactly he mentioned. i thought he was asking for my singapore visit pass) by switching on the back camera. i showed my visit pass (both front and back side) which i recently received. he asked me to show the atm card. I said, why do you need my atm card? He replied that these details are not updated with my bank and he mentioned about my bank name and debit card number (i am guessing a fake). However, i have not attempted to check. then he mentioned that the bank has given a complaint to police and the caller is investigating it. he said if i don't show the card he cannot ingest my details and my account will be seized for 6 months and i may not able to withdraw. moreover, he mentioned that i will be jailed if i don't do it now. I told him to send an email. how can i trust you? he said, see my id, i am making a video call. Then i replied that i will not share my details. i will visit my bank right now and give all the details they ask. then he replied that if you don't do it now, you will be jailed. then i told him to call after 10 mins so that I will quickly check with a customer care. he was reluctant to listen me and repeatedly mentioning me to trust him and do it asap or i will cut the call and i will come and catch you. i was bit of tensed, shocked (as i am new to singapore) but hesitated to share my bank details. the caller was not giving me time to think. i told him to give me 2 mins i will check with my seniors. Luckily all these incidents happened in my office and i took the phone to my ro. after mentioning about these details, she immediately told me to cut the call and said that it is a scam. She share that were already these incidents being reported even in the newspapers and so don't believe them. i thought reporting such an incident will alert others not to fall in to such prey.
I received a call from a scammer with strong Malaysian accent on 17 May 8:12pm pretending to be someone I know. the caller claimed that his handphone and wallet got stolen by the workers renovating his house and this was his new number. His mobile number is 8896 0923. i asked him who he was and he said he was someone that talked to me often, how could i forget. instead i blurted out my colleague's name which he said he was. Next day, still thinking he was my colleague he called for help to transfer money to his contractor because he has fired them for the stolen incident but he needed to pay them for the works already done and his bank account is not activated yet. he mentioned he would pay me back the next day once his account is activated. Thinking he needed it urgently, I transferred 3600 to his contractor. then he requested for another 6000 because his friend mistakenly transferred to his account instead of the contractor. but i only decided to transfer 1400, saying my limit was 5000. he kept asking me to check if my limit could be changed. So, I said i was out for lunch and will do so when i'm back in office. back in office, i suddenly thought to message my colleague on microsoft teams, and asked him about it. he said he did not call me at all, and then I realized it was all a scam! Should have checked with my colleague before doing any transfers! i hope police can nab this scammer!
On 12May 2022. I came across an online job recruitment in telegram group. I was keen thus decided to respond to it. The recruiter claimed that that it was a freelance job and I could earn 350/ week and also earn commission daily, She explains that is to create DTA on the platform. I was skeptical at first but she assures me that the company is genius by showing proof of the registered company and address in singapore. Afterwards, i was added to a whatsapp group where there was several people inside too. I was inform to register my account at https://www.ef-visenze.com/n. I registered my bank account in the link so as they can pay me. so i started to do the data creation where there is 40 sets of data to do. they claim that every 40 sets there will be 0-4 (special data) so i have to pay for it where the special data I can earn 5x more commission. First set was just double digit where I have to pay. Afterwards the second set of 40 , it increases to triple digit, but I still manage to get back my earnings and capital inclusive. It is where the third set where it started and price got more and more ranging from $800-28000!. They claimed that if I do not pay, I will not be able to get my capital back and they will take legal action against me. I then started to realize something is amiss. Pls everyone do not fall to such scams!! Im just a student my life savings of $X0000 was just lost like that in a few hours. It is for my university fees, really hope anti scam center and the police will be able to arrest the scammers and our money returned back to use. Editor's note: Scammers will pay victims the promised commission in the first few instances to get the victims' trust. However, please note that this is a trap to get victims to pay more in order to cash out more. So, please beware of unsolicited job offers especially one that's sent to you via messaging platforms or social media. Always call the hiring company directly to verify the job offer.
Found a so call collage girl doing part time "service". Saying 300 for 2 hours. Insist I go fetch her from her place. Told me to wait at 7-eleven, theb says her friend will call to discuss. Her friend called, asking if this is the first time ordering escort, keep saying becoz she is a student and all the sob stories. To avoid police, he told me to spend 300 on razor gold and snap a photo to the girl. The guy on phone insist me not to hang up thr call. He asked about my appearance and saying she is on her way to meet me. Then he tells another sob story about sex abuse and needs protection fee which is another 2000 razor which i dont have. The moment i told him that he said to give me a link to transfer 2000 razer gold to that account. This is where i begin to suspect something is not right. Then i stopped. He then sends some images and some video of a poor guy being beaten up and treaten to hurt my family by looking up my phone number. I remove all the stuff he sent and all the apps and everything related. I removed the sim card and clear all traces. Here's what he doesn't know. The number was fake. The iD details to purchase the sim card is also fake. The details i gave the lady was also fake. The only thing solid that was given are the few digits from razor gold. Which he has probably claimed for about 300. To everyone that wants to order any "services", never show your real photos. Never use your real phone number, never use your original instant messanger app, never give any real details. Always wear face mask in case he is nearby. (Suspect he isn't near my becoz he told me to snap a photo of 7-11 shop)
A headhunter from BGC job agency messaged me via telegram about this job. Later on a guy whatsapp me saying he is an agent working for Visenze. He told me I need to complete 40 data set to earn commission. During the process, system will prompt me to paynow a certain amount to an individual. He assured me that this only happen from 0 to 4 times within the 40 data set and this "deposit" and the commission will be returned to me after completion. I managed to complete 1 set and gotten back my money. However, during my second set, the deposit amount grew larger. I transferred 13k plus to 2 individuals. Hopefully I can get back all my money. Never did I realise that the last few clicks, the system requested for another 29k, I felt something is not right. That was the time I stopped the process and immediately filed police report. A few days later, the so call custom service whatsapp me to complete the data set and also demanded me to complete 40 data set every 2 hours.
100% of all online loan offers are either illegal, scams or loan sharks. I met my scammer on locanto sg. instead of asking victims for upfront fees, they have reversed tactics now. insisted to deposit a small sum of $100 to $500 into My bank account to "test My capabilities if I qualify for the loan". To be return in 1 week + 50% interests (Neg). If i can't pay the full amount, just pay interests. I refused to accept but caller + boss continued to pressure me and did not want to hang up the Whatsapp call. I cut it off eventually.
I received an sms from sg-mail (Singapore_police_force_anti-scam_centre@spf.gov.sg) that I could have encountered a job scam of transferring money to a bank account in return for job commissions. this is my encounter on 14 may 2022. An unknown person contacted me via telegram, saying that they have my number on their records (some job agency person; her account on telegram has been deleted). She then referred another person to contact me (her telegram: eve k). She gave me the job description, which is to give good reviews to several F&amp;B places. I have to complete first initial 32 reviews to be able to withdraw my 1st commission (which is $11.38). I managed to complete, and the commission was transferred to me by Paynow (since they have my number already). i did not review my bank account number. Afterwards, she told me to join a group in telegram which has other users and the owner of the company. They mentioned that there were some bonuses to be won, and user will have to deposit a minimum of $110. some other users also sent their screenshots of how much money they have in their commission account. Back to eve k, she explained that the next reviews + commission can only proceed if I deposit a minimum of $110 as well. i gave excuses that I have no money etc, and initiated to return the commission of $11.38 as I can't participate anymore. she said I don't have to return, then, I left the telegram group. so far no one there contacted me except eve k, even though we have already ended the conversation the day prior. Additional info: website given by the person (eve k) always has access denied error, she would then give me different urls, and chrome/opera browser would say there is a security alert. 1st website: www.statistic-sgmktsltd.com 2nd website: WWW.SG-EVENTSTATISTICSLTD.COM 3rd website: www.event-sgstatisticsltd.com
I received a scam call from Lazada 'customer service rep' Saying someone made a transaction this morning to purchase a canon camera. He was Asking me if I was the one who made the purchase. If i did not, he will stop the transaction. But, I needed to tell them my OTP sent via phone sms as well as via email. I tried to stall for time and asked for the person's identity several time. He told me his name confidently 'Mike Haysen'. However, caller had an Indian accent. He pressed on to ask for the OTP. He mentioned that if I didn't provide him the OTP now, he will let the transaction proceed. He further commented that I would not be able to call them back to ask for refund.
I received a call from a guy who claimed to be Alan from Lazada (already suspicious at this point as i have not made any Lazada purchases or even opened Lazada recently) and that he wanted to verify a purchase from apple. At this point, I said "no" and immediately ended the call so he only got my first name and confirmation of my number. I still went ahead to block all of my cards to be safe. Contacted Lazada's helpdesk and the agent confirmed they would never ask to verify over a phone call and will feedback to management.
Scam Message received: Shopee invites you to experience online earn commissions WFH, Daily Earnings $260 no time limit, free for work Kindly PM Whatsapp: wa.me/60104395875
I got scammed. It is about a job where you do reviews for different cuisines, and for every 28-31 cuisines you reviewed, you will get a commission of $16. However, after the 28-31 times, you have to top-up, I think, $112 to continue. After that, I would get a 'special delicacy ' that would require me to top-up hundreds or thousands, and I would get 5 times the commission . I'm on my 27th review, and i'm not sure if there's one more or 6 more . I was first contacted on telegram then referred to someone on whatsapp . The group consists of 14 people. In my case one of the new mwmbers reached out to me and she got her money back . But when i tried to, the money i had to deposit was not only once but was getting bigger and bigger . My next transfer is supposed to be around 2000, and i am unsure if i should do it to get my money back .
I was contacted by a recruiter from "BGC Group" called Julie and she referred me to the job in-Charge known as ChongLin. Chonglin then introduced to me that the job was to boost sellers' listings just by clicking 2 buttons. The job involves completing 45 sets of lisitings and I will receive commission for each listing I have completed. The listings are categorized into 2 types: normal and enterprise. Normal does not require deposits while Enterprise requires deposits. At first, when an enterprise data pops up, chonglin will lead by asking me to contact the customer service whatsapp account to request for a bank account to deposit money. He also explained that I could take out my principal on top of my commissions. Afterwards, he even showed a screenshot of his transaction to gain my trust. The next day when I tried, there were much more enterprise lisitings. Each listings requires more and more money to deposit in order to complete the lisiting. Being led on by chonglin, i did not doubt much and continued to deposit until I realise I do not have sufficient funds to do so. Thats when I asked from help and they asked me to borrow from my friends and family. Its was only when I told my sister and I found out it was a scam. I lost about 11k at this point. I reported to the bank and police later on in the same day. Here are some of the key takeaways from my incident: 1) Do not trust any online messages claiming to be a recruiter 2) There should always be company funds to perform business operations. So even if the party seems reliable and convincing, do not trust him/her to make deposits 3) Just because there is a group chat for your work, means your job us real. Though not mention above, I was being added to a whatsapp group chat. I believed their tactics to make you think it is legitimate. They also purposefully gain your trust by having other scammers acting as newbies to ask questions you would be interested in to gain your trust. 4) It is obvious that it is a scammer organization, with one loop after another to get you trapped in this scam. 5) Always question everything you see online, no matter how reliable it may seem. 6) When you find it suspicious, always trust ur instinct, stop what you are doing and verify. Do not be led on by the scammers. I hope my painful lesson will help to spread awareness and prevent less people from falling prey to such scams again. :)
Saw an advertisement in Locanto and response to it on 8th May. Finally agree to pay for her service after she confirmed that she accept cash payment on 14th May 2022. Upon reaching Yew Tee MRT station, she message say her friend will call me to check that I'm not police or bad person. Her so called-friend called and told me to use the AXS Machine to buy Razer Gold putting email address as "gggi018@163.com" as she'll not accept cash because afraid of "police fishing". I refused to pay and they started to called/message/send threatening messages/voice messages/videos using different numbers (+60147240578/+60142971268/+60178152103). Today received messages/voice messages and videos from another phone number. Obviously, these are scammers posing themselves as "gang members" so that people will be frightened and give in. In the past, real "gang member" will not identify themselves nor will they betray their "gang" code of conduct. Even if there is till "gang member" in Singapore, they'll lie low and not proudly identify themselves to create troubles. Beware of those posting in locanto with +60 phone number with Line ID.
I accidentally clicked on a call that I didn't know. I thought it was from MOH or ICA as I was applying for something. However they said that I had a parcel from China with drugs regarding covid-19.

Scammer with a strong Malaysian accent called me on 13 May, 8.41pm, trying to impersonate to be someone I know. The caller claimed that he had changed his number and told me this was his new number. His mobile number is 94468532. The scary thing is he knows my full name and when i repeatedly asked him who he was, he kept asking me to guess and said he was someone whom I hung out often. After awhile of not answering my question on his identity, he hung up the phone.

After transferring $108, I started the renew, halfway through the review say I received a special delicacies, I checked with CS and the reply was you so lucky, you will enjoy 5 times commission if you deposit the amount stated, human greed so I deposited $xxx and i continue the review and it stop again, this time round the amount became $xxxx, now in order to get back my $xxx i procced to deposit $xxxx. each set is 32 review so towards the end at 31 it stop and say special delicacies, this time is $xxxxx amount. i told the cs no way i going ahead and they keep convincing me to proceed one more review i would be able to withdraw the comm and deposited money all at one time. this time i knew i am scammed.

While watching a show online, a pop-up informing me that my computer had been locked. Message informed me to call a Microsoft number shown on screen. So I called, and the person on the other line had a thick Indian accent answered. My call was subsequently transferred to a Filipino woman, who introduced herself as “Sandra? She asked for my personal and confidential information which I gave. Subsequently, I checked my DBS account later and realised about $4,000 was gone.
Chinese man called to say he is from MOH and asked me for my name. And alleged that my phone number has been used to send false news about covid 19 to multiple numbers and questioned me about my actions in an authoritative manner. The guy has a strong Chinese accent. Immediately knew it was a scam call.
I received a missed voicecall from this number on whatsapp they use our SPF profile pic. I have seen a similar type of scam posted online by others as a warning. Hence, I immediately knew it's for sure a scam and lucky i didn't pick up the videocall. I have blocked the number on my phone. Please be wary of such suspicious numbers
Lost $5k++ for a scam job I met a female from Facebook and we add each other on Whatsapp. We started off with chatting at the beginning and she started told me to help her to complete some "tasks". At the beginning, the tasks amount is below $1k. Then, I was told to transfer a very big amount to complete all my tasks, or else I couldn’t get back the money that I transferred before. So, this time, I transferred $5k+ and complete it but it still need to transfer about $16k+ to fulfil it only can get back all the money. This time, I realised it was all a scam and $5k+ gone!
Met a girl through Facebook dating. Arranged for a meet-up one day, she said she needed boss/manager to contact me first before being able to meet with her. Boss asked to pay $200 in razer gold credits through axs to specific email address 'hvvv001@163.com'. After that he will tell you some sob story about how others abuse the host and get your empathy. He will ask for your ic front and back so he can register for visitor to condo. (and no, condo's don't do this.) And after that he will tell you to transfer 200 again to the same email saying host will return after the deed for the host protection in case anything happen to her. Just change last 3 digits 2 times each. E.g. Hvvv002, 003, 004 and so on. And after you tell him you have no money to pay anymore. He will start to get aggressive and send you videos of people getting wrecked and house getting smashed as example, he will also threaten to use your ic to apply with loan sharks. If you don't pay, he will start to threaten to drag your family into this whole mess. He will tell you to do for 6 emails x2 first. After that he will say if you are not involved with police need pay hush fee as insurance. So another set of 6 emails x2. All in all they will try to threaten you into paying more when it doesn't make sense. I panicked and kept sending till my savings are wiped. That was the point i decided to ask for 1 hour and then ask for perspective from other. Police report was made immediately after that. $5,000 lost in total. So to all who think about dating on Facebook or anywhere. Asking for credit first before the deed is a red flag. Don't bother to give ic/money before. And the 'threats' will start. So please look out for the symptoms above and take care all.
Matched with this guy called James on OkCupid. telegram id is joylim1, skype name is James mark. He started by saying that he is currently in the states and is planning to relocate to sg for work as an engineer in a few weeks time. he also said that he is going offshore for work in the states and asked me to help him speak with his landlady-to-be in sg, Mrs chen (telegram id is mrschenshalihah). the landlady-to-be then asked me to pay $2500 as a deposit to help James secure the apartment. managed to lower the deposit to $500 and somehow she refunded the money back to me as she was unable to locate her husband. James then asked me to buy $500 worth of itunes card for him so that he can buy application on itunes for his supposed new apartment in sg. realised it is a scam when he is unable to share what is he up to, that he cant video call when is able to voice call. he then asked me to send another $500 worth of bitcoin to his landlady for the apartment, but subsequently i blocked off all contact with him and the landlady.

The costs of products will get higher as you need to deposit higher amounts. At some point, I just don't feel good about it. And immediately report it to the police. They seem legit. Have arca registered. Uen number etc. Once you deposit.. You can never see your money again.

Someone named Karen (profile photo looks Chinese race, young pretty girl), messaged me on Telegram asking if I wanted a job, which can be part time, and to reply “yes” if interested. I replied "no" but she replied immediately, almost like it was automated, asking that I should read the job details first, give her two mins etc.... I said I have a job already. she replied, again very quickly saying essentially the same thing but phrased differently. I was thinking, she asked me if I’m interested and asked me to read the job details first, like three times, but she never sent me any details. I guess she was waiting for me to say “yes.” And so I decided to have fun and said I’m only interested in selling bubble tea. And she proceeded to curse me and called me names, and sent my Telegram profile photo to me which creeped me out. I replied saying wow, so polite you, I’m sure you get many recruits. Again she called me names, and proceeded to block me, after which the whole thread was gone. I regret not screenshotting. Oh, she also sprinkled a few of those smiling emojis with hearts on it..that was before she turned all psycho.
Today I got a call from, +12048086837 on WhatsApp. When I answered the call, the person was impersonating as mom staff and he said, I've not verified my identity card. I disconnected immediately after this sentence. After that, I reported and blocked the number on WhatsApp.

So I saw on social media that there is this bridging loan from government, I was thinking, might be good to have some money to tie through. I clicked and they directed me to a guy call “Andy”. They said I needed to do video call with my NRIC to proceed with loan. So I did video-call him and send them my nric. I was told there is a process fees and I transferred them. Then thereafter, I realised the co name was not the same as what they claimed to be in the first place. Feeling suspicious about the whole thing, I told them that I wanted to cancel the loan request. Ended up they ask me to make a cancellation fee of 3k plus and I did becos they threatened to harm my family if I did not.. Then they became more aggressive. They wanted to -burn down my house and harm my family if i did not transfer them another sum of money. I report to the police all this …and till now they still kept calling me.Editor's Note: Licensed moneylenders cannot advertise their services online, including social media, via messaging apps, SMSes or cold calls.

I received a call from a man who claimed he was from MOH, and he knew my name, he spoke to me in Mandarin, with China slang, I already started feel not right, normally from government supposed to be in English. Then I asked what is the issue, he said they are going to terminate my tracker later today, I guess he is refer to trace together, which actually made him looks more suspicious, as local always called it as trace together, not tracker. I asked him why, he said I bring in some medicine from other country but didn't declare it to MOH, I already confirmed he is scam, I never leave country for many years or bought any medicine from illegal source, so I directly hang up on him. But I think my personal data is exposed as he knows my name, which is dangerous.Editor's Note: Scammers can harvest personal data from variety of sources, including the websites that you sign up to, lucky draws that you joined, data leaks, etc. In order not to get fooled, treat all unsolicited phone calls with skepticism even though the caller is able to quote your personal details.

Received a call from a phone number with a +65 which are obviously using phone number masking. Caller was able to identify my last name, introduced himself as a personal from Singapore Ministry of Health and mention that they have receive public complain that a phone number that were registered under me has been violating moh’s safe management measures. Above conversation was made via mandarin and caller has this Taiwanese’s ascent. My respond to him were: 1) why is our conversation in Mandarin? Is this MOH’s protocol to converse and introduce yourself in Mandarin? 2) Since when MOH hire Taiwanese as call operator? 3) I replied how come that phone number that receive complain, i’m not aware that i have this additional number under my name? He sound very pissed, so in the end our phone call became arguing session. Before he ended the call, he still threatened to blacklist my number and submit to singapore police force. Ultimate joke of the day. By the way, some red flags observed from this experience: 1) masked number which called id shown “+65” before a singapore handphone number 2) throughout the conversation are in mandarin 3) totally unprofessional at all. Threatening / easily agitated.Just want to warn others of this scam.
Caller claimed to be from HSBSC and that I had a transaction done for $145k which was transferred out to an OCBC account. When I sounded to panic and asked to speak to a manager, a david loy came on the phone and insisted that 2 transactions were made and one is currently on hold. When i told him, there is only 1 problem.. I do not have a HSBSC current account. He paused and insisted that it was from my account. I ended the call by saying that I will making a police report on this. I have also informed HSBSC.
Scammer called saying he is from Singtel. he said that they detected fraudulent activity from my house network and requested that we connect a laptop to the network to check. when i told him nobody is at home, he put down the phone immediately. He had a very thick Indian accent.
I met him from tantan app. He's profile was verified. We talked a little bit and we moved to Whatsapp to talk better. He showed me himself on video call, which was right. Same person as on the page. About a week later he told me about investment, since I seen him I started to trust him. He got from me around 2200 eur and told if I want to withdraw I have to pay an interest fee of 25% of the withdrawal amount. He told me too late I HAVE to. Refused to pay until we meet face to face, which somehow I knew will never happen. He disappeared, I found him from douyin.
I was contacted by someone called "Emily" from Telegram (+65 8899 7714) telling me that "You can earn $10-$300 commission per day. If you submit 30 tickets with continuous complete sights for 30 days, you will receive a monthly around of $1800". I was told to register my account into a website (http://www.growthopsl.top/) [NOTE: Scam site, do not click] in order to earn commission by uploading movie tickets. For a start, i earn $13 commission and was received into my bank account from (DARREN CHANG ZHONG WEI). In order to continue with the mentioned services, i was inform to liaise with a Whatsapp customer service (+65 88507039) to get the bank account number for the deposit. Hence, i deposited $100 into the account (Borhan Bin xxxxxxxx, Account: 012802xxxxx, Standard Chartered Bank) to continue earning commission from the website. While i was commencing the services, i was told that i have strike a premium ticket which i will need a pay for the premium of $331. After so, i make a deposit to the above mentioned bank account number, but after the top-up i was told that i had strike the premium ticket again and have to pay $559 for the premium. I felt suspicious and started questioning them on the premium. The initial girl "Emily" told me to top-up in order to qualify and withdraw back all my funds, the customer service also told me that i was given till 13/04/2022 1800 hrs before my account will be frozen. After thinking about the matter carefully, i realised that it could be a scam. Hence, I decided to make a police report early so that you can conduct the investigation early before they start to scam more innocent people.
The box office scam is back, if it was ever gone. I got contacted on telegram by a Jason and a Janet Lai. Did not manage to get their numbers though.

I happened to know this lady through Facebook dating. She gave her line contact ai510710. I added her and she told me she was providing massage service for $100 2 hours. I spent some time talking to her. She was very nice and sweet on line. She keep asking me to get her massage but i didn't. Later on, she persisted and I did go to her place at 210 hougang street 21 #01-57 (which is a 7-11 store) very "smart". I told her i will come late and she did wait for me. After i reached the place, she asked me to go 7-11 to buy apple card which i didn’t understand. I said why need to go through the trouble to buy something. She asked me to take photo of 7-11 and said i was not sincere to buy the Apple card. According to my friend, he mentioned that the Apple card was a scam. Once the card was bought, she would ask for the code on the apple card and she would disappear. She asked me to buy a $100 card, and i could be scammer by her trick. I wished to warn everybody not to fall for this kind of apple card scam. They could earn some commission via the apple card value. They would never appear once the deal is over.

Hopefully others would make an informed choice. do be careful.

He goes on to ask for my parents and brothers full name and their occupation. next ask about my monthly pay and banking information ie how many bank accounts i have and how much cash i had in hand/home. Daniel mobile no is indicated in my mobile as +65 9358 2689.

The IPOS officer claimed he was from IPOS and I had registered a trademark which is a copyright offence to another well-known trademark. The officer requests me to head down to their singapore office immediately. I explained that i didn't register any logo. The call is then directed to a manager who repeats the same thing. i explained again i never did it and have nothing to provide. it becomes a conflict. my husband stepped in and raised it is suspicious. so we ended the call and contacted 999. no policy report is filed because there is no financial lost. Things to share: i am always alert to foreign numbers and (+65) numbers, but the phone numbers dialed in are local numbers: 81318430, 81317260, 81349414, 81349408.
We got to know as a match via Bumble and then he suggested we talk over telegram; which I did. He shared me the website (https://integrityenergysolutionsinc.com/index.html) and said that is his company which he wants me know more about him. I did check and confirm the founder info together with the photo is consistent with the one i have at bumble profile; because of that i ruled out the possibility of love scam and lower down my alert. When we chatted on Telegram, he showed presented himself to be a highly committed person and willing to man up; very good at sweet talks, aggressively expressing he is very keen on me and is willing to build our future together. He is working as civil engineer and now engaged in a offshore project on oil rig. after this project, he will have all the finance resource to move the company from us to singapore as he feel as asian, he got biased at us and would like to settle down in singapore if he manage to find the right partner. It went all good; we chat in morning and night due to limited access at internet on the rig, as claimed by him. and then one day, he said there is an incident incurred at the rig, one of his major machine is broken down and need to replace a critical part in order to wrap up the project. it rings a bell to me and i try to play cool. then finally, he asked me for a help of usd2,000-3,000 as he run out his budget and only need this fund then he could finish the project and then come to singapore to meet me up. i instantly feel this is a scam and confronted him that he was a liar. he then appeared to be upset and replied how could i insult him over him asking for help. That was the last conversation we had and after a week, he delete all the chat history at telegram. i did research online and saw a lot oil rig scram which is very similar to what i encountered. From then i could confirmed it is indeed a love scam.

I knew Justin (jwc) from facebook and he portrayed a luxurious life with strong forex trading. Taking a leap of faith, I opened a trading account and made money at first. He then asked me to pool the money with him as he is having too many customers and hard to do the trading 1 by 1. He also have some investors to transfer money to me and said that it can be held as a collateral and profit disbursement as his personal bank account is constantly maxed out with transactions daily. Things started to get ugly when he couldn't give us back the weekly profit as promised. i then received a text saying that i may have transferred money to an account related to an investment scam which i made a police report promptly. His investors that transferred money to me also made police report against him but as the money was transferred to me before RELEASING to him, i'm now implicated and my bank account is frozen. i called up the investigation officer and was told that i'll be called down for an investigation. I now live in anxiety as i have 2 young daughters and a wife to feed and this happened just because i trusted his forex investments.

I received a phone call from a person claiming to be from the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore. The caller spoke in Mandarin and claimed that I've some infringement cases against me.

I just received a phone call from a Mr Eric Ho (caller id.+65 6470 2669) claiming he works at The hsbc Jurong branch. With a typical Singaporean accent he was trying to convince me that he had stopped a fraudulent transaction of $135,000 yesterday from my account and again today another $140,000 was also stopped by him. When I told him I do not even have a HSBC account, he then said that there could be someone impersonating me with my particulars and to report it to the police. He even confidently told me to verify his status by calling the bank on their toll free number 1800 472 2669. He knew my name and without giving him any other information,I decided to hang up the phone. He immediately call me back before i could check the website and i rejected his call I decided to check The website and call The help desk 1800 472 2669 which was indeed the number he gave me. True to my suspicion, he was a fraudster and was not an employee with HSBC Jurong. He was a confident and convincing conman and if i have an account with hsbc I could have been con to give my personal details to him.

I had received a call on my fixed line on 4 April at 9.50am (SGT). The caller (lady) said the call was to inform me that my home wifi security was breached and that there were 20 unauthorised users on it. I was then transferred to a "senior engineer" (male). I was asked to run a series of prompts on my laptop. 1) run CMD 2) I was asked to type assoc - and to verify the CLSID - which he could recite with no error 3) he then asked me to type in iexplore gg.gg\mvkc8 on run -&gt; this was to get me to download a file UltraViewer_setup_6.5_en.exe and to get me to install it and give him remote access to my laptop. 4) at this point I already know something is wrong, so I asked him to hold while I call Singtel (my service provider) on my hp. He hung up once he heard the Singtel automated voice ongoing. While on the line with Singtel Customer (i called 1688 at 10.21am (SGT), I told the agent what happened. While she shared that their officers will not do such things, I asked if there is any way to track the caller as I want to make a police report on this scam. I was told that it is not possible, and I could activate caller id so that I will not be entertaining such calls in the future. I had written to Singtel officially to lodge the case as well as to retrieve the caller's information if possible. They are aware that I'll be making a report on this as well.

He claims to be an property agent and was asking for $500 deposit for.booking/reservation for appointment for viewing the property for RENTAL (261c Punggol Way) I also noticed someone was trying to alert other people in the Facebook groups about this scammer. Editor's Note:There is no need to pay an agent to secure a viewing appointment. Please verify the agent's contact details by checking the advertised number against the Real Estate Council's registry (search under "Salesperson"). If the search does not lead to a property agent’s profile page, it means that the phone number is not registered with CEA by any property agent, and could be an indication that the advertisement is a scam. We encourage you to check the property agent’s details in the property listing against the CEA Public Register to verify that the property agent is registered with CEA. You can do so by searching for the property agent on the CEA Public Register using the advertised phone number.
Received a call on my home phone in the morning at 9+am from a lady with a thick accent claiming she's from our internet company. she explained something about them receiving complaints about the internet connection lately and was calling us to help us check and improve our internet. i couldn't understand her well so i passed the phone to my husband. It must have sounded pretty convincing because my husband was answering many technical questions about the blinking of lights on the router and turning a laptop on upon her request. She then passed the phone to a guy on her end who was apparently the internet technician. The man was polite asking how my day was, but when I asked how long this would take, he went silent and passed the phone right back to the first lady. I repeated my question and she said it would take half an hour, so I asked her to call back in the afternoon. she suddenly insisted that i pass the phone back to the "main owner" (my husband) to get his permission to call back in the afternoon. it was all so strange, but she agreed to call back later then hung up.
The scammer called me and asked for my fin number and full name. he then proceeded to tell me that I have a credit card bill of around 7K SGD. I do not even have a credit card yet, let alone a bank account in Singapore. Initially, they called on WhatsApp with the number: +1(928)3613776.
I first met "Christine" through telegram on February 2022, who introduced herself as a employee at Hudson global resources. She asked whether I am interested in a part time job, which I agreed to. Afterwards she transferred me to a client named "Klay". He introduced me to the website www.z-digimind.com. He said that I need to click on 80 submissions to get a $500 weekly pay. However, there will be times where I need to deposit my own money in order to proceed, otherwise i cannot withdraw any money. As I continued to use the website, the deposit seemed to get larger, to the point that I cannot pay up. Since I did not complete my orders, I have lost $10,000 to them. So, I wanted people to be wary about unsolicited jobs offers on social media platforms like WhatsApp and telegram, and any job offers that require you to "submit data" in order to get commissions. Be careful of those job offers that require you to deposit your own money in order to use their services. These are most likely a scam and may cost you lots of money like what happened to me.

I met an Online friend through tinder and she introduced side business website [http://p.vv.meedify.com] [NOTE: Scam website, do not click]. She said this side business can return 10-15% profit every day, with the help of her so-called uncle who has learnt about the data to earn profit. at first, I rejected it, but she kept pushing and encouraging me which at last I decided to try it out.For the first 2 times [100 &amp; 1000], I'm able to send and receive the money from the website, through online transfer to the account given by the online customer service. For the 3rd time [2000], she urged to increase the amount [To 5000], because of the high accuracy data on that day. So I top up to 5000, and suddenly the customer service replied that I have received a top up prize of 888, which made me redeeming the prize. Then she told me that, after redeeming the prize, I have to top up the amount at least with the multiple of 3, else I'm not able to receive back the money from the website which turn out to be true that I could not receive the money from the online customer service. then she said that due to the calculated data by her uncle, only the amount of 30000 has more stable data. So after all the struggle, I did increase the amount and completed the steps as she told. After that, I went back to the online customer service to asked for withdrawal. Then turned out that the online customer service replied that my account has been frozen due to some inappropriate way of transaction [screenshot 1]. They claimed that I need to top up the full amount of the money that I have in the website to unfreeze the account. From then, I knew this should be a scam. Note that for the above, she has been providing me screenshots of her doing all the top up and even the frozen account and unfreezing the account, and for all the trap that I have faced, she also showed to me that she's also the victim, which made me fall into the trap every time up until account being frozen. Although she has proven to me that she successfully unfroze her account [screenshot 2], but I decided not to continue top up as it might be another trap of her/website. In conclusion, I felt it was my lack of awareness that caused this things to happen. Hence, I hope that my story can help warn others of this job scam.
The scammer is using direct video call in whatsapp. The number +923408605596 and it has a SPF logo as profile picture. Once you answer the call, the scammer in SPF uniform, cap with mask on, it is a blue black ground with SPF logo will speak to you. First he asked that he received a complaint and wanted to see your IC on the video. He identifies by a name and shows a SPF badge on the video. Upon further enquiry he tells , he is calling from SPF Jurong Hq. However, his cover broke when asked there are several SPF offices in Jurong and which one he is calling from. Over time he is going to get better at remembering the locations of spf offices and this is first time I came across such attempt. The setup was very realistic and can fool people easily on its authenticity as what i could feel.
I received a Whatsapp video call using Singapore Police logo, posing as Singapore Police. almost picked it up, then i noticed the number doesn't event originate from Singapore, but uses country calling code +92 (Pakistan), so i added the number to my special blocked contacts list (Ministry of Scams ☺).
Long Story short. Tinder match, foreigner, want to talk to me on whatsapp. But not the rush kind of thing, we talk a little. I feel like there is a real person behind. So i've said ok. We talk each other, politely. No meaningfull word, just standard conversation. She said she is daughter of a banker in singapore. I said wow, unbelievable ect ect... She send pictures, i send it to. explain my situation, very kind with me. Talk about crypto, investement in shaddy crypto "LASERO" "RODC"... Can't find anything on internet. (website is lasero.top with https// of course...) she show me some graph, and talk to me via audio messages to gain trust with me. Again very polite. She is Millionnaire, beautifull, drive a ferrari and a Rolce Royce. Whe talk a lot about this investment. i said, i don't have enough money to invest 1k$ she said ok, i'll give 500 usdt to complete. I did receive the 500 usdt on my fake Lasero cryptowallet. the address is real, but i've never received the 500usdt on etherscan. i've checked too late. So i've insert 500 usdt in a cryptowallet that doesn't mine. Oh, i almost forgot, she talk about the security at the blockchain was maintain by the chuangjia group. Can't find anything above all i've said above. Don't be fooled by online friends, guys! Do your research first before investing and not believe anything at face-value!
A man called claiming to be marcus to be from HSBC bank -saying that there are huge transfer of funds from my hsbc account. eg. 100K transfer from HSBC jurong west etc and another transaction just happen of transfer of 145K to ocbc bank. Firstly, I indicated that I don't have hsbc account and he read out some account number. next I asked to speak to the manager in charge and I was put on hold and later he returns to say that the manager is occupied. Finally he said that his manager will call back. After the call, I tried calling the number 62752669 - it rings but no one pick up now, the "so called manager" called jerry koh from jurong east HSBC again telling me I have done a transfer. And the account ending 4489 on feb 16 this year at jurong east branch. When I challenged that I wanted to call back. he actually give me hsbc hotline number 18004722669. Next, I called hsbc hotline and listen to the lengthy voice response message while waiting for someone to pick up the call. Finally, I get to speak to hsbc hotline and confirm that there is no such person called jerry koh at HSBC.
Very attractive msg offering quick loans, when u click link, it brings to one Danny, sounds young, not conversant in english, he ask for your NRIC front &amp; Back plus names of 2 family members to submit to "His Boss" for approval. He only text u &amp; refuses to meet up in person or let u go to his office. He tells u it is approved &amp; wants to disburse the next day. Then, he asked for several thousands to deposit into their new account, which he promised will be returned when they disburse the loan. After the transfers are done, he tells you that he forgets to collect GST from you. He insisted it has to be paid before the loan disbursement. 7% or S$21000. I asked for invoice &amp; GST number of his company. Bearing in mind, i still don't know if it was company or personal private loan. He assured me i will get the agreement &amp; GST invoice. When the 4 page loan agreement came, I had already transferred the full "GST" of $21,000.00 to some dodgy personal accounts. Meantime, still no deposits. Next day, he called to inform Boss wants me to pay $15,000.00 premiums for insurance cover. At this point, i realised i had been conned. They just wanted me to send money to them every day with no intention of giving me the loan. By this time, I had parted $30,000+. I refused to pay the insurance unless the loan is disbursed to me. They resorted to thugs to harass my phone &amp; my husband too. They even sent videos of paints splashings on other house &amp; threatened to visit my home. Just be aware, I did not get a single cent, lost $30,000, and they wanted me to pay them $15,000.00. What did they do? Outright scamming, on the pretext of offering cheap loans. Pure gangsters. Unbelievable. Editor's Note: Licensed moneylenders cannot advertise their services online, including social media, via messaging apps, SMSes or cold calls.

I got matched with this account on tinder going by the name Emma, ethnicity Chinese, who wanted to instantly move the conversation to WhatsApp. The WhatsApp account was setup under a name "jamie chen" (different from tinder) with no profile picture. The phone number used on WhatsApp was a voip from a voip app (+65 3129 6665) which can be created in less than 5 minutes using a VPN. The conversation went on for a few days when they finally asked me to setup an account on okex (crypto exchange) and then shared the link to add 100-500 usdt on it promising that they will make me profit from it. The link was obviously phishy and i never opened it but it would most likely have phished my crypto exchange passwords or simply went away with the 100-500 usdt i add to the platform. I did not figure this entire thing out from the very beginning and only started getting suspicious as days went on. Beware guys, no hot girl wants to help you make money on crypto hours after you match on Tinder.
I came across an ad on locanto for “service” ($100/90 mins), I decided to book an appointment thru line to meet her. When i reached there, i contacted her and she told me that i would need to make a payment to prevent any police for checking. She asked me to pay me thru Razer Gold at AXS machine which i thought was weird at first and i was expecting the cash payment instead. I was naive to believe her "police-checking" story and fell for the it which i paid $100 to her. After the payment, she said someone will call me to verify that i am not with the police. After that, the guy that claimed to be her manager contacted me and asked to pay a series of deposit( 1. To confirm I am not a police, 2. To protect the girl, 3. Hotel deposit, …..)They told me that the money will be returned after the whole thing. I was naive to paid till the hotel deposit portion and realised it was a scam. So, I told the person I wanted to cancel the service, but he told me in order to take back whatever I paid, i need to pay all the deposit, when I told him I got no money, exceeded daily limit etc, he threaten to hurt my family. So I tell him I will look for him the next day. So ya now I chance upon this site and I blocked and reported the number on WhatsApp and line.
Telegram msg by a person called grace. referred to another guy called billy (89158526) . same thing, asked to create an account in the website, also invited to another whatsapp group with many believable admins and 'newcomers'. as previous stories stated, posting food, live withdrawals etc to make the whole story look believable. will list out the numbers of the active numbers in the group that posted messages. but darn its so believable. they even made another 'fellow newcomer' to msg u separately and social engineer u to just 'give it a try'. should be all fake names and all, but just for reference Admin: Billy: 89158526 Karen: 89180680 Christina Chong: 89250248 FAKE 'Newcomers': Aloychew: 80135349 Jacky: 89163895 website used was https://www.p-digitrio.com/index/index/home.html https://www.n-digitrio.com/index/index/home.html
i received a call on my landline saying that he is calling from Singtel technical department on 28 Mar 2022. he was telling me that there is unusual data usage traffic for my broadband and telling me that he will go ahead and block the unauthorised user. he needed me to be in front of my computer or laptop. i believe what he has said and i gave my mobile number to him so that i can access to my desktop. but when he called me again on my mobile phone, 1st time, the phone number shown on my mobile number is a number from cuba and 2nd time, show as +65 8811 2112 (singapore). I answered it but found the caller and number are suspicious so i quickly hang up the phone after talking for a few seconds. i have called singtel regarding this scam and singtel have confirm that they will not make such call to their customers. I wish my experience will help to raise awareness of scams to other people.
I was connected via Telegram when a person asked if am keen in job. Then refer me to another person to share more details. This person whose name is mickey shared me the link to register. Then continue to show me how to complete the ratings online. As a trial, i was given $100 and i earn $10 from the trial which i can withdraw immediate. However, to continue doing so, i will need to deposit $100 which i also transfer. The rating consists of 30 per set and we need to complete 1 set to be able to withdraw. When am on my 18 ratings, i was prompted that i won a deluxe ratings which can earn more comm from the usual cents to dollars. However, to be able to claim the comm, I will need to deposit more money as this is a deluxe attraction and my $100 is not enough. I feel something fishy at this moment, and checked back with the agent. And of course, you know they will say you are lucky, is a rare sight and ask you to proceed to deposit as all this deposit will eventually be refunded to you. I have seen many scam stories here and how scammers MIA with your money. Hence, i stop all my actions and rest my mind. This morning, i woke up with a clear mind and shared this story. This incident happen on 27 march 2022, website is: https://www.messgeklineq.top/
I received a call from the number and he pretended to be a friend of mine. I told him that I didn't remember who he was and stopped playing with me or fooling around. Then he kept On saying "dont u remember me?" in mandarin and hung up after a few tries. When i tried calling back, the ringIng sounds like an overseas call. So, i didn't pursue calling this weIrd number again.
Just happen today even. Was on heymandi. She just came and message me about it. So at first was half believe and half doubt that it is a sex scam, but I still choose to message her because I wanted to believe her. She asked me to meet her at Chua Chu Kang mrt station, after that, she ask me go atx to buy " mycard point " for her so she can exchange it with her boss.( Clearly she didn't talk about that.) After that I told them( the boss called me to teach me how to get the point) I can't buy the point, so they ask me go lot one 711 to buy apple pay card/ razer gold card. I did, which I'm regretting to do so even though I end up buying it. So the boss asked me to scratch the card and tell him the PIN in order for them to redeem the value. I told him, and then he asked me to take a photo of that and send to the girl. Which I clearly didn't. I and very stopid end went to blocked their numbers, they still tried to scared me with some scary video where people die by someone who knifed them and said if I don't pay I will be next. Guys don't fall on it pls it a trap. I just read all the stories and many shared the same story like mine. Beware of such Credit-for-Sex scams.
A Malaysian Chinese-speaking guy called me at about 1.39pm today. I asked him who is he. He claimed he is my friend that I used to work with. I didn't mention any names. He said he is Alex after i keep probing for his name. He said he lost some belongings and is outside police station now. Then he started his story like some ppl stole his stuff etc. After i let him briefly finish his story, i told him not to do such immoral scams to ppl. He cursed me straight away and hung up on me before I could say any more things.
I met him.on a dating app. He mentioned he is a marine engineer and have 2 yrs contract with keppel and will be coming out in oct 21. Later, he mentioned he needs to go malaysia for some repair works and mentioned his accounts in US were blocked and requested me to open bank account on his behalf. I have no idea where all his source of money come from. And each time, he mentioned he needed to pay his worker in Malaysia. Until my own accounts is being blocked by the bank did I realise that it was all a scam.
i received a phone call from the number 62025882, who claimed that she's starndard chartered credit card call center. She informed me that my credit card was used for the purchase at amazon service for the amount of 62,000, then she asked me for my date of birth for verification to proceed the discussion. I got suspicious immediately, so I told her that I'd call the card center direct number to discuss as I can hardly believe what she was saying. After I checked with Standard chartered credit card center, I was convinced that she's a scammer, so I called her back. She answered my call, but when I tried to confront her, she pretended that she couldn't hear me any more. I looked up her number and noticed that there were some people received the same call from her in the past. Do not believe calls requesting for your personal details, expecting ones that are made to you unexpectedly.
Received a phone call from HSBSC (+6564702669) that told me there was fraudulent transactions of $140k on yesterday &amp; $120k today. It was picked up by OCBC for suspected fraud transactions on my current account. I told the person I have no HSBSC account but he insisted I have a current a/c obtained legally. He was very convincing telling me his name was Louise Chow from HSBSC Jurong br, it a serious fraud case to deal with. I spoke with him a while, he said the transaction already went through only the $120k was stopped. He asked me to confirm that i didn't make the transactions. He said they already reported to cad and need me to also make a report. He said he will redirect his call to cad for me, a link he said established with banks to report fraud. I said no and I would come to the branch to meet him. I went to HSBSC Jurong branch within an hour, there i was told by the bank staff, the branch staff informed me that there was no such person and I have no current account with HSBSC. Normally these +65 scam calls are either recorded or foreign accent callers, this is one sound like ordinary Singaporean, that's why I got caught into believing he could be real.
A lady with a strong Malaysian accent called me and pretended as my friend and shares that she opened a bakery shop at city plaza. The next day called me again and tried to borrow money from me.
"Singtel" called to said home wifi and one of the communication has been hacked and compromised. I asked the scammer for Singtel company code, he hanged up.
He called me by my name and talked to me in chinese and tried to impersonate as my friend WL in short. I am not too sure if this scam was meant to be elaborate or all coincidence but this is what happened 1) he told me he lost his phone and wallet in malaysia( my friend just told me he is going to malaysia in march) 2) he spoke in strong malaysian accent like my friend 3) he describe himself as short and fat in chinese(exactly my friend) 4) he said he has sore throat to account for voice difference 5) you wont think its a scam because he invited me to come down to a restaurant for free meal in april, he said he invested a bit of money in his friend newly opened restaurant and will call me again nearer to the date to confirm the timing. He asked me if i prefer lunch or dinner etc. 6) next day he called me when i was sleeping but then i just somehow felt something was amiss, because this friend of mine has my instagram, why didnt he message me on insta. 7) i whatsapped his original number and he told me it wasnt him( so luckily, i lost nothing)( probably will call me to borrow number etc) So, if anyone has a friend who calls you out of the blue, please call the old number to check if it is indeed your friend whom you are speaking to!
I received a Telegram message from a recruitfirst agent (anna lim), asking if i needed a job, which i did at the time. She then directed me to her "client" (xue ping) Xue ping then pestered me for a few days until i decided to go and just try whatever she has to offer. After running through what i will be doing, she invites me to a group named "Xue ping", where the group members were all posting their withdrawal amounts and what they're having for lunch, making it seem very believable. The task was rather simple, just to click on "create data" and "submit", which was supposed to be done 42 times, in order to withdraw. Somewhere along the 26th task, the account wallet was insufficient. She then instructed me to send a request deposit to her account by contacting another whatsapp account, ( +65 8946 4823). It even was a business account, making it look even more believable. Multiple times while doing the these tasks, the websites went down saying it was suspected as a scam website by the police, and I was offered with a new link with the excuse of " dear, this is because our company is imitated and used illegally by others, so in order to cooperate with the police so that others are not harmed, so this link is closed and updated to ensure the safety and smooth operation of the system, please wait a moment, we are sorry for the inconvenience and will upgrade the latest website link, thank you." It all seemed really fishy and I wasn't going to put money in. Anyway, so I checked online and it tallied with another article on this website.
I received a call from +65 6393610 and decided to pick it up. heard a beep sound, and someone of a foreign accent answered the phone and started speaking in Mandarin. He was able to identity my full name. i decided to hang it up and he called me again many times. after i blocked the number, i tried calling once to verify if it's a foreign number. when i called back, the automated voiced claimed it was 'cdac'. googled and called cdac main hotline as stated on their official website- 1) number stated on their official webpage is different, 2) phone operator has advised to ignore as i'm the 2nd caller of the day to report.
Received a call from a someone with an Indian slang claiming to be from singtel. said my home wifi is compromised. asked how many blinking and nonblinking lights. asked how many devices are being used but not very patient to get my answers. asked me to switch on my personal laptop connected to the wifi instead of company laptop. he then transferred call to someone from technical team who sounded like a western foreigner (forgot his name), but funnily there is almost no wait time for the transfer. then the technician asked me to open cmd for him to run assoc. I never press enter and hung the call. before hanging the call when i did not reply him, he was worriedly saying "tell me what you are thinking".
A man called my mobile, claiming to to be from Singtel and said my home had internet cyber security threats and wanted to ask if i am the main person using the internet. when i pressed for more info he hung up.
I received a call from +6586308378 and he knew me by name and claimed he was my relative. I sounded puzzled so he kept repeating you are so and so right? I am your relative (all in mandarin), have you forgotten me? I have changed my number. I thought it was real so i was seriously thinking if i have a relative of such (as i do have distance relative in Hong kong and china) and I said i don’t think we have spoken before hence I don't recognize your voice. At the end he just kept reiterating that he was my relative but I don't know where this is going so i said i am not free to chat and he hung up.
The scammer called to say that they are from “ICA” and there is a parcel containing medicine under my name that is not illegal but taxable so it is held back. They describe that I needed to go the 6th floor. Sounded legit, I just woke up , was a bit blur. So i say i will go over to settle, because i did not buy any medicine from overseas but they say there's nothing i can do even if i go over other than explaining what he told me above^. He even handed the phone over to his manager mr "zhang" to say the same thing he said 🙄 but the manager said the medicine is "covid 19 medicine" then I realised it was a scam and hanged up and blocked the number.
It was through Telegram first, they staged it up and contacted me via whatsapp. Subsequently they gave me a link to 'register' myself and receive $25. This is what they shared. 'This is a flexible job, you can work when you free time. The main job is to help merchants on the platform to increase the sales and views of their products and attract more customers to buy', if you are interested, i will give you a web site, register a job number, and then let you learn first', 'if you work for 1 month, you will get a base salary of $1300 and commission, if you don't work for 1 month, you will only get commissions', 'complete 1 mission just get 1%, example this product is $100 so you just get $1', https://www.uk-crimtan.com/.57mv?? was my my invitation code'. This is what the scammer told me
He approached me in Facebook and shortly requested to chat in WhatsApp. He will keep praising how beautiful I am and how much he wants to be with me. he claimed to be residing in UK of Chinese descent from CHINA. His Facebook profile showed him to be a handsome successful gentleman with luxurious LIFESTYLE who also HAS a son. His sweet and straight FORWARD personality in the conversation WAS what I got attracted TO. So i chatted with him for sometime until one day I DISCOVERED THAT it is some public figure from Vietnam instead, which opposed to what he claimed to be. Beware!!!
1) Was contacted by erica ng in telegram, she got my hp from jobs.sg 2) she asked if i was interested in the following job scope "We are Urgently hiring now For FULL/PART time We need candidates in Singapore Non experience candidates are welcome!

Today I got 2 missed calls and then i pick up the call on third time. The caller said it is from moh and the caller verify my name I replied “Yes”. Then I heard some beep sound and talking me in chinese. I said don't understand and then he said he will change to English department then drop the call. (his chinese accent sounded like PRC Chinese). While writing this article, I got another call from the same number and asking me "are you speaking Chinese", to which I replied "no" and then he said he would change to English department. And dropped the call again.
A hacking alert message with voice appeared when I switched on my laptop on 16/03/2022 around evening. Voice message said my laptop had been hacked and stop functioning and required technician to repair the laptop. They requested that I called this contact given from microsoft support centre Singapore for immediate repair. So I called this contact and a man (Indian accent ) received and ask my phone number for technician to return call and hang up. Less than a minute a lady ( indian accent ) called and instructed me to download Team Viewer app for her to control my laptop remotely. He explained how I got the trojan virus and the location which need repair and after repairing (as she claimed) she said that i required to download 4 x firewall programme for banking, mobile, credit card and online purchase. I agreed and she request that i login in to my internet banking so she could copy the address/url address. That is time i realised that i might be scam so i faked stomach ache to go to toilet. I notified DBS immediately to delete internet banking account and all credit cards. After confirming all account/cards deleted i re-engaged the scammer and was instructed again to login into my internet banking (she can see what i'm doing ) which I can't log into. She requested for my credit card and cvv no and after she requested me to gave her a active credit card no and i told her that all my credit cards and internet banking had been deleted. She asked me why I deleted all these, which i explained that you might be a scammer. She told me that she will called later and hanged up. I cannot close my laptop from power off switch, I closed my laptop from main power line and open again after 1 hour later and laptop working normal again.Editor’s Note: We do not encourage members of the public to engage with scammers when you realise who they are interacting with.

Picked up a +65 mobile number and caller identified himself as from Amazon billing dept and asked whether the number that he called is my number I replied him whether he wants me to give me the contact number of singapore police force. He kept quiet then hung the call.
I matched with this "girl" on tinder. She claimed to be from china and worked as a social escort here in Singapore. From tinder, we moved to WhatsApp (malaysian numbers) and then telegram. All conversations were in Chinese as she claimed that she couldn't speak english. I used google translate. But I caught her respond in English once. She claimed that she stayed in a company in Hougang near Hougang MRT and she couldn't go out at all unless clients booked appointments with her. All meals were provided by her company. She told me all sob stories but i remained guarded and played along. When she knew that i was at home after work, she suddenly brought up a story that her boss wanted her to provide sexual service to a client. She asked me for help and wanted me to book an appointment with her because she did not want to do with the pervert client. All i needed is to pay $300 to her boss. She asked me to come to Blk 805 Hougang. Of course, i didn't believe the story. Luckily, i found the "beware of credit-for-sex scams" story here. It's very similar to my situation. The first photo was from tinder. Second one is the screenshot of her telegram bio. I googled her telegram id: @hope1314520. It was really from China.
I got connected via telegram regarding job available. Then was asked to download EAB app from play store. Went through the motion of creating account. Needed to top up money to do missions such as purchasing products. Commission is paid on product purchase. Higher value product for higher commission. In march, there was many events where you top up x value for x cash rebate and x trial bonus. The offer is limited and attractive. However, at 6pm on 15 march, the app was suddenly prompted with messages that police has intervened and request user to top up 30% of your remaining value to prevent account being freeze. The instruction was to follow. At 8pm, the app was not working and the eab admin MIA. The group telegram was gone, app gone, admin gone and of course, my money is gone as well. I believe on 15 march, many would have reported to police. Below is a screenshot i have taken to evidence that I topped up and participate in the events. Note that each time, the payment to the account may varies and user will need to check the account details before transmitting via paynow
I received a robocall mentioning something about MOH and final warning about vaccination status. I just arrived in Singapore so i thought it was something to do with my recent arrival. the call was in english and after that in chinese. it said to press 1 for more details. I stupidly pressed 1 and the call was cut off immediately. Please beware of such impersonation phone calls!
THE caller claimed to be from Lazada and sounded like a male from india. He claimed that a fraudulent a $300+ transaction was detected on my account coming from Germany. The item was supposedly a bottle of perfume, which i had coincidentally bought, but on shopee. He asked if I had family etc in germany who might be using the account. He then proceeded to verify my first name, which he had obtained. "Not to worry, we can stop it" - proceeded to ask for my email, claiming that he had to fill a form. That was a trigger red flag for me as lazada would already have my email (I might have complied if he asked to verify my email), besides all the other red flags on hindsight. i asserted that I should be able to view the transaction in my lazada account, but he said it was still processing, which didn't seem like a satisfactory answer. When I said it was fine, he said he would let the transaction go through and it would be charged to my "Standard Chart" account, which i did not have. So this is an affirmation that it's a scam.
I saw the advertisement on Facebook i thot that it was legitimate job offer so i tried. Then one of the carousellers said it was a scam so i immediately deleted all the listings the scammer told me to list on his behalf and he told me that the scammers were just using me for their scams. I did what he said block his number delete all the listings the scammer told me to list and i did then i thanked the kind soul that alerted me to this scam.
Basically one of those job scams on telegram. Girl named ROSie asked me if I am interested in a job, I can earn 70-210/day. She told me to give my number and someone will contact me on whatsapp. I asked why can't she just give me info on telegram and she said telegram loses information easily. After 2 hours a guy on whatsapp named danny messaged me and asked me to go on this website: www.zz-qlik.com (NOTE: Scam website, do not click). I searched up qlik, it is a legit company that the scammers are impersonating, because it is relatively unheard of to the general public. On the website there is a real address but when i googled that address it belonged to another company, not theirs. Anyway how this scam works is that the person will try to earn your trust by topping up money into your account then 'training' you so that you can kinda take out some money at first, after which you have to top up your own money to complete boost missions. I did not top up of course, and just ignored all other messages from the scammer.
i was sent job invite mentioning from Fayaz travels via Telegram by the name of don when no such business in singapore. I was asked to go to a link to sign up to platform to earn money but i did not even click the link suspecting it as a scam. They impersonated the local company fayyaz travels (registered in singapore)to put up the scam messages.
I suspect that I have been scammed by a man whom I met on instagram (instagram IDs: jin_woo_0001, jeo_jin212, telegram user ID: Chang_121, kakaotalk ID: 인생은 좋다) and identified himself as Jeong Jin Woo, a 31 year old petroleum engineer from Seoul, South Korea. He claimed that he lost both his parents when he was 12 and his birthday is on 19 October 1991. He also claimed that he worked for the Korea National Oil Corporation, and that he left his job one month after we met on Instagram to take up a personal oil rig contract with the Turkish Petroleum Corporation from February 2022 to early April 2022. Shortly after we chatted on Instagram (since 29 December 2021), he requested to move our chat to Telegram (since 31 December 2021). I found out that he was a scam when I recently did a reverse image search of the photos which he had been sending me on Telegram claiming to be of himself and found that they belong to a different person with a different identity on Instagram (instagram ID: jjangga777), after I was nearly duped by a related parcel scam (he tried to send me a parcel from Korea claiming it was for my birthday, and it apparently got stuck at customs and I was required to pay money to the agent before the parcel could be delivered to my doorstep. The transaction was fortunately blocked by my bank who called me to inform me of the scam.). He maintained his innocence even after I confronted him about it. What’s fishy is that he refused to share any other photos of himself not from jjangga777’s Instagram profile and was unable to do a private video call with me to prove his innocence (claiming that rig security forbids video calls). He even sent me a fake passport ID to "proof his innocence". However, by the time I found this out I had already transferred a total of $55,625 on various occasions to different bank accounts. On the first occasion, he claimed that he needed to pay the transport driver for the equipment he ordered otherwise his equipment would be stuck at the sea port. On the second occasion, he claimed that there was an engine plug explosion and he needed the money to replace the engine plug. On the 3rd occasion, he claimed that the $30000 was for a second-hand engine plug and he needed to top up additional money to get a brand new engine plug to continue with the project (otherwise everything would be on a standstill). He had promised to come to Singapore to meet me in early April 2022 after the end of his project (I am still in contact with him) and he would return me the money before that but I have doubts that he would do so given that he has not been who he claims to be. Sharing this story to prevent others from being duped by this man.
I met "Yoyo" through Tinder. after chatting for a while, she asked to move to telegram. We quickly became friends, and it was nice chatting with her. her story of coming to Singapore from hong kong to do a family business with her dad seemed believable. Things took a turn when we started talking about crypto. she shared how she made money and that i should consider trying. she would guide me as well. she sent me a link, and told me to register. (please dont click on this link: https://h5.j5f8g3zn.xyz/). It brought me to a shady crypto exchange, and thankfully i know quite a bit about crypto and used some exchanges before. she said it was a uk-based exchange called "transact". the login from the link was different from the "transact" uk exchange that i googled. it had some similarities with exchanges, but mainly require real fiat money, instead of any crypto wallets, which had unique wallet addresses. then she would rush me to top up $500 (it was the minimum amount), and i went to search how to do so. she said use whatsapp to customer service, and the number is +852 6371 6255. It was really suspicious already. Definitely not the right way to do a transaction on a crypto exchange. she kept asking me if i had recharged already or not, and sent me screenshots of her earning some money. when i asked her about her strategy to buy and sell, she said some really confusing terms, that i have not heard of in technical analysis: "Because the transaction node is coming soon, we must seize this opportunity. We combine the 24H K-line chart, and judge the rise and fall of the node according to the trend of the Yang line". When I expressed more concern, she said it made our relationship weird and blamed me for not trusting her. When i told her that i wanted to meet her and see how she does it in-person, she changed the topic. even if she stays very near me, she said she don't have time on weekdays. this was extremely suspicious.and after a few hours when I ignored her messages, i realised the chat with her on tinder was already deleted/gone. i have read some other scam stories where they managed to top up, and really made some money, which caused them to top up more, due to greed. but when the withdrawal comes, they are unable to do it, saying they need to hit a certain amount before withdrawing, and after that the "customer service" says withdrawal has some problems etc. My case could have turned into this, but luckily i stayed vigilant. sometimes when it is too good to be true, it may really be.
Elaine contacted me on telegram stating that there is a job, and asked for my contact number and her colleague will send me a whatsapp message. Hee Kian - messaged me on whatsapp to sign up at a link p-inmobi.com and use his referral code. joined a whatsapp group of 10 other people with the group name "hee Kian". Guided me along to do the 42 tasks. There was a new member in hee kien group named "Yi ling" that messaged me. it took me a while to realise that she was in on the scam too as she was showing me that she topped up money and such. however, the amount in her screenshot doesn't tally and it was just super suspicious as she had all the answers to my doubts. Somewhere around 35 task, the account wallet was insufficient. He then instructed me to send a message to another whatsapp number to ask for top-up into his account. hee kian Managed to top up 3 times before completing the 42 tasks due to insufficient balance. Somewhere in between, the initial website was down due to "imitation" and i was redirected to another website q-inmobi.com This is obviously a job scam.
Received a call from the above number on whatsapp and the caller asked for my nric number and claimed to be from the Ministry of Manpower but his phone number was an overseas number.
Was contacted by Kelly via telegram and claimed she is from “Peoplesearch”. Told her I am looking for weekend part-time jobs and she shared she has something that suits my requirements. She asked for my name and contact number and informed that someone from the hiring company will reach out to me to share more details. Then on 26 February 2022, a man named Marcus claimed he is from criteo and is hiring to help optimize data content and visibility etc. On the website or third-party mobile platforms to increase traffic and provide revenue stream. with all questions asked, I registered a profile with criteo http://www.o-criteo.com/ and Marcus taught me how to do the job and withdraw the money. He also added me to this WhatsApp group which he claims is his team which he has built. There was also one guy named ‘Soo heng who joined the group at the same time as me and pm-ed me asking if this job is legit. He was also trying to be friendly. (I am now 100% sure this ‘Soo heng is also their accomplice). This job requires you to complete 43 data sets, but midway you will be prompted to recharge the negative value to complete the job. (they claimed you strike the bonus data and have to recharge the negative value for 3 times to unlock the data and continue the job. The “bonus data” gives higher commission). For the first few attempts, the recharge value was minimal and I was able to complete the first 3 jobs and get paid (along with the amount I recharged). Things got fishy in late Feb when http://www.o-criteo.com/ got suspended. I checked with the group chat and they shared they are not scam and that the company will constantly upgrade their website to ensure the security of the system. Marcus gave new links to the criteo website - https://www.t-criteo.com/ and https://www.i-criteo.com/ to do the job. I did the last and final job and the recharge value went insanely high from a range of sad 800 to sad 13,000. Which system is so “smart” and “random” and assigns you another bonus data once you finished recharging for the last bonus data? Obviously, it is rigged. That is when I know they are scammers and I already had sad 13,000 locked in their platform.Marcus and counterparts will say things like "just a bit more and you can take out all your cash that you recharged. The bonus data is so good, you will sure get fat commissions." they also kept telling you that you have to find money to top up within certain time frame, otherwise the account will be frozen due to non-completion of job and complain by merchants. Scammers nowadays can outright register themselves under ACRA and impersonate legitimate human resource firms for such malicious acts. Key takeaway, no jobs will ask you to pay money first before you do any work.
Received two calls in quick succession from +658824025?. Picked up on the second call as I thought it might be legitimate. Chinese singaporean male spoke in chinese, called me by my chinese name and said he changed his number. I asked who the caller was. person did not identify himself, but instead used my english name and repeated that he changed his number and asked me not to pretend that i didn't know who was calling. I promptly hung up.
Call you to say she is friend of yours who lost her wallet and mobile phone. Telling you that this is her new number and using her old mobile phone that had been previously damaged by water. The following day she will call again to ask for help and needed money ($1000) . Accepting via paynow transfer.
Beware of this tactic used by the scammer. The scammer used an existing number, which in this case is 91175???, and call me early in the morning. They then left a voicemail stating that they are from ICA. When I called back the number, the person who answered the call claimed that she did not call me at all. Scammers will randomly spoofed numbers in order to avoid detection and to fool users into picking up their calls. The difference is the "+" prefix which shows that the call originate from overseas, so beware!
A young chinese man contacted me via people nearby in wechat and was very well mannered. His display picture is of a very good looking male, together with a picture of a bmw, lots of cash and also apple products. He asked to be friends and then immediately he would go on to say he is the agent of a clothe brand. He would then be really friendly and ask you more about yourself and try to call. I had already suspected he was a scammer and gave him short replies but he still continued to text. He would then tell me he was looking at bitcoins and also make random romantic comments. He would then try and audio call me, which i never picked up. Then he would leave voice messages via wechat to ask why i had not picked his calls. I told him to video call me if he wanted to chat which he didn't so this confirmed my suspicions and i have blocked him. came here to share so that ladies do not fall into this scam. beware as this should be the reported romantic investment scam. No loss and i blocked him within 4 days.

Started with WhatsApp conversation with this lady stated on the above number .she mention about joining the group of individual to create data using the criteo platform thru online , which u will receive a certain commission.

And also to create awareness to people and be vigilant in dealing with strangers online so for safety of everyone.
Answered a call from the number mentioned above (+98 63 9693 1549), got an automated recorded message mentioning Singapore High Court and a document. Given the country code and recorded message i already know it is a scam call. The message prompted me to press "2". The call was redirected to a human and a lady answered in English asking me how she could assist me (no idea why they use that line, because clearly they called me rather than the other way around!). After I tried to fool them, the lady hung up the call. I wanted to share this encounter to warn others of this scam.
Received an SMS claiming to be SingTel stating i have paid my feb singtel bill twice and i may click on the link in the sms to request for a refund. Have called SingTel to verify there was no duplicate payment for my feb bill via the giro plan.
I met this Chinese china guy on CMB. We started to converse on telegram. He'd call me and we'd chat. It was all chill comfortable and we agreed to just be friends. Within 2 weeks, he recommended me to this Fortis app, citing that it's a game site allowing you to earn some money by playing number games. He insisted that it was cos he wanted us to earn money tgt. He must think I’m dumb! Anyways, I tried to refuse and he even expressed that he'd transfer me money if I lost any in the game. But then, it was super obvious he was getting pushy, so I resolutely rejected his offer. He started getting abusive and got into the guilt trip approach, citing that I didn't trust him enough to see that he wants the best for us both. What a joke! He got so riled up and started using chinese vulgarities and was cursing my parents. It's obvious he was lashing out cos his plans didn't work out. I'm thankful that I didn't get scammed. I've since blocked him but thought I’d share this to warn people off any investment/gaming sites/strange apps that requires you to play by first depositing your own money into the platform. How sketchy!
Received a automated call from ministry of health on emergency message, press "3" to have a communication with the staff and I shut the phone call.
I received a WhatsApp call on from this number: 12026604262. I normally will ignore calls from +XX numbers but this one had the MOM logo as profile picture which made me hesitate, so I picked up. A man with ian strong Indian accent identified himself as calling from MOM and started to make small conversation, asking me how was I. At this point, I decided to end the call without saying anything further. While nothing was lost, I wanted to share this encounter to warn others of this ongoing scam.
Scammers are misusing DBS brand to send phishing email. Beware guys! The email used rewards to get users to do a survey but the link is to a phishing site. Don't fall for it.

Was approached via telegram by Jessy from “Trust recruit pte ltd”. Then, I was forwarded to winny on WhatsApp, her number is 89036365 on 05 march. So on 05 march, I got the profit and deposit that I put into the platform upon completion of 2 sets of 40 data. But on 06 march, they keep asking for higher deposit. And if I don't deposit, I would not be able to finish the set of 40 data and unable to retrieve back my deposited amount. I deposited a total of $4179 through 5 paynow transfer to a “mohammad fa??i”. I did not get that deposit of $4179 back because I refused to deposit more money into the platform thus not able to complete the 40 data and no withdrawal can be made until you completed each set of 40 data.

This scam uses the name of IDA, covid-19 as an excuse that we are able to claim some money if our business or livelihood gets affected by covid-19. Someone used my aunt's facebook account to send FB messenger to me, saying she claimed 150K business claims from ida that helps people during covid-19. said will send us a private link to help submit for claim and said was a global program. Thought i was really talking to my aunt at first, but then i started to wonder what business was she doing to claim so much, and why use messenger instead of normal whatsapp? so i called her and realised she didn't send such things.
I met him on a dating app. After chatting with him, he ask whether we can chat on telegram. Afterwards, we start chatting in Chinese. He keep trying to persuade me to invest in Bitcoin saying it was a really good rate. He tried getting me to download the app. When I say I couldn't, he sent me another LINK https://h5.hifly66381.top [Note: Do NOT click] After using a new email account to create a account on said website, it seems more like a scam as the rate of Bitcoin is different from online. Not to mention, he directed me to use WhatsApp to top up money in the account which is a shortcut. The WhatsApp has a china number. Thinking that it is a scam, I lied saying I need to go off. Even then he was saying the rate is good and I should not let the opportunity go to waste, it's so obvious that it's a scam.

Activa media's website url and address have been misused by scammers as a gimmick to prey on potential applicants. Scammers are offering commissions applications for taking up a part-time jobs and no contract is required. Not only that, they also mentioned the company will pay the victims accordingly for completing an order. They will share a group link in the whatsapp with you and once you join the work group, someone will instruct you. All the numbers in the group chat are not real number. You will not be able to reach them as they only liaise via whatsapp. Please search for the official website URL and call the company to verify the job vacancy if in doubt.

Fake call about mom covid survey: I received a phone call from someone claiming to be "michael cha" from the mom, ministry of manpower. He stated they were conducting a survey about covid and asked if I could answer a few questions. I said "okay", and he asked me if i was a citizen or pr, how long I’d been living in Singapore, and if I was vaccinated, and how many vaccines. It seemed standard, but his accent was very thick and not Singaporean. He set off alarms when he effusively praised me for getting vaccinated and called me a "hero of the nation" (that was weird and not at all how government agents talk). But his next question was "what's your ic number?". Then i was more sure it was a scam, so I told him I wasn't comfortable giving that information over the phone. He got immediately angry and threatened to cancel my PR status and have me thrown out of the country. "we are a nation of laws sir, you are breaking the law and will be punished if you do not follow my instructions." I asked him which law I was breaking in refusing to give out my ic number over the phone and to cite the exact page number of the law. He said he had the authority to do as he wished, and I would be deported. I told him "good luck deporting me and hung up."
Received a call saying "you have a court case, please press 9" After pressing 9, a person picked up asking for court number. This person's conversational english sounds convincing without any 'china' accent, sounded professional. As i did not have a 'court number' to inform, he asked me for my personal particulars to check on his system. I kept on asking him for my particulars, which he is unable to give me. He asked for my particulars again, which i did not give. He ended the call eventually.

Got to know this guy from Hinge by the name of Aiden. Conversation started normal then he will start introducing investing in cryptocurrency. He then gave you a link which linked you to this oriental wealth in mandarin and hkd. You are supposed to recharge fund via their recharge customer service team WhatsApp. The so-called customer service officer would give you random bank account to bank in the money. For the first investment it will be successful then this Aiden guy will ask you to invest more thereafter the link will not be accessible and you have to contact customer service which is another hk number. They will tell you that system under maintenance. After the system is up, this aiden guy will tell you that we missed the good timing to buy nodes and that we need to invest even more. Fast forward to next day when they say you can withdraw the money. Their cs will tell you to pay tax and then your account will be frozen due to suspicious transaction and whatnot. That may seem like a long story but all these will happen within a day or 2. Just wanna share my experience to all of you, when the guy you know from hinge, tinder …. Etc gets pushy and persistent on asking you to invest. Something is very wrong. And if you were to ask you to recharge funds into random local bank account. Something is very wrong too. Scam don’t just happen to elderly. It will happen to young people like us too. Ny case is still pending police investigation and i called the bank to report as fraud. Hopefully able to take some money back.
The person called me and he said I'm illegally sending a covid message using a phone number from China which didn't belong to me, he said the number is registered under my passport, so when i asked him what is my passport number he didn't know and he said they will shut down my phone service in sg.

Hi, would like to highlight to you scam calls apparently from India pretending to be Singtel rep. The scammer spoke really professionally and being a Singtel subscriber I almost fell for the scam, luckily they called me on my Starhub number and I suspected something was wrong and I told her off and she slammed down the phone.
Indian guy called to inform that my Singtel internet is experiencing some issues and having connectivity issues. I May i check with u on how shld / where should I report a scam call claiming that my Singtel internet has been compromised? inform him that this is ok, no worries and never mind. I then promptly hung up on him.
Someone by the name tan Siao Ying approached me in telegram informing that there is a online job opportunity. This account than pass my mobile contact to kai xuan (+65 8897 9080) who claims that she is an agent for ad tech innovation pte ltd. She then created an account to a portal (www.asiapacshop.com) and my task is to "process the order". For a start, the agent allowed me to use her account to process the order (ojt). There will be times when the system auto assigns special bonus commission which require me to transfer money into the portal to earn extra bonuses. When using her account, she will be the one who does the transfer. After i was done with her account, part of her commissions were credited into my account to kick start the order processing. They also promised that after all tasks were completed, whatever amount transferred in together with the commission (around $80-$150) earned will be returned. On the second day, i proceed with my "processing of order" but this time round, the amount required to be transferred in gets much more than the day before.

An Indian lady called me and said she's from amazon. She was in a noisy call center environment and said I placed an order for an ipad and wanted to confirm it with me. Then asked if i want to cancel or proceed. I said i want to cancel. She said ok and said i need to follow some steps to cancel and her manager will guide me thru. She said just don't give any personal or bank details. She then asked me to get ready a computer device.i said i can just use my mobile phone.then she asked what OS was I using, and i replied android.i found it weird so i asked what name is the purchase made under.she never answered me and directed me to her manager. Th manager is an Indian guy, i asked again for the name and he said that scammers likely created a fake account for this and asked me if my device is ready.i asked him to run thru the steps he wans me to do before i do it..He avoided that a few times and asked me to just go to the main page of my device and turn on speaker. Later he said need me to go to play store and then download an app called quick support. I told him that i wont download an app to cancel an order and asked them to send me an email or sms on this instead and hung up. The quick support app is a legit app that is used to gain remote access to devices.

Received a call saying "you have a court case, please press 9" After pressing 9, a person picked up asking for court number. Saying I am involved in a “Loke Choy Fong” court case. Then asked for name and fin number. (shared) I realised it was a scam.
Story Met this scammer via tinder who scammed me of via fake cryptocurrency investment (oriental wealth). I invested 100sgd initially and could withdraw with a profit. then he asked to invest 6k, which i did. then he asked me to invest another 30k which i sensed something amiss and i could not withdraw the 6k. after so many weeks, i have not heard back from the police on whether this guy is arrested or if they manage to get back the money i lost. this is a very common scam called pig butchering scam. 1) claims to be rich/business owner from china, stays in condo in orchard. His tinder location shows newton and less than 1km away from me (i stay near central). these scammers go to such areas just so that their tinder location can reflect location in central and make their "rich" story more believable. 2) ask for whatsapp etc. they keep changing their tinder picture with different men picture so after they ask for your contact, they simply unmatch you on tinder. 3) Asked to chat with you in chinese, citing they prefer to chat in chinese outside of work. 4) Profile picture typically looks nice with minimal description/random english quotations/chinese quotations, but some picture looks like they are local singapore as well. 5) they read your dating profile and will get you to reveal more about your interest, religion etc when chatting, assess your character and pretend to be someone your character would like. 6) for my case, the guy was smart because he asked to meet but at his house. as a female of course i said no. then i suggested meeting for a meal and he was dissing the choice of my restaurant - this is just the scammer tactic to avoid meeting face to face. Some suggestions based on my experience, other than what is stated above 1) check if the guy has instagram, other social media platform, linkedin. surely a normal person have some form or another of such accounts 2) if point 1 fails, or they dont add you, ask for the picture of the guy doing specific action (you dictate), or video call. tinder verified profile MAY not mean that the person is real. i read somewhere that the guy could just get his own photo verified and then change the photo (to a nicer looking guy) afterwards - but i cannot confirm this. 3) look out for fake looking profile, listing that he is a business owner, stays in an exclusive neighbourhood such as newton, orchard, novena, bukit timah, tanglin. especially if these areas are written in chinese in the dating app,

Called to my house telephone, addressed my last name correctly. Claimed to be Starhub, finding many extra devices in my house connected to wifi. Therefore was going to charge me higher, unless i help to identify unregistered devices around my house. Asked me to run "terminal" on my laptop. And to type in "netstat" on it. That's when i got suspicious, and hung up the call. I then called starhub and they verified they made no such calls made to me.
The scammer claimed to be an investigative officer from Singapore police force and say i was complained for moneylaundering and insisted on video-chatting me. when i ask which division he belongs to; he just insists he is from singapore police force; his english sounded very indian and calls from a USA number
Scammer made contact via IG and quickly asked/begged for WhatsApp contact, after which he started to message me day and night, showing concern, and that quickly advanced into professing his undying love. I was suspicious from an early stage because some things he said didn't gel, and his ig profile showed very little about him but contained a lot of photos not taken by him. He was also very hesitant to send me photos and enter into video call, giving some sob story about his ex-wife being killed in a car accident while they were on video call. After 2 weeks, he started to broach the subject of investing in cryptocurrency, and would sound unhappy or lecture me whenever i did not sound interested. Eventually, he disappeared into thin air, when I insisted I am not interested to learn.
Saw this easy packing job such as fold boxes or pack buttons. Contacted the number in facebook. The person shared videos on how to pack the items and the varies payment when you accomplished a task. If u finish 2 task u get reward $340. The catch is, you need to pay deposit of $100 or $140 vip. $100 only allow you lower pay out jobs and no choosing task. $140 is higher paid and you can choose and have priority to the job. Kept asking if i am able to accept making payment for deposit before he continues. Deposit will be refunded upon completion of 2 tasks. The moment i said not comfortable, he rudely told me to continue finding free jobs and block my number. The items that you pack are cheap- paper boxes, folding envelope, buttons, ziplock, beads. These are less than what you would have paid $100 minimum as deposit. They may probably deliver to you the goods and disappear without collecting your finished task. By then too late to realise you have been scammed. Which job requires one to make deposit first before starting?
They disguised as Shoppee marketing team. Asking you to pay for the purchase upfront and bank in payment to Mr Lim shen? ya?? UOb ACCT# 395393????. Once payment done to wait for to wait for payout.
I met this girl on facebook dating, who initially seemed legit to me as we chatted a lot and had quite a bit in common. she identified herself as a beautician working at mbs. on our second day of chat, she suddenly felt ready to meet and was agreeable to a date. she also asked if i was busy and could help her with some zalora task. i was not comfortable with the idea, so i rejected her at first and she just expressed slight disappointment. she said she has to complete the tasks in order to be able to go on the date with me the next day. I gave her a little benefit of doubt and tried to get her to explain to me what the zalora job entails, in which she explained in mandarin. she said she will help me with the payment the first time (to prove to me it is 'real') and subsequently, i can do the rest by myself in which i will earn some commissions. I sensed something fishy and decided to google search 'zalora tasks' and true enough, there were recounts of such scams in the past 1 year and there were a few people who had already been victims of such scams. i blocked this girl's contact after telling her i refused to help her with this. To everyone out there, please remain vigilant no matter which social app you are using. there are still many scammers like her trying to sweet talk their way through.
It so happened that i did receive WhatsApp call while at work FROM the number +92 342 0937130 where you will notice a MOM whatsapp DP on the CONTACT. Note the caller holds no information about you and will try to verify your vaccination status asking for your fin/nric and so. The moment I realized it was a foreign number, I disconnect the call.
Scammer called, (usually in heavy indian accent) said from “amazon”, he detected a $5,000 purchase on my account, but the product being sent to a hk address, not My address, can I confirm? So i confirmed no, its fraud. Then he Went on: “ok sir i can help you, I will send you AN OTP, When you receive it, let me know what is the number, its for me to confirm your identitY so i can help you.” I gave him nothing but frustration, then called him out as a scammer. He hung up straight away.
Well i was tempted by this ad on locanto that offer sexual services ($100/90 mins), I decided to book an appointment thru whatsapp to meet her. When i reached there, i contacted her and she told me that i would need to make a payment to prevent any police for checking. She asked me to pay me thru razer gold which i thought was weird at first and i was expecting the cash payment instead. I was naive to believe her "police-checking" story and fell for the it which i paid $100 to me. After the payment, she said someone will call me to verify that i am not with the police. After that, the guy that claimed to be the bodyguard contacted me and asked to pay a first time protection fee deposit ($1200) to protect from anything happening to the girl. They told me that the money will be returned after the whole thing. I found it was very suspicious and tried to drag the whole payment until i figured it out what was going on. After a while, both the girl and the guy keep pestering and calling me on why it taking so long. I told them that i didn't trust them and they started to threatening me with my family. After that, i just decided to block and reported on WhatsApp. I believe both of them are in the same room as i can hear another person talking which i assumed to be that guy. I hope others did not fall prey to these scams and do not allow lust to consume you!
Instagram acct was locked by the scammer and msgs was sent to my contacts asking people to join the investment
Multiple times I received calls from someone claiming to be Singtel from the number above (non sg). This time I listened what they wanted me to do and they wanted to connect to my Internet server claiming they need to remove some ip addresses that are connected to my network from overseas and are slowing down my Internet and stealing information. I would like to alert the public on this so that they don't get scammed.
Through a call a lady claiming she is from the technical dept having issues with my wifi, reported higher consumption in the past week. When asked what is my subscriber she couldn't answer and repeatedly answered twice she's from the technical dept. Forcing her into answering me, that's when she said she's from Starhub and Singtel but none of those are my wifi subscriber, asked if I was Natasha (not my name) and so she hung up the phone.
The number called and told me they are Starhub. I asked for their employee Id, they gave me the number 2411. she said her name as well. The purpose of the call: She wanted to alert me that there are high volume of internet being used through my starhub internet and that i need to tell them about how many devices are connected to my router. At this point, i stopped talking to them by telling them that they are suspicious and they ended the call.
1. Incoming caller id shows various phone number (82887996, 67729108, 88666764). One common sign: once I picked up the call, the caller on the other line takes a while to respond. As if they are not in local Singapore or there is lagging issue. 2. Very professional fluent English speaking callers, identifying himself/herself "as SingTel technical department. Good afternoon. How are you today? Greetings. We detected high usage, hacking risk etc etc. Can you see if your router is blinking light etc. " 3. Once I turn on my recorder and asked the caller to repeat, they will hang up immediately! 4. The 1st recording I did was 27 Jan 2022 from 67729108, the lady caller was slow to realise and the recording captured her voice. But she soon hung up the phone after a few seconds. 5. The 2nd recording I did was 9 Feb 2022 from 82887996. When i asked him to repeat, he immediately hang up. The recording playback captured static noise when the male caller was reading out his script. Smarter scammer this time. They muffled their own voices!
There was a guy named Alaina Chua in telegram who offered a part time job earning $280 per day. I was keen and wanna know n dig more info as nowadays scam is too much.. Then there is a lady named Isabella 80142628 whatsapp me who says she is an agent from Moni pte ltd. Then I asked her for more info and she told me it is to help their business increase exposure rate and credibility to increase their sales and data. she says i just need to do the clicking only. On 7th feb she asked me to register a new account at www.moni-m.com and use her account to do the clicking and earn her dividend 20% commission just to help her complete 50 orders. Actually i earned $83.20 first day and she ask me to click my own earning i made so i did transfer 3 payment to Goh Lin Hui 88561493 $46.77, $23.31, $69 to Customer service name called kenny 88549301 then i quickly submit to withdraw out. In less than 30min I received my money and the profit I made total is $231.51. However, the next day after i use her account for 50 order and she transfer about $10k and i made $330 then i have to click 30 order inorder to take back my earning, this round i transfer to this person name Daryl 88755612 the 1st recharge is $216.58 2nd recharge is $488 and then Posb rejected 3 times then i still manage to transfer out $488, 3rd recharge was $799.. the amount is getting bigger which was diff from yesterday. After that DBS called and alerted me that I'm in a job scam as many victims were scammed. Therefore I informed her that DBS blocked me so I asked her can you help me to transfer them first..she immediately said oh cannot cos this is your account blah blah blah.. she asked me to continue tml again and find my own fund myself to solve this n withdraw my money back.. Then on the same day I saw a woman named Lee 80115172 who earned $400 then I saw her send in a group chat that she received $6452 from POSB meaning she got back her profit including her money..i was like Hmm... I was a bit worry then i google scam alert that was told from my wife and i find out most of the story is related similar same as me.. they even have a group chat Issabella Team of 13 person chatting each other as per normal and sending those money they have earned and collected back from Moni pte ltd. They also send those food pictures similar to those other stories I read from job scams and I realised that I got scammed.
I got a call from the number: +13478085197 on my Whatsapp today. Man with a strong Indian accent said he was from the Singapore police and had contacted me stating that i had not updated my contact information. He asked me for my I/C number. I told him to tell me what police station so that I could go there to sort out matters in person. After I said that - he hung up the phone. so i think this is scam call. I just want to share it here so that others can be made aware of such scam calls.
I met David through ig. Within a few days he asked to move to telegram. We quickly became friends. Often, he would shower compliments. He was attentive and humorous and his story of coming to Singapore from china to do business seemed believable. Things took a turn when we started talking about crypto, a topic that he broached. I shared that i was new and he sent screenshots of a pledge mining pool. He said it was lucrative and i should consider trying. I was curious and asked for more information. When i told him i needed to do more research, he encouraged me, warning me to only use legitimate platforms Each day, he would persuade me to invest us$50-$100, to the point where i felt pressured and uncomfortable. Looking online, all that came up was a pledge mining scam video. Wanting to give him the benefit of the doubt, I told him I had reservations and even sent the link of the video I found. He seemed shocked and tried to assure me that he did research too. He also said that if his investment turned out to be a scam, he would sue, and made a joke about it. When I expressed more concern, he said it made our relationship weird and blamed me for not trusting him. We even got into an argument. I tried to change the topic and asked for more info. That’s when he sent me a link which tried to direct me to coinbase. I realised this was a scam and didnt click further. At this point, I spoke to some friends and they asked me proceed with caution. Coincidentally, I had other things happen that halted our conversation, but not before he sent more screenshots of new investments he had made. He told me he had decided to continue investing despite me previously sharing it could be a scam. He is still trying to engage me today but has since made his ig profile private
Scammer imitated a sg girl with photos of sg hdb in the back. Scammer offered an easy job with commission bonus for raising movie ratings. Looked sus cos of the "deposit" and "frozen" function. Played with their little game until i was asked for bank info, contact info and name. Obviously i asked if it was a scam. Scammer denied it was one. I searched online and found CNA articles of similar movie ticket scams and i questioned the scammer. Scammer gave up and I report and block the person. Please be wary of such scams!
I received a missed WhatsApp call from the number +65 9056 1079 this guy set a pic of Singapore police in WhatsApp DP, so I thought it's a genuine call from Singapore police. So I called again, He said 'You are in Singapore using an ATM card right, many people are misusing it, tell me which ATM you are using' , I said I won't, then he said ' turn on the video then you will trust me' and he started video calling me, I cut the call and blocked the contact. It's a scam call..

A person did Whatsapp video call today afternoon and claimed that he is calling from Singapore Police Force, showing the huge banner behind him. I first thought it genuine. But when he said my bank complained about not updating my IC num, it created a doubt. He said if I don show him my Ic, he will block my card and account. I underStood the whole story and asked him to do so and warned him if he does this kind of Scam calls again. But this was not enough, he had guts to call me back within 5 mins and said “I’ll catch you in 5 mins”. Be prepared. These calls are really frustrating and threatening. I am sure they were not operating from singapore. The accent was European and Ph num seems to be from Pakistan. Beware and ignore such phone calls!
I received a call, claiming to be from 'Singtel technical team', it detected unusual internet usage from foreign ip address.

Scammer called me pretending to be my cousin but dont say name but made you say yours. The problem is he describe a scenario similar to my real cousin situation having open new bizz and lost wallet and phone needing some help to pay off some vendor. one follow by another and another. I lost 20k in 2 TRANSACTIONS before getting suspicious. I could have just asked my actual cousin to verify! Please be alert!
Someone called saying they are from Singtel and said that my wifi was experiencing heavy use. They wanted me to run some command functions on my PC but I stopped before they could get me to install anything.
1) The caller attempted to contact via phone and explained that he's contracted by singtel to perform a check on internet connection, claiming that there is a severe security issue with unauthorised access by other users. Despite telling the caller that I use another internet service provider, they insisted that they're contracted by singtel for the service. The caller then requested to download anydesk to perform troubleshooting. While I didn't lose anything, I would like to remind users to be wary of this scam.
+6587961607 called and mentioned my name. Malaysian Chinese accent and told me to add his new mobile number into my contact list. Requested his name and he said we met few days ago and disappointed i did not recognize his voice. Asked him at which location we met but did not answer my question and instead, told me to recall of a slightly pump pump guy i met previously. Insisted that he gave his name to me or I would hang up. He replied saying that I would lose a friend. Blocked his number and added it into my contact list. Saw another number tied to the one above @ +92 307 2236994.
Female texted me on telegram offering job. Guy texted me on WhatsApp claiming able to earn 50-80dollars per day using his promo code. Website looks extremely fishy. Https://www.b-blueshift.com/index/index/home.html (Note: Do not click. Scam site). Pretty sure it is a scam, as the original website looks extremely different. Nothing was lost
+65 9424 83xx called me to warn me that 18, 19 users from overseas were using my internet connection. The person on the other line told me that they are from Singtel and need me to perform and verify some information on my laptop or mobile phone. at the same time asking more information about where i am located in singapore. which other telco am I using, other than Singtel. I needed to talk to someone and get this quickly across as the scammer (female) person direct me to another male senior technician from singtel (claimed) to dig out info from me but failed. Many will fall prey to such scare or threaten tactics used in these scams. The unbelievable thing is that the scammer I spoke with proudly admitted before hanging up my call that there are many ignorant people in Singapore willingly to give money to them as they simply believe their words.
i was first contacted by someone call michelle chia working for recruit express from telegram asking if i wanted a freelance job, i agreed and gave my contact details and after which, a woman call elise lee yee wen on whatsapp explaining that she's from moni pte ltd and offering me a marketing freelance job where i increase view rate of products just simply by clicking. i can earn $90/day and the task take about 2 hours to complete. i was told to register as an agent and sign up on the website (https://www.moni-c.com/index/index/home.html) i hop on the opportunity thinking there's nothing to lose yet and she also instruct me to help her complete her account on the daily basis which then i can receive 20% dividends on her account. at the start i have to complete 30 orders which is to click 30 times and then i can withdraw the money on the same day. the top up process is to paynow the amount of money to recharge on the website to various merchants and send screenshot to moni customer service via whatsapp. on the course of working for 3 days, i have transferred to about 4 different people namely goh jianhui, jovan wong, jiaming chee and kasthuri malik. I JOINED ON THE 19 JAN 2022 AND WORK TILL 21 JAN 2022. on the 2nd day, she ask me to top up and be a bronze member so that i can earn more and do more times on one single day. so i did and that is when i start to panic because i have to up close to $3000 in one shot in order to complete just 1 order. at first i did "earn" about $300+ for the first two days, it is on the 3rd when i was required to top up so much money that i do not have enough anymore and i try to plead her to help me and she refused. i knew then it was a scam and i lodged a police report the next day citing the incident. in total i lost $8000 as i transfer from my uob and dbs account all via paynow.
Last night a lady (Judy) messaged me on telegram asking whether I’m still interested in a job. I was curious so I told the woman I'm ok with them contacting me on WhatsApp (their request). The next day, a man (jack ng) Whatsapp me and told me about the "data job". Simple job that requires you to click on orders (so as to help the beneficiaries) it's to drive good star ratings for online goods etc. I felt that it's fishy because the commission ($50-$80) that takes roughly few seconds each to "press/click" is too good to be true. Next step is because they need to change the communication platform, no training, need you to log into "dubious" website (https://www.b-blueshift.com/index/user/login.html. Scam site. Do NOT CLICK) etc. I didn't even click as I’m afraid of phishing. I went online to google for scams like this and found this website so i decided to share my story here. Remember not to press the link guys! Always check the link carefully and go online to search for scams. Please do inform your friends and family of this job so that they won’t fall for it.

But finally she told me it was too late unable to invest. Next day, she said only $60,000 then can do the investment and we do last investment , will take back all our moNey. So I put in $20,000 more and she do the investment during the night . About an hour later she told me can do the withdrawal. When I do the withdrawal at the website , the customer told me my account is frozen and needed to top up 50% of my withdrawal amount of $69,772. This is when I realised it was a scam.
I got a text from 'sgpost' (no number) that I had a failed delivery attempt. i went to the website and it asked me to pay $2 for re-scheduling the delivery. i did. i put in the otp. after some time, it said payment failed. another otp was immediately sent to my phone when i generated it. it was so quick that i failed to see that a transaction of $3200 had already occurred and that uob (my credit card bank) had sent the usual text to call them if unauthorised. i put in the new otp and the same process happened again. but this time, i saw the unauthorised transaction oF usd2000 above the new otp generated. I called uob within 3 minutes. It was only during this phone call that i was informed of the earlier transaction i missed. my police report was filed immediately that night and within hours an officer was assigned to my case. i'm still trying to resolve these transactions with the bank.
Was called by a caller claiming to be from Singtel engineering department trying to report to me that they noticed reports coming back to singtel of unauthorised user log-ins onto my home based internet platform.

i got a message on telegram asking if i wanted a freelance job. no experiences required and the job is to handle social media accounts. then they refer me to another person on whatsapp. she introduced herself as she is from sourcesage company. i asked her what is the work scope and she said to optimize data that are required from the merchants on sourcesage. first she gave me her account and ask me to create an account on the sourcesage.live website. then i can learn through the process. after completed 30 orders on her account i have to submitting another 30 orders on the account i created then i can get my commision. I was being able to withdraw my first commision with the amount $50 from the website. then she asked me to do it again on her account by SUBMITTING/optimizing 50 orders. i done it again so i need to do it on my account in order to withdraw back the commision and my money but this time the triple commision was required me to put in bigger amount and i can't afford that. i chatted to her and ask for help. she did not help me and said it is my own responsibility since other members also do it by themselves. that moment i found out that is a scam.

The guy robert lee said to take a 20k i will need to take a small test loan of $500, repay in 5 days, and pay back $900.. with this scheme, i wlll be granted to waive off 10% admin charge of 20k.

End up the company staff said there are many complaints regard this guy robert lee. Today he sms me and i told him i want to clear the loan today $900. He give me an uob current account and i transferred $900 back to him.

I made a police report after that.
I received a call from +6563916100. They said immigration officer asked my passport details and fin number. They got my details. But the officer wanted my banking information details. I hung up knowing that government officials will NOT ask for such details.
On 17th Jan 8:41AM, I received an email from SINGAPORE POST CO.LTD stating the following "failed delivery attempt for parcel #942167". please click on the button below and confirm the shipping fee (5SGD) to complete the delivery attempt successfully'. when i clicked on the "confirm" button it led me to a page that requested me to fill in all my credit card details. The email address looked wrong and i had my doubts if the email was a genuine email from singpost. I called up singpost immediately to check and the officer told me that the id number provided in the email was incorrect and confirmed that it was a phishing email. Sharing with you guys here to alert you to this phishing scam!
I received this this link "biztalentplus.com" that directed me to a registration page to carry out a new job. After i have registered with my details, i Received a whatsapp text from +65 81568293, giving me more informations and offering this job to me. she stated that we do not required money from you, so i thought is actually not a scam. After i have register an account on ecommerce, she asked me to use her account to do the "clicking stuff" unitl 60 tasks are done , when it requires top-up, ( balance insufficient), she top up using her account. on 15/1/2022, i actually earn $124. However, the next day, the top up is getting too high and the so called triple commission is going from $199 to $540. I do not have sufficient money in my bank account to continue with the top up. so I messaged her and asked for help. she'll just encourage me to keep going with the money and i actually wanted to transfer another $790. Luckily, DBS blocked the transaction and lock my account. However, The scammer ( +65 88275714), told me that the money is already top up for me. So i continue with the task, however, after a few tasks , I was required to top up again and is $1160 this time. so i went to ask for help. I realised it was a scam later on.
Scammer can impersonate anyone to cheat and can be your "friend" too. i believe that this scam has re-emerged. +6584123746 this number call me twice, first call i picked up, no sound. I hung up. The same number called again, i pick up again, and this strong malaysian chinese accent guy talk to me, and told me, "hello , this is my new singapore number 84123746, please remember" i was like "ok"? Then could you tell me who you are first? so that i'm able to update my contact right, he said, " we just meet up recently you forget? from this point i already confirm what he said was fake why he need to hide himself if he is legit? 2nd he is waiting for me to give him a name so that he can carry on his scamming. but too bad i dont have any malaysian friend. i play along with him, i ask him, ok at least you can tell me what your old number? so that i am able to update my contact? he say will whatapp me his old contact for me to update, till now he did not whatapp me anything. before he hang up he say later i whatapp you my old number you update this new number your contact, we can go yishun northpoint for a meal as his friend open a new foodstall there. and he hang up. 3 day later my colleague told me he was scam of 400 dollar. due to this same Modus operandi (MO) he told me he transferred of 400 to this unknown guy he say his new stall need to pay his food supplier first as he just open a new stall. my colleague report this to police already. Same accent that sounded like Malaysian, same tactic, to use open new stall as reason to transfer money to supplier. Such a coincidence. Lastly, i would like to use this platform to inform all people with foreign friend. do check the person identity first, ask a secret question that you and your foreign friend will know challenge the caller first. if not, hold the call and immediately your foreign friend if he really change number. before continuing the conversation.Editor's Note: Please verify the request by contacting your actual friend through a number or email that you already know to check.
On a Saturday noon, I was overseas and got a random call By +1 (850) 631-3130 using Whatsapp with a DBS LOGO thumbnail. The man said He's calling from DBS because I haven't update NRIC number to my bank account. He needs my NRIC number to validate my account, or it would be locked for 6 months. I asked him if this can be done using app. He answered no, claimed that the phone call is under record and kept urging me to provide My G-starting NRIC number. I Gave HIM my NRIC number, he then Addressed me by full name and asked me to provide card info to him. I tried to stall for time, while he is quite patient, I eventually gave Him my card Info. THen He asked me to provide him the OTP. Message I Got "ONline Transaction of PKR9,000 at cheetay logistics PVT LTD." (equivalent ~70 SGD). I hung the phone and the same number tried calling me for three times.
It started on 21 December 2021. I met this girl named "Biang" on TanTan dating app. We chatted a while on the app before exchanging number to continue on WhatsApp. She introduced herself as "ZhongYing 钟颖". Her number is +60 11-6441 6088. We chatted for a few days to understand each other until one day she asked me if I'm interested to invest. She promised me she will guide me along and very confident every transaction will be successful. She kept on persuading me and send me a link to install the app. It's a APK file, app named "KRX". The app uses USD only and in order to deposit you will need to contact customer service via WhatsApp. Deposit via account number or paynow. KRX number is +852 5535 2443. After downloading the app, I created an account. She told me to deposit US $100 equivalent to SG $135 to give it a try. She began persuading me to deposit US $1000/SG $1350. Since I did "earn", I decided to be greedy and deposit SG $1350. She told me she willing to "lend" me US $6000, so I took it. She also told me to message her my KRX account number so she can transfer the US $6000 to me. At this point, I trusted her completely as all the transactions she guided me were successful. I began to deposit more and more money. On the day of Christmas, I decided to withdraw all my money out and return her US $6000 equivalent to SG $8100 as we agree on it. I questioned her the withdrawal procedure and she answered me if my account is less than US $20000, you will need to contact customer service and if US $20000 or more, it can be done by yourself on the app. I contacted the customer service for withdrawal as my account only have around US $15000/over SG $20000. Customer service text me saying it is required to pay the cross border fee, 20% of the total sum and is fully refundable after the withdrawal completes. She started pestering me to return her US $6000 she lend me or else she will lodge a report on the app and make a police report. I got scared and paid the 20% cross border fee so that I could get all my money back and return her. Customer service message me saying it takes about 30 minutes to process. About 15 minutes later, I received a message from customer service saying a user report me, therefore withdrawal process has stopped. At this point, I know it is all a scam and make a police report. Later that day she message me to return her money but I ignored her. In total I lost $12643 in 3 days. From investment to nightmare. WORST CHRISTMAS EVER. ⚠️ If you are a victim of a scam, please DO NOT attempt to be a scammer or money mule in order to recover back your losses ⚠️
I was contacted by a random person from telegram asking if I want to make 150-300 a day working from home. I joined a few job ads group so I thought they randomly messaged us. So I ask for details and soon after a person on WhatsApp message me and invited me to a group. Everyone in there was very friendly and helpful. About 7-8 of them. Some even pumped me and help me along. 1 of them act as new comer and pm me as well. Share me screens and their journey(inciting me to do the same) it is said that there's a job like "online ticketing tasks" (basically purchase movie tickets and earn comms. So they asked me to register an account from this website jtxszp.com and after that there's a free $100 inside for you to "start" purchasing movie tickets and boost the ratings etc. (you need to complete 35 tasks to withdraw your money) to earn comms. So I earned $10 from 35tasks and it was able to withdraw that "$10" comms. (so basically they roped you in by giving you $10 first.) And soon that $10 earned them $491 in return. So for the 2nd time, there is no more $100 free. So I have to top my own $100 and the story begins. It says you get a premium ticket (no.17 ticket) but you need another $391 to unlock. So I need top up and on the ticket no.21, I got another 'premium' ticket and asked me to top another $1100+. That is when I got suspicious and stopped deposit and went to ask them. The whole group ended up blocking me when I asked them to assist me.
I was approached by a girl on telegram who wanted to hire me for a job. She then introduced me to another dude who introduced me to this click for commissions job on the taiger platform. it seemed legitimate at first as there was a company uen number and address. They ran through the whole clicking process, and while i was skeptical of the requirement to deposit money, they assured me by showing me the withdrawal process and actually money to my bank account. I then decided to continue on and try the job, but limiting my first top up to $100. However, as i went along, they required more top ups. I decided to top up so i can get back my original $100. It escalated to the point where i had deposit a total of $3000. I stopped there and asked the company customer service what i can do, and was informed if i could not complete the clicking assignments within 3 days, I would get sued. At this point, i decided to do a google search to see what i had brought myself into, and found out via scamalert.sg that i may have fallen for a jobs scam. I lodged a police report thereafter based on advice on scamalert.sg.
I was waiting for my medicine to be couriered to me by NUH. Then I received a message from "SingPost". The message informed me that a redelivery was needed and I needed to pay $2++. Thinking it was the real SingPost, I clicked on the link which sent to a page. On the top right hand of this page, there was an Apple pay logo. Then I provided the information as requested. Then a UOB notification came in informing me that there was a $4000+ transaction made on my credit card. That's when I realised that I fell prey to a phishing scam. A police report was made and I'm trying to resolve the issue with the bank.
A buyer named luyang (USERNAME:TANGLUYANG) contacted me on carousell to buy my secondhand clothes ( which cost only $12). Initially, she was asking for some extra information about the clothes and I asked to meetup in person to make the deal. I stay in the east and she stays in the west , so i asked to compromise and told her i could meet around town area. This was when she offered to get a courier service herself to get the items from my house to deliver them to her house. She asked me for my house address, mobile phone number and email address so she could ask the courier to get the items from me. I did not have any second thoughts and gave all my information to her. Then, the nightmare began; She told me that she would transfer $12 to me through PAYNOW with caroupay. I have heard it’s a new in-app feature but have never used it before so I do not know how it works. She sent me multiple screenshots of the payment made to my mobile phone number on PAYNOW and they looked legit. I then received an email on my gmail account with the title: “Caroupay confirmation” and the sender address was [buyandsale.carousell@gmail.com]. The content in the email was: Dear Customer, A payment has been made to your paynow no. from luyang through caroupay, kindly complete your login on our carousell website for your funds to be added to your paynow account. Please paste the URL below to your browser: confirmation-proceeds.herokuapp.com [NOTE: Fake website. Do NOT click] At this point, I somehow knew something was wrong and hesitated to click into the link. However, like people said :curiosity killed the cat. I clicked into the website to see what is going on, and not to my surprise, it was a DBS homepage (with the strange URL above) and it prompt me to enter my ibanking id and password. I closed the webpage immediately and confronted the buyer. She insisted that nothing was wrong and her payment did not get transferred to my account successfully and kept asking me to login to the link sent to my email to get her payment. This was when I blocked her and reported her account to carousell. Even though I did not lose any money in this scamming incident, but I did share personal information such as my home address. I hope my story acts as a warning for those who are dealing with strange buyers like this on any online platforms and please don’t be like me, who clicked into a suspicious URL link sent to your email.
I got contacted by someone on Telegram about a job offer and they moved to whatsapp and told me that when i put in money into the account and help to optimize parcels i'll get COMMISSION and the first few times I did receive the money, but after that they asked for more &amp; more money. Eventually, i stopped giving when I lost 3k.
I received this Telegram message from a "Bonnie" and she asked if I’m interested in their part-time job that I can do on my leisure time like weekday night or weekend. As long as I’m over 19 years old. Following day, this lady named Gina contacted me on Telegram and WhatsApp, shared a bit of the job and led me to the website: https://www.x-affise.life/index/my/index.html (NOTE: Do NOT click) and asked me to use her account for trial. It was an easy job, just clicked traffic data and completed 50 missions and I earned $109 commission. Registered and tried myself with her guidance, first day (10 Jan 2022) during the mission which required 3 top ups (to recharge/renew) with my own cash total $84, after I completed 50 missions then I could withdraw and earn $145 commission. This was just by clicking “Create Traffic date” and mostly household appliances, gadgets or furniture sales. On 2nd day job, I completed 50 missions on Gina’s account and earned $400+ commission and thereafter this was credited my account. She told me to proceed to complete my 50 missions. During the mission, sometime my amount always became negative which it required to top up (to recharge/renew) and I had topped up total 9 times total $65,692. At 41/50 missions, it required to top up $37,777 if I wanted to complete the mission. This was when I felt fishy and got scammed.
Received a call from a lady. She mentioned that my SingTel router is having issues (My case was StarHub). More than 10-20 people are connected using my router and they are trying to perform illegal activities. I played along. next, she asked if i have a mac or windows laptop. SHe transferred the call to another person MICHAEL (indian/pakistani/bangla voice). he asked me to run netstat command on mac terminal. He tried to sound geek but he failed miserably. next he asked me to install team viewer to fix the problem. At that moment, i asked him to verify his identity (already 13 mins have passed and i wanted to disconnect). He tried but couldn't convince and disconnected the call
Few days ago, received a msg on messenger and asked if I want to look for a own time own target job. Her name Bonnie. Then a guy name UNCLE CHUA contacted me on WhatsApp and lead me to this website : https://www.taiger.live/ and ask me use his account for trial. Tried and made a commission of $100 plus after 40missions completed. Registered and tried myself, 3 days ago, made a commission of $33/- after 40 missions, just click boosting will do. Mostly household appliances or furniture sale, 2nd day tried again but need put in at least $500 to recharge/renew mission and after clicking 23/40, my available amt becomes negative and asked to pay more money based on the neg. .. just over few hrs I lost 8K.
Singtel Technical Department tellling me my house internet have some errors that "popped up" and suspected that other users are hijacking my internet connection. I asked her how she knew so much information she keep repeating same questions. Lady very strong Indian accent. And also she is using a local handphone number. I asked her why she not using landline line official Singtel number? She repeated again that she was from the abovementioned dept and that my internet got issues. I hung up.
I was contacted on telegram by adeline asking if i was looking for a part-time job which is flexible and can do from home, and when i responded ok, she referred me to kai xuan, "agent of valtech", who contacted me on whatsapp to see if i'm interested to know more. Upon finding out the job description, it seems too suspicious to be true. She introduced me to this website "www.myvaltech.com" where i can "submit orders" and earn commission. How this works: 1) create an account under her referral, 2) give her my referral for her to sign me up under her, 3) help her account to grab 50 orders first which earn my account earn 20% commissions 4) to complete 50 orders, halfway through you will get a negative balance, because of "high value orders" which gives "triple commission" so you need to top up by contacting the customer service +65 8804 6658 on WhatsApp, very unprofessional. She makes you believe that you don't have to fork out any money while she does the fund transfer and sends you the screenshot and ask you to forward to the customer service. Why couldn't she do it herself? It is to show you that this "process" is legit. I read another scam alert that subsequently they will ask you to use the 20% comms deposited to your account to go to your account and finish 40 orders before you can withdraw the principal and commissions money. So i stopped at 4) as I felt suspicious throughout and did not want to provide any further personal details or money. I believe this scam works by locking your money away, lets you withdraw some commission and the principal, but then afterwards the order amount gets large enough that you have to keep topping up.. $1000+...$10,000+... And so on. Then maybe one day, you cannot withdraw. Red flags: 1) from the website, it claimed to be under "valtech", but the logo quality is obviously low and they just replace the company name all the time (there was a similar scam using ey's name, today it's valtech, tomorrow maybe it's apple...) 2) the money is too good to be true. $1-$30 commission per order clicked. Each click takes like 5 seconds.3) why would company's introduction not mention anything, uses colored font with multiple icons etc. Totally low level ui design that is randomly put together 4) the english used by the website and customer service is totally unprofessional. If you want extra income, find a proper side income by starting your own small home business, do grab, courier delivery, etc. Don't trust in such systems. Don't waste your time on easy money. Be wary, if you need to top up with your own cash. Nothing comes easy, especially money.
I was approached via telegram by a person with a profile picture of a pretty girl. she had an urgent job titled "movie box office assistant" or something of the sort. no experience required, training provided. Sherepeatedly asked me to confirm two things. 1. am I over the age of 18. 2. do i have a singapore bank account. I said yes to both, 3 times. she later passed me over to her "client" to contact me over whatsapp about the job scope. Whatsapp scammer was also a "pretty girl". She told me the job was to boost ticket sales for movies, and i would get a commision per ticket sold. she told me to register an account on this website. https://usahuamei.com/ i did, with my phone number. (Scammer already had this, anyway) I had a "Bonus" $100 to process the first 35 tickets for free.subsequent tickets would require a top-up of $100 dollars for 35 tickets. You then withdraw commissions into your bank account. Don't get scammed, my fellow residents!
Connected with ‘Hayden’ (Taiwanese who has worked in HK before and is working in SG now) on the Hinge app in early Dec. We moved to Telegram on the same day and he deleted his profile the next day (RF). We talked on Telegram for 2 weeks, in English and Chinese, before he introduced me to the fake/spoofed crypto trading website. I brought up the topic of meeting physically and/or video call but he would declined by saying that he wants to take it slow/changed the topic(RF). I caught him using fake photos(catfish!) and info since his words often didn’t match his Hinge profile (RF). He admitted it and told me he has trust issues with people because of his broken family and experiences and I was dumb to accept it for that hit my sore spot. We temporarily ended the convo in Week 3, but he still Telegram me a few days later to ‘invest’ again. I trusted his “investment advice” because of his financially savvy image portrayed during our investment discussion. Some other Red Flags(RF) about the platform: 1) Weird weblinks (ending with .xyz) that was changed every few days. One of them even triggered Chrome to show that it is a phishing website. 2) The mobile app by “Oriental Wealth”, a fake company with fake logo. User interface quite suspicious with broken English and invalid webpages(e.g. user agreement page). 3) Informed by “Customer Service” (CS) on Whatsapp(HK#) to transfer money to some personal bank accounts (most likely job scam victims), which changed whenever I deposited into the “trading account”. 4) Platform has options to ‘invest’ in 60s(min.$100HKD), 120s($1000HKD) and 12hrs settings. Longer period need more capital($) and can generate more ‘profit’(Online betting!!!) 5) He will ‘analyse’ the BTC chart and calculate the amount($) for me to key in into the website/app (buy long/short) for each ‘trade’, based on his special algorithm. I started with $500SGD and $2000SGD with the 60s setting for the first 2 tries and got back the capital with the ‘profits’ in my bank account by the next day. I pumped in $4kSGD next and ‘traded’ a few rounds and stopped when he said the “market was volatile”. Those few rounds didn’t “meet the minimum transaction volume” and they didn’t approve my withdrawal request. I told him about it, and he persuaded met to try the 120s option to get more profit. Since he will “cover” the additional $6kSGD by informing the CS that he topped up the “trading ID”, I relented. This time, the profits ballooned to around $30kSGD. I checked with CS a few days later when the money wasn’t in and they directed me to ‘service department”, whom informed me that my account was frozen due to the large foreign transaction and need to pay 15% of the withdrawal amount in 10 days or forfeit that $(profit+capital)(RF). I checked online (scamalert website etc) and finally accepted that I’ve been scammed. So, please don’t be greedy and do your research first!!!

Job scams. The name is "Crayon". They changed the website address almost everyday, even today they change twice: from www.h-crayon.life to www.b-crayon.com. It began with this site: www.best-crayon.com, and then to www.h-crayon.com. Beware of job offers that promises easy money and never pay to secure a job.

I rechecked the website and it looks different so I researched and confirmed it was just a scam.

Indian accent man called my mobile and claimed he is from singtel. detected suspicious connection using my modem. Asked me To go to modem and see what lights is turned on. I played along.

I was approached on telegram for a full-time / part-time job position. After showing interest, it was made known to me that I needed to be 18 and above and have a local singapore bank account. I tried to find out why there were such requirements but the "recruiter" only mentioned that it was for salary crediting purposes, and promptly redirected me to whatsapp to communicate with their "client". I was then given the job description and a link to sign up for their platform. please refer to uploaded screenshot. the web app itself looked extremely shoddy and poorly made, and i was particularly alarmed by the fact that I was supposed to be working for "wpp" yet their whatsapp business account profile picture stated "wwp". that's about all that happened as I then told the contact that I would not continue with this fishy commission based whatever nonsense. I did not lose anything as I was wary the from the start and did not provide any information. I played along as they already had my mobile number and already knew my name which was publicly available on telegram and whatsapp.
I was befriended by a Chinese lady by the name of Jenny through an online app. Her number is 8916 5091 After conversing for a couple of days, I was introduced to an online investment "game" where instant returns were promised. Out of boredom and curiosity, I decided to play along. The website for the game is ui2c.xyz (not sure if it changes. Do not click). There are several "games" people can play as an investment and the initial deposit is low. There is a live help centre/customer service officers where people have to contact in order to load their accounts. All of which is operated in Mandarin. After contacting the help centre, we are provided with a bank account (not sure if it changes but this time was standard Chartered) where money can be deposited to load the account. Subsequently, after playing the "game" the players get to withdraw their earnings and it is deposited back using the same account. I am luckY i have not been monetarily affected and have since stopped contact with the scammer. Scams are rampant these days so please be careful when conversing with people online
All thanks to this platform! Similar to most of the cases i saw over here, i received a telegram message by this lady called bonnie. the first time she texted me i didnt reply cause i find it weird as there's no details of her since i was guessing she's a recruiter. then, she double text me about sharing the information with me, and i asked her how she get my contact and who is she. she claimed that she is from recruitment agency and my data is in their database, i then allow her to go ahead with the sharing since i was really looking for a job and i do go through recruitment agencies. after that this guy called jasper (+65 89154538) with a dp looking like some china scammer (for real) whatsapp me. many years ago had many china scammer pretending to be job recruiter and hunt for students who wants to work from home, and his dp really makes me suspect him. so i questioned him a lot regarding the company, the pay and how does it work, do i have to pay to start etc... and he kept assuring me i do not need to find new comers but it clearly seems like i need to because he provided me with a link with invitation code. Then i immediately turn to google and search about it until i saw this website with the stories similar to mine. i didn't proceed anymore and blocked both bonnie and this jasper. Please keep a lookout! i didn't join them or sign up at all so not sure about the steps after that, but i saw other stories mentioning it. alert given, do not fall for it.
My encounter is similar to the one reported here. Someone name 'Karen' contacted me on telegram and later refer me to another 'Gladys' on WhatsApp. She said just need to help 'boost' 40 times and I will receive 25% of the commission, after this is completed we can do more missions afterwards to earn more commissions. I did not continue to the stage where they asked me to top up money from my own wallet, therefore I am only 99% sure it is a scam. Do not trust those these easy jobs offering great money.
I received a call claiming that they are from singtel and that there are unknown devices hooking up to my internet. they first asked that how many blinking/solid lights there are on the modem. next, they asked that i use press 'windows+r' to run the command prompt (CMD). afterwhich, they asked that i run netstat, showing proof that there are 'foreign devices' hooked onto my internet and warned that if anything happened through these devices, i will be held legally liable. they then asked and reconfirmed that i am the one who pays the bill of the internet and whether i am using a work or home laptop. then they asked me to run iexplore gg.gg. As i was suspicious, i was googling what they asked me to run in the command prompt before i click enter. having realised that they are trying to take over my computer, i call them out. The caller cursed, and i promptly ended the call. No money was lost.
Received sms saying issues with parcel delivery. The link provided brings to a Web page that appears to be designed to look like singpost page. Asking for delivery address, credit card details. The url of the page is not singpost domain.
This person by the name of Kai Li messaged me in telegram regarding a remote job offer. Initially, I did not suspect as I am on a job hunt. She said she is from a recruitment agency and already had my personal information. Naturally, I agreed to let her send me the job descriptions via WhatsApp. Minutes later, Zi Ming (+65 8902 2151) contacted me and offered to walkthrough step-by-step on a web traffic-driving platform called swell. The website was poorly made and both representatives had bad English, that raised the red flag for me immediately. I came to check on scam alert before proceeding and realised many other reported cases shared the same outline. I stopped immediately thus no losses was incurred. You can refer to other stories here to see how they carry on with the scam. *words of advice: When you receive unsolicited job offers, do not commit to it by giving money or link any bank card to the app or website before giving a search here
1. I was approached by an 'agent' claming that i would be able to earn quick and easy money by boosting view counts of items for websites on 29 dec 2021. The website used by the scammers was under a company called meiro. They keep changing the website logins to different domains such as: a. Www.bestmeiro.com b. Www.y-meiro.com c. Www.b-bestmeiro.com they claim that the changing of websites was to ensure that their webpage is secure and safe. After their pestering, I decided to sign up for an account by using another scammer's phone number (offering loans) and was able to successfully sign up for an account. After which, the scammer offered to let me use his accounts to boost missions, under the disguise of getting me familiar with the platform. I followed his instructions in performing the necessary until it requires a monetary top up in the system. The system prompted that i had hit a package mission which would require the monetary top up, according to the scammers once the package mission is completed. The user would be untitled entitled 3% commission. Knowing that it’s definitely a scam, I continued playing along with the scammer and requested for him to perform the necessary. While still logged in his account, I changed his passwords in the system, hoping to render his account useless. Till date, he has yet to confront me on the matter. After the trial on his account, it was my turn to boost missions in my own account. Apparently, my account was linked to his account and i would be receiving 25 % of the commission he receives. I was told to check on my account to verify if the money was reflected inside and i would be able to start boosting my missions. Eventually, I am stuck at a point where by i would need to top up money due to being 'lucky' in getting a package mission. This would require me to speak to their customer service, for me to top up the funds.I am sharing my encounter here to warn others of this scam.
I was contacted on Telegram if i would like a part time job. i said yes.Later i was contacted in whatsapp job explained to mE. all i need to do is boost merchants data 40 times. so they though me how to do it. seems easy. you just top up money and boost.and true enough i transferred 4k and made 500, Seems easy enough. someone in the chat group suggested i shld top up 3k to start(pls note nobody in the chat group is there to help you) so i started with 3k , as you progress thru your missions the sum gets higher and higher.impossible for anyone to finish. You would have needed abt 500k to finish. so everyone anyone offering you jobs to boost customer data. pls avoid!!!!!!! BTW, I lost more than $300k, so sharing my story here so that no one will become a victim.
The caller was a lady. She sounds like an Indian based on her voice. She called for 37 seconds. She stated that she was from SingTel and upon query, she shared that she received my contact as I subscribed to an internet service with them. I do not have an internet subscription with SingTel. I did not confirm that I did not have an internet subscription with SingTel. When I asked again how she managed to get my number, she ended the call.
I was contacted on Telegram by someone called Emily. She referred me to her client called nic who claimed that he’s from “Outbrain”. He asked me to log in to a site with the “Outbrain” logo and complete a set of 38 tasks using his acct to earn commission. He topped up $2k to his account 2x bec it’s a bonus task and we need to recharge the acct to earn. Top up amt can be withdrawn. At the end of the 38 tasks, he earned $453 in commission and I could take a 24% cut. To withdraw, I needed to complete 38 tasks in my own acct and top up money in the process. Please beware. I knew it was too good to be true coz everything abt it was so stupid and senseless so i decided to waste his time. Blocked him on WhatsApp.
I received a Telegram message offering a job. How it works is the same as those being shared here. However, the URL that the company used this time is www.best-crayo?.com.

I receive a text via telegram from jasmine on 21st Dec 2021, Randstad Singapore Recruitment AGENCY. I didn't read properly the introduction of the scammer. I even ask her to share the job detail. This is how i was being scammer. I even ask is this illegal before i do any transferred. I wasn't in a clear mind when the scammer say of course and she gave me the co. Name UEN and the website looks so nice. But sadly that i did not notice, why there is job that needs to top up $ before working. I did not even suspect that it was a scam. And this is how I'm trap and lost a big sum of money $3894.92. Beware of these scammers as they are getting smarter and more creative! Company NAME and address:Platform : MEIRO Our Program website : MEIRO (https://www.meiro.io/) Singapore address ：36 Carpenter St, SINGAPORE POSTAL 059915 UEN ID 201716898D Website address changes every 3-4 days to avoid suspicion
So this person call Alice contacted me in Telegram saying that they are hired new project personnel then after that she sent me an offer for the pay of part-time and full time and they told me there is no money game involved and she direct me to her college, linda/jia en. After register as per request (my fault of not checking whether is it a scam), she gives me a brief intro saying that they are working with admitad affiliate platform to increase data traffic, bring good rating and words of mouth. Www.myadmitad.com invitation code: xtej4q (please do not click in!!!!!!!!!!!!!) She say we can earn 30% commission from her account first after running 45 then i used that to run my own account. Basically, I just need to create traffic and I need to recharge at the customer service (WhatsApp: +65 8931 9941) when there is package data (which will lead to insufficient funds) on 27/12/2021, I deposit to chia Soh min (phone no: 88494382) act: 55740503?? (cob), I manage to get a profit of $186. I thought the second day I would also earn about this amount. But I didn't expect the amount to get bigger and bigger and I end up depositing about 2100 sad to teo yan yan (phone no:89141718) account: 7693792??? (uob bank) on the second day (28/12/2021). I contacted my agent (linda) as I’m not able to deposit anymore and what she recommend me is to complete the data. Even if I approach customer service the system is still asking me to finish the order by deposit 2400 (within 8h) so that I can take all the money back, or else my account will be frozen for 180 days before I can take back my deposit (this is what the customer service say). After cooling down and telling my parent, I think I’m being scammed and decided to stop. If this system is real, I should be able to get back my deposit amount after 180 days. (well its alr passed 8 hours form 28/12/2021 2.47 pm until now 29/12/2021 3.39 am my order haven't been frozen lol) (well, I cant access the webpage anymore on 30/12/2021) Please be aware if you are in this situation, they might add u into a grp chat and there will be people sharing that they are able to deposit the money back which in turn, makes you think that maybe you can take your money back. Even if you approach them, they would tell you that they did this for weeks alr and they are getting the money back. After thinking through, i have make a police report and contact the bank. It’s better to report than keeping silent.
I was informed that it is data entry work from home . Can be done anytime using handphone or laptop. I was given a website to log into and register. I had to click on create data. It showed that data was created and commission given. Then i was asked to top up money as it was not enough to continue. At first it was $50.00. Then, it slowly rose til the point that I had to complete 45 transactions. As I found something fishy, I stopped. The next day, the website became unavailable. I whatsapped Jessye at 85780784 regarding the money lost but was told that as i did not complete 45 transactions, so I couldn't withdraw the money.
A person name Chariotte Soo approached me on telegram and asking if I interested in a part time job.

Contacted by an Alice chong from Job Asia Consultancy - employment agency reg is sg. purportedly also offering free lance job to boost marketing for companies using customer data platform/ claims to offer 1% commission for boosting customers awareness" but when asked how this is done it is unclear and confusing. the company they claim to be their principal is meiro. they provided a link https://www.z-meiro.com/index/user/register (Note: Scam website. Do NOT click) - Got victims to register and set up own account offering to "pre-fund" up to 25% of his earnings to you (ie. free $). this got me suspicious - no stranger give u $ foC. Found out next that to earn yr commission u need to ensure your account is "boosting" enough - whatever that means was nvr clear,. but I suspect it means u may end up having to fund or buy stuff to ensure account is funded. its probably similar to ponzie scheme. furthermore a check found that this company registered in SG with has an address at a rented house in holland v. area .also all contact numbers from scammers are blocked or not working when trying to call. Beware.

I then questioned why his contact number was different from the night before. he then quickly said he will whatsapp me and he hung up.

A lady by name of Linda aka Tiktok msg me about a part time job offer in the afternoon. When I responded, It did not give job details at that time but says will put me into a groupchat. There's a group leader who will provide the job details that same night. My Whatsapp would buzz almost the whole hour from 10pm with others in the chat who would post that they have received their commission. It makes me think they are legit because i will see others making money. This is how they lure me. Then there's another person called dispatcher who will assign the task. I followed the steps despite suspecting it could be a scam. After I followed their steps, I received the commission into my account. This led me to think they were real. I would sincerely like to thank a guy named cedric because he tried to contact me thereafter and told me not to fall for it further. I must remind myself not to be greedy or gullible in future. Though I did not lose money, I have disclosed my bank information to them.
Our helper responded to sms by a Harry Koh dated 4 dec, advertising for a personal loan. Upon clicking the link, there was another sms offering a loan. She was asked first to pay a registration fee of $400 to be transmitted to uob 658-371082-2. Then, she was asked to sign a loan agreement under "365 credit solutions", which is a real company whose identity and forms the scammer stole, and to transfer another $400 to activate the account. Feeling something is wrong, she wanted to cancel the loan application and was told to pay $1000 cancellation fees. She came to us for help, and when we called the scammer harry koh, he threatened us that he was a loanshark. We then lodged a police report and called the company "365 credit solutions" who informed us that they have received a few complaints on this. We also called UOB to notify them of this fraudulent account.

It all start on 19th Dec 2021 when i received a telegram message from a recruiter named, mandy from “Recruitfirst”. She told me about wfh job with flexible working hours. She took my details (name, age, contact, job experience, Singapore bank) to send it over to the “in-charge”. Few mins later i received a WhatsApp text from “Olivia” who guided me throughout the “commission based job”. I tried it the next day, i got to complete all the missions and withdrew my money as well as the commissions. It all went well till 21st Dec 2021, I tried it for the second time. The “bonus mission” amount got higher and it appears again once i settled the previous ones after I recharged the account. That’s when i realised i was scammed. “Olivia” was of no help and kept on repeating the same phrase “ask from your family and friends. Few more missions to complete and withdraw all your money. Try your best!”. She even bother offered to give me $500 but i denied it. I’ve lost $6,920.10 in a day. My pockets are empty. I rushed down to the police station and filed a report. I don’t even have the hope of getting my money back.
This guy come to add me on Instagram. He act super friendly and introduce himself from China Wuhan but currently work in Hong Kong. Then he asked for my whatsapp to continue chat to know each other well. One day after, he said that he found the right life partner that is me. And would like to have future with me. Every morning noon night, he keep on text me to find out how am I. To make me feel like he is good and trusted guy. Then he ask me about the view of investment .I said I didn't know more abt investment. Then he introduced me to chinese platform http://CArU.duanurl.xyz/IVfpzKz? (Note: Scam website.

Then i got the gift money plus winning amount about 140 dollar and it was deposited full amt into my bank account next day. Then he start to persuade me to put in more money to up the level to earn more. So i put 4k then 6k then 10k. I said i dont have so much money. Then he suddenly told me that gift money promotion going to due soon. Asked me to load more if can. Still not giving up to persuade me. I feel so weird on his reaction already and so annoying on him. However to gain my trust, he load extra 30k into the platform under my account saying that want help me to earn more. He said this is last chance to grab the gift money. I really feel uneasy and wish to get back my money already. But too late, the account was frozen when i wish to withdraw all the money out. I was like shit man. Need to load in another 50k within 3 days to unfreeze my account to get back all the money. Then he told me that his account was frozen too. Then he show me his account have so much money stuck inside. He asked me to rescue him to load money into his account after i get back all my money. He broke. But i really do not have much money. He said he will going to help me to borrow from his friends and sister. I really thought can just put in the rest of money and get back all the money. Also can rescue this guy money. What the innocent thought! So i pump in. Then, the system prompt out bank info incorrect. Need to load another 30k. Then only realised I fell into trap. I told the guy it is trap, but he keep blaming me that is my fault to maintain wrong bank info. The suspicious things is the bank info previously maintained disappear. I told the guy I not going to top up anymore money. Blocked this number immediately. SCAMMER!

Then he recommended this investment platform by Charles Schwab giving the url (Note: Do not click) to set up account and start investment. Initially he asked to invest 500 usd, and the customer service provided the account number of an individual at ocbc bank. Money was successfully withdrawn with a $50 profit. Subsequently he asked to invest 5000 usd which the exchange rate used by the platform is 1.5. The second round of investment he proposed buying "0" at 100 which after a few rounds the number came out. The second day, withdrawal was not possible as the platform requires 30% of top up to prove you are not an illegal investor. 30% of 14,400 (gain for buying num 0) which is another 6.5k sgd. I threatened to report to police and the website is now inaccessible.

For me to fully understand how it works, she diverted me to a website - www.swell-pproject.com/index/user/register/invite_code/q734dz.html (NOTE: Scam website. Do not click) The website is badly designed, the graphics are all over the place and looks fake. In order to start, I will need to register to kick start this 'job'. But, i have not register and done anything as this is a scam.
I meet this guy via CMB APP addressed himself as join ( 李志辉) from hk but have been in SG for about 6 years, having a job in AMK link. After we are matched via the apps he approached me and asked to chat in WhatsApp so we chatted and do WhatsApp calls for 2 weeks. He is very nice in his text (in Chinese) and calls show concern, texted me every day to night, and we shared story as a child till current. It seems we have common interests (things go well) but he started confess of 'like' and we had not meet each other, I started to feel the red lights, was avoiding then he started to do sweet stuffs like planning itinerary for us, making promises and commitment for future (to all out there don't fall for it). He has also trying to persuade me to invest with him to build good foundation as he plans to retired 7 years down the road. (2nd red lights) we have conflict and debated on this 3x till I told him I am not interested in investment if you feel this is important to you and I am not going to be in line with you, you can decide on this 'friendship' (my purpose is to see his reaction), expectedly he feel we should put a stop since we are not giving in to each other. But weird he can still texted me after a week of not contacting. Just to share although I did not lose any monetary, but I lose trust in dating app. So guys and girls out there pls be caution! I am not sure if he is a real scam but is a lesson for me.
Someone by the name of Xue Er approached me on telegram asking if i was int in a part time job. I asked what the job was and they said she will train me to her in charge. I gave her my phone number and the next day her in charge, Jessye texted. I inquired in the job further and decided it was worth a shot. She gave me a link to log in to a pepperjam website but it was sketchy. I tried it out on her acc and she earned around 200, i earned 150. She then asked me to optimize 45 data but I only managed to do 20 before my account balance was " insufficient" she told me to top up the acct but luckily I didnt even have enough in my acc to transfer, so I left her on read. Luckily none of my details except my phone number were given.

Scam call center from India impersonating as singtel internet service provider. Caller's name was Johnny with an heavy Indian accent. He identified himself as a staff from "Singtel" and said that I have problems with my internet services. I answered him that in singapore, we have other internet service providers besides Singtel and that he can't even identify me as not being a singtel internet user. He insisted that all other internet providers are using Singtel's line which I told him if this was the case, then the other providers should be calling me instead and not him. I told him that he is a scammer (which he insisted he was not) and hung up.
An “agent” pm me supposedly offering a job but it was like an order task to get commission. There are several tiers - 0-5 - which will result in varying commissions. Vip0 is basic and I earned about $3.50 a day and minimum withdrawal is $50. After withdrawing, you will need to put in $20 to earn again. This part is the red flag and I did not proceed. In addition, the agent sent me an invite to telegram group whereby u will find people who are like-minded, putting in like 1k/2k and even 5k and seeing them do mission and withdraw daily. In my opinion, I feel those people in the grp are a bunch of fake acc. When asked in the group chat about the background of company and a proof, the admin will brush away the question. I went to check their profile and almost all the profile pic were created in the early of dec. I used my another telegram acc to pm one of the scammer and basically asking the obvious like their name such as "are you ____?" then she replied me with a '"no". Few secs later, she replied yes. When you receive unsolicited job offers, beware.

I received a call from a person claiming to be from Singtel. He said that he wanted to help me stop other people from missing my internet connection. i do not have any singtel internet connection. when I questioned him about this, he said "singtel is the mother of all internet connections in Singapore and they are helping everyone". He wanted me to open my computer and run some commands to prove that other people were missing my internet connection. i asked him for his employee ID. He confidently said it was dm74962. he also mentioned my case number as 23992. He also mentioned that the office address was 31 exiter road singapore :). I did not run any commands on the computer and disconnected the call.
I was in need of money due to tightening financial burden in the family due to retrenchnent in the family. I came across this moneylender who called themselves "Lending bee" via the Internet. So, I approached them whether UNEMPLOYEd people can apply for loan. They said YES. So I send my relevant documents over. after sending my personal details ANs relevant DOCUMENTS, they send me An contract to SIGn. Yes I did. Then a lady named Olivia lim approach me, call me to tell me to pay processing fees of $2380, lawyers FEEs, admin fees, red charge fees, round out fees all added up to $33,500. Then there 's STEVEn (ACCOUNTING) guy say I just need to pay 4.5K I can get all my money back. After TRANSFERRIng so much money, I feel that everything was scam. Cos licensed moneylenders never ask you to transfer money first. I approached another moneylender, and they told that this is all a scam! So, I reported the matter to the police. Whether or not I get my money back, I take it as lesson learnt. All my hard-earned money are gone in a flash.

They are very friendly, making you thinking they are the right person to fall in love with. After that this person will start make excuses wanting you to help her with this "job". You need to get a list of purchase from a contact given: +65 8928 0370. Then she will guide you how to help her to make purchase. What scammers want at the end are usually the same things. Just to share my encounter to prevent others from getting scammed.
Marketing messages through uob sms - the same channel where i received otp. Proclaimed to offer promotional interest rate as high as 2.38% for amount ranging from $20k to $100k. Detail to contact : 83125795 I called the number above - answered by marcus. He asked for my personal detail to "create a special account on higher interest rate". I offered my name, nric, address - sufficient for him to create an uob account. He called me 15 minute later to inform me the account is ready for funding. He said "xxx-xxxx-xxxx" account is now ready for funding and request me to fund immediately so that he can send for approval at higher interest rate. Luckily, i was busy at that time so i asked to do this later when i am free. He got impatient and says the fund needs to come in as soon as possible, else the promotion may close. His attitude on "asking for immediate funding" gave him away - as my past experience with bank officers were never base on stress / pressure. I got suspicious and message a friend whom work for uob. She immediately send me a screenshot on uob internet banking that the above ruse is a scam! I was fortunate to pick up suspicious behaviour to avoid financial loss. I wanted to caution others to be extra vigilance. Our defence was lowered as the sms from "UOB" appeared to be genuine. Never expected that scammers were able to spoof sms ID...
I received a phone call from 95127959. An robocall message informed me that I was summoned by the Singapore High Court &amp; asked me to press "9" for details. I realised it's a scam. so never press any number &amp; ended the call.

I received 2 telegram msgs by name of ms CHLOE ( which seems FAKE ACCOUNT ), asked to join a JOB offer thru a std template msg" hi do you usually watch movies ? Our company need your help to increase movie ticket sales and awareness . complete the simple steps for a chance to win free movie tickets or cash prizes - students , non working people , housewifes are wlecome ." It became even more fishy as I received another mesage requesting me to refer my colleague to register for an account to participate in the activities thank you ". ask to go to an suspeicious watsapp link https://wa.me/6588953061 . The whole thing looked fishy and I blocked the contact.
I got to know these 2 guys named rayson and aaron via the dating apps - cmb / okcupid. Chatted with both on the same day last month, 16/11/21. shortly after, they deleted their profiles simultaneously and requested to have it chatted on another platform. so we continued our chat on whatsapp and line. it lasted for 2 weeks for rayson after he mentioned that he would like to intro me to cryptocurrency investment via 2 bogus platform and to provide me training on it to earn more money. besides that, he also says that he is currently in Japan but when asked him to send photos of him in Japan. He would reply what is the hurry and have lots of excuses. After realising that it was a scam due to inconsistency replies of info, i deleted and blocked him immediately. As for the 2nd - aaron tan, was still chatting with him and seemed like this way of communicating is quite similar as the first one. I seemed to be quite suspicious about it as he has excuses always when i requested for a videocall but ended up with a voicecall instead and that he sounded like he is not in sg which he claimed he is. sometimes on and off he would ask about my financial status and views of investment and asking me to trade with him so... this is another tell tale signs i guess. also, he would like to arrange a romantic outing with me but was always got delayed of his job or something else. Therefore, one must always stay vigilant and not to transfer any money out without even knowing the person.
I was contacted by Elise for a marketing freelance job to increase visibility and view rate of products by increasing data on their platform (www.bestvinculum.live). After explaining more about the company, she guided me through the steps. Firstly I had to create an account with my phone number. After creating the account, she told me to use her account first to complete the missions to get 20% commission into my new account. Then I’ll have to complete missions in my own account in order to withdraw all the commissions. So the job was to “click and submit data” but in order to click and submit, the account must have sufficient money to proceed with the order if not have to top up/recharge. To recharge, I had to contact the customer service WhatsApp number (65 88032130) and transfer money to the accounts provided. Yesterday (14/12) was to Chin Mei Yi, acc no. 7013563466 UOB, PayNow 6580146271. Today is to Loh Jia Le, acc no. 4303740338 UOB, PayNow 6587614013. Yesterday after completing her and my missions, I was able to withdraw the money I top up with and my commissions but today when I was trying to complete my missions, the amounts I needed to top up kept increasing. I top up a total of $580 already and I had to top up more so I asked Elise for help and she told me she wouldn’t help me and eventually stopped replying me on WhatsApp. With no help to complete the missions, I tried to get my money back. But when I contacted Customer Service, the person kept insisting I I try my best to finish all my missions and encouraged me to top up the amount needed in order to complete my missions and withdraw my money back and the commissions. That’s when I decided to contact the my bank (OCBC) to get my money back and make a police report.
I was contacted by joy who claimed she was from recruit express singapore. I provided the details asked from her and was contacted by hui qi from vinculum who briefed me on this part time e-commerce job which required me to collect data via their application in blue. on the first day, I managed to earn commission and decided to do it again the next day. afterwhich, i was unable to reload the amount required to proceed to finsih the 30 jobs in order to withdraw my transfers with commission. Reached out to Hui Qi who asked me to borrow money from my friends &amp; family to proceed to the last reload but when clarified, she claimed it was based on luck. I asked her if it was possible to just transfer me back my money as i didn't want the commission anymore. she said "No" as i needed to complete the 30 jobs in order to make a withdrawl of my transfers with commissions. i have transferred most of my savings now and i honestly don't know what to do but hope for the best after lodging a police report and seeking help from the bank. If you have fallen prey to this scam, please file a police report and stop all conversations with the scammers.
I got a match with this girl name Xiao Yu on Facebook dating. She says she provide sexual services for 130 for two hours. We agree to meet on 2 dec 2021 for two hours at Aljunied MRT station. When I reached, her "manager" call me and said I need to pay a protection fee of $200 via AXS machine of razer gold and another $4600 of insurance fee of razer gold. I was being stupid so I paid, after I exceed my card limit, this ah long told me to buy $1000 worth of iTunes cards. After I brought it, I told him I don't want the service at more and I want my money back. Then his "boss" called me and said the money would be refunded after I paid his two runners $4000 . I went to the bank and withdraw only $4000 and used it to buy as many razer gold cards as I can get my hands on. After I brought the gift cards and send to them via whatsapp. The "boss" call me and said i need to give another $4000 again because it is two runners that is $4000 each. Not $4000 for both. I realized it was a scam and reported it to the police asap after they threatened to hurt my family by coming down to my block and sending me videos of illegal activities. I blocked all their numbers and every number they used to harass me. I lost about $10k.

This is a cryptocurrency investment scam. In nov 2021, i was matched with a handsome guy on coffee meet bagels named justin lee with the whatsapp number 82400495, with the email: lil588841@gmail.com. His profile says he is an r&amp;d manager in a clean energy company. With a ntu master's degree. The relationship goal is marriage. Similar to other scam stories you read here. This person quickly asked for your whatsapp information, saying he is busy and not always checking cmb. Say good morning, good night, and chat with you everyday, showing they care about your wellbeing and gradually gaining your trust. Expressed strong feelings for you and said that he wanted to build a family with me. Started to talk about crypto investment on day2 and tried to get me invest in a crypto short futures trading platform called xm (https://www.xmpra.com/#/). You need to contact customer service via whatsapp to deposit and withdraw money (to or from another user's bank account, which is weird). Initially the amount was small like 1k for a 60s futures investment (following his instruction at his calculated time) and you did see profits. However, he asked me to invest more in order to profit more. My bank rejected the transaction and filed a police report. I listened and pulled my money out from the platform. But somehow i still trusted the guy because he said he already planned a really nice meeting for us and continued to chat with him, because he stopped asking me to invest in this platform after my objection. However, he later introduced me to mining in coinbase wallet. Since it is legitimate, i started to do that and did see profits. He soon asked me if i could borrow him some money to do a big investment and will give my money back on the next day. I did but he found different reasons to ask me for more and showed that he was investing on the xm platform for me and even shared the account password with me to assure me. The money doubled and he said he will withdraw. However, he said that a 28k usd tax needs to be paid in order to withdraw the money and shared his chat with the customer service, after i asked. I just wanted to get my money back so i sent the tax money they asked for. Then he blocked me and the customer service also blocked me on Whatsapp.
I met this person on coffee meet bagel, he claims to be from china shanghai. we exchanged contacts and continued on whatsapp. This person quickly "fall in love with you" and introduced me to a chinese platform http://udsv.xy?/?, saying he wanted to help me earn money. Initially, he invested a very small capital to let me try, and together with the winning amount about 200 bucks was deposited into my account. He then start persuading to put in more money so that i can earn more. So slowly, i input 2k then 10k. At this 10k stage, i wanted to withdraw the money and stopped playing as it get more dubious to me. However, I was not able to get out the money due to the reason where the cutoff time to withdraw has close. the next morning, he told me that the room to bet with 10k is not stable and i will need to increase to 50k to go to the next room to bet in order to withdraw all my money. I was stumped, i don't have so much money on hand. he claimed me he going to help me get his sister and mum for help. he put in 6.4k which he got from his sister and 5k which he got from his mum. he deposited the money into the platform under my account. At that time, i really thought i can just put in the rest and take back all these money. so i stupidly, put in the rest of the money. however, while i was depositing this sum of money, the system support ask me if i would like to join the activity to earn more money. I asked the guy what is this as my chinese wasn't that great. he asked me to join and he claimed to join the activity too. In the end, this activity requires me to pump in another $50k within 3 days in order to get all my money our. and in his case, he claimed he needed to pump in another 130k to get out all the money. I told him i have no more money and I rather lose this money then losing even more. After the activity ended, he started blaming me for everything. he kept harassing me to return the 11.5k that he has put into my account. he even got his "sister" to contact me, the number is a sg number but he mentioned previously, his sister is in china. Both numbers have been blocked and case is reported.

Then at the third transaction, the amount got bigger required got bigger and so I fell deeper.

Someone called Grace contacted me on Telegram to ask if i was interested in a freelance part time job. after replying yes, i was contacted by the person in charge who introduced herself as Stella (80133591). she introduced herself to be from "Rakuten" and was supposedly hiring a marketing job. the job is to boost products on rakuten. she guided me to register for an account at the website, and guided me on how to earn the commissions using her account initially. The activity required me to make orders of products. one round consisted of 40 orders before completion and withdrawal of funds. at certain phases, a top up of funds would be required. she explained that these top ups indicated "bonuses" - chances of earning more commission. it appeared to be true as the commission would increase after the top ups. she would top up to her account for me to complete the experience. once completed, she added me to a group chat consisting of her group of members and she asked me to use my account to try. For the first round using my account, she said I could use the referral amount and commission i earned using her account to try, amounting to approx. $55. the first round was successfully completed and i managed to withdraw all the money, profitting approximately $60. for the second round, a larger initial deposit of $100 was required. multiple top ups of larger amounts was required. i deposited multiple amounts of hundreds of dollars while accumulating 40 orders, amounting to a total of $2000. I expressed my worries and anxiety on the group chat but was reassured by the members who claimed that they had been doing this for quite awhile with no issues. after i had deposited more than $2000, a fourth top top up of $2800 was required. I told stella i did not have enough cash to top up and asked for her help. she ghosted me eventually and I did not perform the top up. at this stage i had not reached 40 orders and could not withdraw my money.

i got scammed of $1700 !!!!!!! and i am just a part time student and a part retail sales. this person who she deleted her telegram account right after she introduced me to her friend name Debbie. Debbie told me she is a recruiter from rakuten and she asking me if i am lookin for a freelance job, and what they are doing is boosting products to increase visibility rate and purchase rate of the products Firstly, she asked me to go to this website "www.best-rakuten.online to register she is claiming " i need to help her account to increase the data after i done the work i can get 20% of the commision from the cashback that earned in her account the process will be in the website and abt 30mins to complete and also able to earn up to $100. So after i registered she ask me to use her account to complete 40 of her orders and she will give me some of her comission and was sent it through my account that i had just registerd how they actually do it is when there is an insufficient balance we will have to top the money and this is what she did in her account as well. So once, I reigstered i have $10 extra with her comission .... so for me to take out the comission i had to complete my 40 orders in myaccount how they actually take the money is by a third party through whats app chat. can be paynow or through internet banking screenshot to them and put it in the whats app. before sending them money we have to state " our handphone /recharged money". The first time, I get my comissioned and my actual $200 that i had put in the 2nd time when i used her account to do the same the i had $300 in my own account but the down time when i have to deal with their insufficent balance or NEGATIVE numbers i ask them to lend me some money and will return them back but since really didnt want to do these kind of call "job" they scare of me scamming them their money.. and i had receive no help and they always tell me to follow the rules so since they did not trust me. and they want me to go ask for help? like my friends /family or relatives.i decided to report this to the police..... They even laughed at me when i say this job is actually a scam .... and i am too stupid to trust their nice word .... scammer will always ask u to lend money to ur family friends and relative but when we ask them to lend their money to you ... becuz there themselves is also scammers they will lend...trust me this ppl are professional scammers who scam ppl's money.
This happened just yesterday, after they sent me through telegram and was told to offer me a job. But the telegram chat was deleted right away after i apply this so call "job" and it’s was her friend looking for someone for her help. So pass my contact to this person named d from WhatsApp. This person first asked me to register the account through " www.***t-rakuten.o**ine" after which I did follow what she ask me for. The job scope was that I needed to help her increase her data and get 20%comm cashback and earn abt $100 The lady let me use her account to show me how to do. By "recharge the money" from a whats app chat. I have to stated recharge money den they send me their bank details and all i need to do is to do a screenshot the money she had transferred.in the WhatsApp chat. After which she told to use my own account to do it follow the step she told me to do. Steps : is to finish 40 orders and if I have the negative I have to transfer money like what she did each time is $100 for the first time, so the first time I got my commissions. After I’ve completed the task, they invited me to the group chat where people use this to scam more ppl. So the 2nd time I use her account to help her since she offered me to do her orders .... But this is where the scam came in becos’ I got a few negative balance which I had to transfer the money and do a screenshot like what she did? Because the amount was too big for me to handle as a part time student and a just a part time retail sales. This is where all my money was gone because i could not afford they told me to ask for parents , relative and friend to lend money from them I asked them for help by lending some money but since they are too selfish to lend me since they scare i scam them becuz i just want to clear this one order and i check with my friends and family they told me is a scam. TO LET THE POLICE DO THE JOB . THATS WHY I DECIDED TO REPORT TO THE POLICE FOR THIS INCIDENT PLS DONT BE LIKE ME GETTING SCAM FOR EASY JOB OR GO AROUND GETTING FRIENDS FOR HELP.
I experienced something similar to the person who posted here on 7 Dec (But it is a different phone NO). Caller was a woman who sounded like someone with a South Asian descent. Claimed to be from Lazada, and informed me that An order of $600 was made on my account from Germany. I was afraid that it was a scam and didn't want to prolong the call. So I said that "Okay, let me check my account again and see if anything has happened". Of course nothing happened.
Got a text message pretending to be from "Singpost". Message is about a delivery failure. Requested me to click on a link to a fake SingPost site. I provided my address, bank details and CVV number. After submission, fraudulent transactions were attempted and I lost over $900. Beware of smishing and Do NOT provide your personal details without verifying. Look at the URL of the website, pls.
Someone with a strong Indian accent called me that someone using a Malaysian IP address had used my Lazada account to purchase a macbook pro. I used Google account to login to lazada and if google detected that my google account was used to login to a different country on a different browser, it will alert google on my phone to approve the login which i didn't receive. This is definitely a scam!
Caller claimed to be monitoring my Lazada account for sony Tv purchase from germany. He sent me and otp and asked me for the number. I refused to provide and called the police. Police advised to share my encounter with Scamalert.sg. I verIfied with lazada and was told it was a scam. Beware!
I wasn’t actively looking for a job but i was in some jobs groups. On 3rd dec, This recruiter, Daphne, claiming to be from hays recruiters messaged me on Telegam sharing with me that they are looking for a responsible candidate for a job. I asked what "private" job and she doesn’t even know the full details of the Job. So she referred me to jaylin, her “cilent” from near pte. Ltd on whatsapp(she even know my number even though i never stated my number). Jaylin told me the job is to do 40 missions to boost products. Each time where i got a “packaged” Commission, there will be a negative Balance so i need to top up. I asked for the business id or anything that prove the bUSiness’s Credibility and she forwarded me a document with the uen which was legitimate. She even invited me into a whatsapp gRoup so i did ask one of the partIcipants just in case and she seemed so supportive and didn’t understand why i am so Cautious but she can’t answer my question on how much she earned on average per month. Also, someone was selling vaporisers on the chat and yet nobody intervened. I didn’t deposit any money Fortunately and left the groupchat and blocked the scammers. I also did report to the police the next day.

I didnt know i have to deposit my own money when theres insufficient balance. They told me i have to deposit as it is a bonus cashback and that i will get more money in return. So in a way, u have to keep pumping your own money till 45orders, the number of you crediting the balance is not consistent. So in my understanding you need to have atleast 10k-20k to standby for thr "bonus". They keep saying to finish all 45orders or your account will freeze. I stucked at -$5000 because i dont have enough money to deposit alrdy. They keep pushing to get money people. All in all, dont trust all the recruiter. This is fake recruiter. I cannot even get my money back
Voice call using whatsapp, with +65 mobile number. claimed that he was calling from CID. foreign sounding voice (human, as he waited for response) claiming that the atm and credit card i use are not verified by cid. next step was going to ask for info, but I hung up by then.

Beware and be careful. i've learnt that if its too good to be true, it is.
"Hui Ting" texted me on Telegram asking if i am interested in a job. she claimed shes from recruit first. she asked for name age contact and work exp. Then, a Sheryl claiming to be from rakuten asia pte ltd WhatsApp asking me open an account at some fake suspicious website. suddenly credit me $10. then i find it fishy. i immediately google online and i read others also who encountered same as me. I immediately block and delete them. pls be careful. scary world.
Received a message via telegram, hui ting. she is from job.sg and ask if im interested in e-commerce marketing. she then refer me to Reese (Rokt pte ltd). i did research their company and they do exist. so basically i need to complete 40 orders. She ask me to tried to do it on her account and see how the platform work (www.rokt.life) after that i did signed up my own account and received the 20% commission for completing the orders from her account and also received $20 as a new member fee. Reese then ask me joining her group. We also needed to recharge our own account if it shows negative balance. she assured me that as long as i finish my 40 orders i can withdraw the money back. 2nd day when downhill, i was doing my 40 orders and i realised that the value of the negative balance was getting higher. I contacted Reese that I couldn’t afford anymore and what happened if I could not recharge my acc. she ask me to try my best to recharge my negative balance and she can’t help me. I also contacted customer service, they also inform me they can’t help me and if I couldn’t pay up within 24hrs they will froze my acc for 180 days. I won’t be getting back my money... so I even desperately ask the group if they were able to help me. but all they can say is , "10 more orders, try your best. why asked from people you don’t know for help. why not ask people around u for 1k each. once u finish 40 orders , u can share the commission with them. Beware, guys. I know this job is too good to be true. there is no such thing as easy money.
FRIEND GAVE MY DETAILS TO RECRUITER (ARIEL LEONG XIN YI -TELEGRAM) says she from Recruitfirst helping ppl find p/t job. next day person called Maggie texted me on WhatsApp telling me that job is to help increase visibility of products that are required from the merchant on top cashback (https://www.topcashback.live/index/user/login.html) and that I will get 20% commission. long story short, after seeing and experiencing for myself (using her acc) that the money is indeed not lost, I topped up $100 to try for myself. completed 45 orders but couldnt cash out as it was 11+pm and their CS 'closed' at 1030pm. I tried to withdraw the next day but they said that I would need to complete another 45 as it is a new day. I completed till 10 when there's a premium mission of $540. thinking it would be the last, I deposited and met with $1600. I told Maggie I have no more money and she offered to help deposit $500 so I deposited another $1100. but the next premium appeared and require me to deposit $2.5k++ which I am not able to. I contacted CS for a solution to get my money back but they say I have to follow the rules of the platform. when asked Maggie to meet me to help me complete and take back her money, she refused to meet up, using covid as a reason. told them I will go to the police, they say police will not be able to help me as the only solution is to complete 45 to be able to withdraw. ask CS for company address and they gave me 138 market street #32-01 Capitalgreen Singapore 048946 which I googled and direct me to Rakuten. when I ask for their company reg number, CS told me to just go to the police, saying that their company has its own team of lawyers. they also added me into a group where others share their earnings. not sure if its real or not. my guess is they're all the same person with fake display pictures. They didn’t block me nor removed me from group. Maggie doesn't seem interested/desperate to get her $500 back and both stopped contacting me. Since then I’ve went to the police and contacted my bank. Not sure if I’m able to take back my money but am sharing here in hopes of preventing others from getting scammed.

A lot of other people have been receiving unsolicited telegram messagse from this person name Vanessa, claiming to be from recruiter first, provided me her full name and cei number even. (used to register job seekers). then linked me to another person called elise who guided me to go to this website called rokt. the website is myrokt.online. Then would ask you to sign up, then log in and do job requests/offers which will pay commission. then will ask u to repeat the steps on your own account. they will give u like 20 dollars first, which u cannot withdraw until u have completed 40 orders. fake, scam and the moment u hit like 10 orders, the account will go -1000 which u need to topup. Don't respond to such unsolicited job ads without verification.
Recently I was job searching for a home-based (wfh) position and notice this ad posting on jobstreet (it was removed after). On 26/11, I was contacted by an agent called Kelly and she has introduced herself as a recruitment agent from a local agency. She asked if I am interested in an e-commerce WFH, part-time doing order optimizing and I will be contacted by her colleague later in the evening. Around 7-8 pm I was contacted by another individual called Amanda. Claiming that she was from this local company that helps to promote different products and my job scope would just be clicking a button on the website and I would earn 20% of the commission of these orders. (based on both of the individuals I believe this was a scam because 1. Both individual claims a different company that I was representing. 2. When I asked the agent (Kelly) if you require my cv for more information she did not respond to my question. 3. The website was created harshly.) However, I was curious and decided to play along to see if I’m able to get some screenshots and report this or just to keep to let my friends know about this job scam. After a whole night of clicking, Amanda invited me to a group chat inclusive of various members and provided me with an account to continue my job scope. I believe this was well planned, as they have scripts and groups to support their legitimacy of the job scope. But I believe it's a scam because of the various indications mentioned above.
Recieved a call from a person pretending to be Singtel staff. he Told me that my internet network has unusual activities and people are using my network illegally.

I got suspiscious when he asked me to open my event viewer. i then Told him that I want to do it another time instead and he sounded upset. I said I was in a meeting and he say he'll call me back. I requested to call him back instead but he did not want to give me contact details saying that the hackers will have information on my phone line. I told him that I don't trust him because he didn't not want me to call back and he hung up.
Firstly, someone called an "Alicia" sent me a unsolicited job offer on telegram promoting e-commerce marketing for $40/hr for a company called "rokt". after providing basic personal information such as name, age, job experience she referred me to another person, called "Sally". sally then proceeded to ask me to register for an account on www.myrokt.life (Note: Scam site, do not click) by this point, I was certain that this was a scam, although I did not lose any money, this is just a warning to all others out there.
Caller pretending to be from SingTel. Said that all internet network uses SingTel infrastructure. Said that me network has unusual activities and people are using my network illegally. Asked to access my pc and network. Declared that he is from SingTel and is calling from comcentre. Rattled off a string of employee numbers. Stopped the conversation when I asked him to stop and question his authenticity. Hung up when I asked for his staff id for verification before proceeding any further.
A guy without introducing himself and without any preamble asked me to confirm my ic number. When I asked him his name, he said he was Michael. Then I asked why his number indicated overseas prefix. He said he was calling from mom but the number was overseas. I asked him why would mom's number be with the prefix +1. Then he started shouting at me and asked me to provide my ic number. I said he should answer my question first. I could hear some guys shouting in the background "confirm your ic number first" again and again. The background was extremely noisy.Then when I refused to give him my ic number he called me a dumb lady, I said that he was dumb to assume that anyone would give him their ic number when I can clearly see it is a scam. He asked me if I was Singaporean, I said no. Then he shouted some obscenity at me and told that he can hear from my accent that I am Punjabi. I said sorry, I didn't understand him. Then he asked if I could understand Punjabi. I told him I didn't. Then he kept shouting obscenities and asked me to give my ic number after which I disconnected
Got a job scam. It started when I received a telegram message offering me a job which an attractive pay. I said yes to it and it referred me to a person called CYNthia and she contacted Me through WhatsApp. She said it was a job of optimizing data for a company called impact. So basically I have to sign up on a website and optimize data for her and I will get 30% commission for it. After getting the commission I had to repeat the steps on my own account. But one thing to note is that if my account is negative balance, I have to top up my own money to complete the optimising data, but I will get my money back. Luckily I was suspicious of it when it happened and didn't lose any money.Editor's Note: Please note to never interact with job scammers as the money that victims initially may be illegal proceeds.

He was waving a lanyard 'police' tag and claimed to be a Singapore Police officer investigating atm scam. He asked me to show him my atm card a few times.

He used a Korean plastic surgeon photo on his website (ig: plastic. Pasta) his whatsapp and on fb dating app. He wrote he is an orthopaedic doctor in the us, and joined red cross, divorced, and visiting his mum in Korea now, because she is sick, but going to come to Singapore to set up a clinic and find mrs right, to fulfil his late father's dreams (also a doctor and Singaporean). The website is fake but looked quite professional. But some photos are quite bad resolution. That address he has there is a residential address. He also has his WhatsApp link in that website, to prove to people this website is his to gain creditability. He says he closed this clinic during the pandemic. He speaks very good English. He has not proceeded on to show his intention yet before I found out he is a catfish. Have reported also to the plastic surgeon whose photos been used, on this as well. Just don’t believe a website that might look real to give that person creditability. Most importantly meet the person up then believe he is real n make sure never asks for money, or risk your family or your own details until u verify them.
Someone texted me on Telegram and ask if i was interested in a job, felt sketchy but said I was interested. Pushed my number to someone named “peggy sim” probably a fake alias on WhatsApp. Peggy told me company was “Rakuten Asia” and told me to sign up with a website called bestrakuten. After signing up, I saw that there was an option to top up the account and I knew it was a scam .
I received a test message from a so-called "OCBC BanK' with the following details: "Introducing oCBC latest fixed deposits promotion. amount starts from SGD 20,000 - 100,000. interest rate as high as 2.38% contact 93546975 for more info." I checked OCBC website, there was no such promotion and the rate seen too good to be true. Likely to be a impersonation scam or Phishing scam.
Received two calls from +65 63253619, and +65 6532 6938 this morning and afternoon, within a span of 2 hours. Same lady with an Indian accent on two different numbers. claimed to be from SingTel, calling to report that multiple IP addresses are coming from my internet and was asked to disconnect them via a website link. when queried on what contact number to call back, and challenged that SingTel is not an ISP, the lady put down the phone.
The scammer called me and ask me if i had ordered anything from Lazada last night. He said he is calling from Lazada. I said no. He said a order has been made last night under my email add. Then he said he need to reset my password. He told me to check my email and true enough there was a email from Lazada. He asked me for my six digit number so he can cancel the order. I did not give it to him. Beware all!
I was first contacted by someone called Sophia on Teegram to introduce me a job that is $50/hour. So this person called Peggy contacted me on WhatsApp. She told me that i can just top up money and earn commission from there. At first, I thought that it was dubious and then she added me to this WhatsApp group chat where there are many other members in the group doing this commission thing. I eventually trusted them and follow the guide to top up money. They then told me that I have to complete 40 orders (on a platform bestrakuten.site) to withdraw the amount. I was committed to it and kept thinking that i will complete the order soon. I then found out that the amounts got larger and larger. But i still continued after i had a phone call with Peggy for 15 mins. After transferring to the admin (via paynow several times), she then went MIA. I have a total loss of 31k. I’ve lodged a police report.
I received an unsolicited Telegram message from "Emily" on 26 Nov 2021. She claims to be from RecruitFirst pte ltd. She WAS offering $40/h part time work For 1-2h a DAY, no experience needed. "Emily" asked for my name, contact number, age and job EXPERIENCE, which I gave. After that, a "Peggy" who claims to be from Rakuten Asia PTE ltd contacted me on WhatsApp (her WhatsApp bumber IS +65 8918 9212. She talked about boosting products on Rakuten, but I did not understand the "job". She asked me to create an account: click the link to sign up for an account https://www.bestrakuten.online/index/user/register Invitation code : Z42RH5 you start the phone number with 65 without the + SYMBOL Then she asked me to claim SOME member rewards via a "Rakuten customer service" (number: +65 8896 5843). I did that and the newly made account showed a $10 balance. I did not follow up with "PEGGY". The next DAY, "Peggy" sent me a screenshot of a bank transfer "Transfer 20211127 UOVBSGSGBRT7101542 OTHR +$141.00", and a message saying "don't stay in bed, unless you can make money in bed". All this was getting really suspicious. A professional recruiter would never say THAT and the "job" seemed dubious. I stopped all interactions with them.
Received a phone call from (+65) 87554477, with a robocall stating it was Singapore High Court, and I had a summons pending. First in english and repeated in mandarin. needless to say, I hung up the call. I had similar calls from "dbs bank" but never from someone impersonating the high court. sharing to raise awareness here to stop others from getting scammed.
There were fake ads sent via Telegram. The ads were somehow created by a prestigious recruitment agencies, offering freelancers to WFH in their free time and all they need to do is to click on the product 40 orders to boost popularity and there will be a slice of the commission. after that, the scam company encourages the user (me) to top up money so as to get a higher commission. sad to say, I went for it. also, there was a group chat and everyone seem to get money. I have to top up in total s$39,600 and last round they asked me to top up s27k I felt something is wrong...I know right..is too late already. they refused to allow me to mitigate losses and withdraw my money. this happened very fast and I hope to alert people out there. act carefully act vigilantly. always call the recruiter to do due diligence. this grave mistake has caused me s$39600.00 is a massive price to pay. my entire saving is gone like that because of my lack of vigilance. I will be reporting to the police and if you have a similar encounter please go to the police to stop others from getting scammed.

The scammer said that he was from lazada and a hacker got my details and he needed to know my card details to reverse the charges and the otp number was needed to do the reversal. Very convincing and he said that he didn't want me to be charged for the hacker. ( he was the hacker/ scammer ) said he was from customer service and needed to stop the hackers from buying laptops on my account. I asked to talk to his boss and he let me .. I was too careless. After the phone call, I called the bank cancelled my cards then called Lazada and they confirmed it was a scam. Looked at my bank account for several days nothing appeared, then on Saturday morning, they started to charge to my account. They’ve done so thinking that I wouldn’t check my account, which was right. I went to the bank immediately and they started an investigation. The bank said that I wasn't the first person this happened too. The scammer was indian and the charges were from a business in new deli ( binge advisory private new Delhi)I lost S$20,000.
The story happened when i was looking a room to rent online. I found a room/apartment costs $800/month on ggg.sg. I then contacted the owner, and he asked for my email address to send me the details of the apartment. He claimed that he had ailment and his son brought him to texas for living. He is not in singapore and could not show me a room tour. (expose #1) While from the email reply received, I could clearly see the timestamp was not in texas timezone. (expose #2) I then asked for video call verification. He said he is on 'doc appointment'. Well, then he still could reply me immediately. (expose #3) I asked if he has any photos from last tenants to show and justify, but the photos were just too well and fake. (expose #4) I asked how many bedrooms were in the room. He said one, which matches with the photos sent, but i did a quick google search on the block -- and clearly that block only has 4/5 rooms. (expose #5) The person asked for my details information to help make a lease agreement, but i didn't. Thanks for hearing and be careful of the scams on ggg.sg.
I was approached by a woman on Telegram about some pt job paying $120-$150 per hour with flexible hours. I gave them my number and was contacted by a recruiter named Aaron sim +65 9037 8862. He taught me the ways of earning commissions by creating consumption data for vendors. Basically you need to complete 4o data missions before you can get your money out and i did for the first few tries. However, they have package missions where you have to top up more before you are able to complete the missions. The money you transferred to will be a vendor account that will change every 10mins or so that is given to you by a WhatsApp customer service. The catch is if you cannot top up the amount they needed, all your money will be stuck inside. The amount will get higher and higher until it is impossible to top up anymore. I lost $1080, my next top up was supposed to be $1046.64 but luckily my bank blocked my digibank account and told me I was transferring money to a scam account. I was shocked at first and was unwillingly to believe but after some time i started to realise all the red flags that I have turned a blind eye to. The feelings I felt being scammed was hard and difficult to process. But I always tell myself, I am not alone and I will get through this. In my heart I am prepared for the worst that I wouldn't be able to get back the money but still hope is still in me. I rather get through this feeling a sense of hope rather than facing it with negativity. I wish everyone all the best!
The scammer told me he was from lazada and asked me to check whether i bought nike shoes for australia, which i didn't. He asked me whether i wanted to cancel the order and told me he'll send me a 6-digit code to verify that i own the account. I didn't think much and just gave him the code. After 15 minutes, i asked him why he needed to ask me so many questions (e.g. Do you know someone who lives in australia?, what is the name of your bank?) To cancel the order. I then went on the lazada website and realized that with just my email address and my phone number, he could click on "forgot password?" and log in with just the 6-digit code. I hope Lazada will change this. I then realized it was a scam and hung up. The scammer tried to call me back with the following numbers: +65 9781 2304 and +65 9750 1009. He had an indian accent. He probably got my email address and phone number from an online database. Luckily, there was no saved card details in my account so he didn't manage to pay for the 2 pairs of nike shoes he ordered from my account. I then called Lazada. They confirmed it was a scam and that the scammer won't be able to complete the orders without my card numbers. In the end, i only lost some personal information (full name, birthday, old addresses) but it's only because i was lucky that i didn't have any saved card details in this Lazada account. Editor's note: Never share OTPs of any accounts with anyone. By releasing these OTPs, you are giving the 'key' of the account to scammers.

I was approached by this person (@peggypleong) on telegram asking if I was looking for a part time job. she gave me 4 to choose from: Cloud task, data analyst, Brand Management, Growth Marketing. since it was my interest, i wanted to know more about the data analyst role, she asked for my number to transfer me to another person from the company who will tell me more about the role, also asked for my age. This new person- Lie Na - said that she works the company insiders to optimiZe data to bring good ratings and word of mouth, say will earn $80 to $120 a day, then gave me the merchant's working link platform. upon clicking the link, www.myinsidershop.live, it turns out the website was banned by the singapore police force so i couldnt enter, which made me suspicious of this person. she gave me another link, www.my-insidershop.live, that worked, and I made an account with some details she gave me. I was careful not to reveal any of my info like my ic, just wanted to see how this scam works. in order to start "optimizing" i actually had to key in my bank info so that i can "receive" the money, so I just stopped and didn't reply the person either.
Received a call from someone claiming to be lazada staff and wanted to warn me of a transaction conducted overseas. The person asked me for my email address that was used for lazada account and said that they will send me a verification email. i received the email and it was really from lazada, hence i told the verification number to the person. in fact, the person just used the email address to reset my password. When i tried to lock into lazada again, the account has been locked out. I immediately cut off the line and called lazada hotline, only to know that i had received a scam call. i immediately called my bank to block the credit card. One general rule: Whenever an unknown person ask you to share verification code or otp, never ever share it even if it is sent from an authentic email address. because that person just used your email address to reset the password. duh... they dont even need to hack into your account to achieve the same purpose. Just never give the OTP of any account to anyone.
Received a phone call on 26th November to my house line saying that this is a phone call from the Ministry of Health or in chinese, 卫生部. Unable to get their number as this is directly dialed into my house line. The call started with a robocall stating to do a self test for covid19 within 2 hours as advised in my own home. Automated call rotates in english and chinese with the same instruction. Alternatively, you can press "5" to speak to a personnel. When pressed, the call would be transferred to a heavily chinese accented guy who tried to impersonate a staff from MOH and trick you into sharing your PERSONAL information. They know the basic information of our ministry of health such as the ministry phone number, etc, but does not Know any of our PERSONAL information ( name, our contact, etc) . The caller ended the call when he realised that I won't get scammed.
It started as an SMS that claimed that your parcel was undelivered and returned to depot. Then a few days later, an sms that says parcel was awaiting delivery and requested you to link confirm payment of $27. Another few days later another sms would be sent to you to confirm payment of $2.99 for receipt by next 2 days. This is a scam.

Requested that i authorise them to cancel the order - and to do so needed to have my Amazon OTP to cancel the transaction.

I received a call from someone who spoke in Mandarin. This person was able to call me by name and he said just changed his phone, so I asked him to identify himself. However, he keep dodging the question saying he is a close friend of mine, saying he is a little fat. i when silence for 1 min, then he say he got another phone call coming in, and to call him if i remember who he is. so i went online to reverse lookup his number on https://mudah.net/sg what I found out that this number is a invalid number not tied to any of sg's telco. hence, I am now sharing this story as that was definitely a scam call.

A person called David reed called me from +65 9703 4989 posing as a Lazada fraud agent. He informed me that My account was being used by someone in Malaysia and they have bought a laptop and a camera. They sent a text from Lazada with an OTP, this was obviously to get control on my Lazada account. Please remember not to share the OTP with anyone. No one from Lazada would call you for it. I was almost fooled and was about to share the OTP, but I read about a similar post about a scam here. Editor's note: Lazada will never ask for your OTP, login and account details. Never share such information, esp OTP, over the phone.

I got a call from someone who claimed to be from Lazada, It was in regard to a suspicious transaction involving my account. He told me that the purchase was made in Germany and asked me to provide my details to block the transaction. When he cannot match to his records, he transferred the call to another Indian accent man. Second person told that there is access to account from Malaysia. and he said he need to verify further using phone number, since I have 2 mobile phone number (work and personal), he tried to confirm both phone numbers when he told my last 2 digits of the phone number which I felt they know both phone number already. I rejected to confirm, then he told he can try to block if can confirm which credit card is valid, and he told there is 3 credit card is tied to transaction (come from Citibank, DBS and UOB). when he want to confirm citibank, he just give first 8 digit of card number which is show card type and bank issuer only not identified account, and tried to get full credit card number, I suspected that he has one of my real card number, for citibank. He told some card number that didn't match mine. I became more suspicious that it was a scam + data collection, I hung up. From this case, no monetary lost so far, but looks personal info have been compromise a lot.
I’vs gotten a text on telegram for a job invitation. She claimed that she’s from recruit first. I believed as i have work with them previously. Aft that a person named Elise texted me. This job required me to complete 40 - 80 task a day. So when i did the 80 task on the first day, i did all the 80 task but still felt a little suspicious about the “job”. Greed took over me aft i gotten the first payout. The next day i decided to complete 40 task only however i am unable to withdraw the money as i did not complete the 40 remainder task. I made a police report afterwards. They will be investigating on this matter. As for now, I have not gotten back my money :(. I hope this matter will be solve soon.

An Indian guy called claiming to be from Lazada it security. Said my Lazada account has been compromised and will need to stop the transactions. He will trigger otp to me via sms to stop these transactions. Before that he could verify me by giving all my details. He has my name, email, address n knows my 16-digit credit card number. Keep asking me for the 3rd set of 4 digits of the credit card. He will also trigger emails to show the authenticity of the transaction going through and refund following that. I passed the details and fraudulent transactions were made from my account. Called the bank to cancel my card immediately and now the amount of $700 is in dispute.
I received a message from a Talentvis agent named jasmine Choong. Because I worked under Talentvis earlier before, I thought it was not a scam and that it was safe to accept the job. Afterwards, she directed me to this person named Agnes who then told me what the job was about, sending pictures and rules on how to do it. At first when I did it, I thought it was easy money yet too good to be true. She then made me join a group chat where there were other workers likely part of this scam where they share and boast about their earnings. Nonetheless, due to my greed, which makes me let guard down now that I realized when it was too late, I continued. But each time I submitted the orders, I could never reach 40 and it resorted me to borrowing money from close friends, relatives, amounting to a huge debt in total. Police report has been made on the day I borrowed so much and it is truly a painful lesson to learn. Never ever accept something that sounds too good to be true, and stop immediately to think about it whether it's the right choice. I only posted this after I saw someone else's post about the same lady. So thank you so much for coming out with the story, that I am able to share mine.
I received a call from a local number claiming to be MOH, however, Mandarin speaking with china-chinese accent. The scammer sounded very calm and convincing, He addressed me by my full name and said i am a close contact of a covid victim and would like me to pack up and he will arrange a pick up to a QUARANTINE center. However, he is not able to identify my home address hence I requested for an English speak and hung up the call.
Received a text message purportedly from Singpost twice requesting payment of postage charges of $1.99 for a package delivery. The message had a link which took me to a Singpost credit card payment page. The page was suspicious because every link i clicked on it, including terms of use, took me back to the same payment page.
I received a call from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Friday, Nov 19, 2021 saying I had a health risk warning. When I pressed "3" to find out more I was routed a guy who only spoke Chinese who said if i gave him my name it would look up to see what the situation is. He then said that I had come into contact with a Covid-positive patient the day before at Tan Tock Seng hospital and that I would be taken away and quarantined for 10 days within 2 hours. I asked for more details he said the hospital had my mobile number and also a Shanghai registered mobile number. When I said that I do not have a Shanghai number, he said that I would need to contact the Shanghai police station in Pudong to make a report, and once NCID received the report back from them the quarantine would be lifted. But it had to be done within 2 hours. He then put me through to the Shanghai police station where I spoke with an officer who sent me his police credentials via WhatsApp etc to verify that I was talking with a legitimate police officer. He also called me from the police station's number but wanted to conduct most of the call via WhatsApp instead. However, in order to file a report, I had to WhatsApp him a photo of my Singapore ic. But I became suspicious when later on, according a "central bureau" investigation, I was suddenly a suspect in a major money laundering case in Singapore as apparently there is an industrial and commercial bank of china (ICBC) account in my name that was part of the case. He proceeded to question me in the case, sharing details of the main culprits, the people they have hurt, etc and how I needed to cooperate with them to help solve this. But they told me i couldn't tell anyone else about this, and also had to check in with him 3 times a day moving forward. That's when I politely ended the call, and then immediately called NCID to speak with the "Mr. Sun yun" who originally contacted me and found out that NCID doesn't do contact tracing at all, and they have also been getting calls from the public who have received such calls and called them to verify. So then I realized for sure that it was a scam. I didn't lose any money, but unfortunately they have my personal information now, so there is a high chance of identity theft moving forward. This scam was very believable because the "police officer" seemed very knowledgeable and used all of the police &amp; legal terms you would expect in this situation, and gave friendly advice about how to avoid identity theft in the future (the irony of it all). Am attaching the “police ID” he sent me as well as the location of his supposed station location in Pudong.
I have always wanted to work part time/ freelance. Then came an AGENT joline cheong that claimed to be from " talentvis" posting and asking me if I'm finding a WFH job and part time. I complied as I would like to KNOW more. These people will be nice to you and manipulate you and it all seemed legit. Then she referred me to another person who texted me on WhatsApp . Her name is AGNES. She claimed THAT she HAVE a fast job for me that takes 30-60mins by completing 40 orders. At first i tried out for awhile and they gave me a commission for it and im like " oh this isnt bad ". But take note, do not fall for these as it is a way for them to get you in even more and have that trust. The orders get more and I would need to paynow a lot of money. If I never complete, I cannot withdraw back the money that I transferred over. I PANICKED, i wanted to get my money back and asked for helped but they laughed instead and tell you to get it done by the night or my " account will be frozen ". I lost some money to this scam. Please be aware everyone and if it is too good to be true, it really is too good to be true.
Indian man Called to impersonate Lazada staff. He asked if I purchase Sony LED TV to be sent to GERMANY which I didn't. He did verification for my number and email address. He attempt to reset my password by asking me to send him the 6 digit verification code. After repeatedly telling him that I didn't receive any codes, he asked me to download 'anydesk remote CONTROL' app in play store so that he can take control of my devices. Beware and do not download any software or pass any OTP to anyone.

He then Asked me to verify my details so that he can stop the Payment from going through. Thereafter i received an email from Lazada with an OTP and he asked for the OTP in the email. As i was on speaker mode, my husband asked more Questions And the man on the phone got irritated and hung up eventually. I called Lazada after that and they confirmed that the call is a scam call. Thankfully We did not reveal any Information to the caller.
This scam happened over telegram group chat. I lost about $4 but could have been more. The scam happened over a day. This "hui yin" will ask you to deposit money into myawin (site) and it required me to optimize data to get money (commission). the first time will be in small amounts but it'll shoot up to 500 or more very quick. The scammer can be found on telegram (fastjobs), number 84865451 and the awin customer service is 81994805. Be careful!
I RECEIVED A Indian caller INTRODUCING HIMSELF TO BE CALLING FROM LAZADA SINGAPORE and INFORMING ME THAT THERE HAS BEEN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES ON MY LAZADA ACCOUNT THAT MANY PURCHASES WERE MADE FROM DIFFERENT IP ADDRESSES such as Germany. He then asked for my email address and to spell out for him PHONETICALLY, i proceed to grew suspicious and wanted to speak to his superior which he passed the phone to another indian man which sounded like him. This time i asked for the reason why he needed verification given that he would already have my account details, he then explained that the email address is to check and be sure that they got the "correct account" linked to my name. the call was cut off mid way when i wanted his verification instead.
I was called by a person with an Indian accent claiming to work for Lazada customer service. he told me my Lazada email account (my email address) and told me that someone was using my account to buy expensive items. He then proceeded to quote my address, details of latest purchase and my credit card number and then he asked for the cvv. I realized it was a scam at this point so i hung up and called Lazada. Lazada says they will investigate and will email me to follow up. The number was a singapore number (9754 0830)
I received a SMS that Ninjavan will deliver a parcel that I ordered online. It gave a link on some real-time delivery. I deleted the SMS and thought that there will be no delivery since I did not click on link as I never order online. I investigated further via google and found out that it was a scam. At 5.40pm, the Ninjavan arrived at my flat with the parcel and I told him twice I did not order anything online and it was a scam. He checked his phone, muttered and left.
Similar to other recent posts, a man with an indian accent claimed to be from Lazada. He proceeded to inform that I made a macbook purchase yesterday, but i informed him that i did not make any purchase and then the call ended after it.
I've received a call from an Indian man, claiming that he is from Lazada. He said that there is a suspected transaction, an attempt to buy a canon camera from my account, and asked me whether I've made such a purchase. I replied "no", and asked what I had to do. Then, in a frenzy of unclear instructions and background noise, he said he will send me an otp sent to my phone, to authorise whether to cancel the transaction. The SMS, contained my Lazada OTP, but the message looked weird - there were 2 messages, both with different codes. He then tried to confirm my email address (incompletely), and instructed me not to share this with anyone, even Lazada, and asked me for the otp sent. I found it odd when he repeated the part about not sharing the message and this call with anyone, including Lazada, and even started shouting when I said I didn't understand his accent, I confirmed it was not legit and hung up the phone. I proceeded to change my password in Lazada. Please be careful of such calls!
I was working from home and i received a call from my landline. this guy told me that he is from singtel and he asked if my singtel connection is slow. I told him yes, sometimes unstable. soon he started to introduce himself and gave his name, ( I only remember Watson) and company id, slowly he asked me to download a program (ultraviewer) at my laptop so check who is using my broadband, the list came out and yes there is overseas country like Dubai, Australia etc. after that he told that he will be transferring the call to another team, cyber security so that they can track down those peoples using my broadband. when the call has been transferred, he introduced himself and gave his name (Ron Watson) and company id and workplace address to ensure this address is not fake and he told me that he is working with the SPF and government so that the can stop these people from using the broadband. HE ASKED FOR MY FULL NAME, ADDRESS, CONTACT DETAILS AND EMAIL ADDRESS. After that he asked which bank I am using and ask me to login (which I did) cause they found out that some people created fake account and transfer money to overseas, so they wanted to put a 10k into my account to track and catch them. luckily I did write down the amount of money i have in my bank. soon they ask me to carry on with my work and not touch the program and said they will contact me back shortly. i found something is not right cause the surname is the same, they did not ask for the name and nric who own the broadband and why is the broadband related to bank. i quickly close the program, change all my bank and email password. called SingTel to check and indeed it is a scam and SingTel told me that they will not call customer personally. called bank to deactivate my online banking as well. not long, they called again, i told them i am busy at the moment, they tried calling but failed. the next day they called again, so i ask them if this is a scam? he said no. i asked since it is about my broadband than why do you need me to login my bank? he ask me who told me that it is a scam and i told him, I've checked with SingTel and confirmed it is a scam. scolded him for doing this and hang up the call. if he said he is not a scammer, why didn't he call back? this is gonna be the first and last. let's stop these scammers from scamming more people. \ Do note that SingTel will not call you personally and ask you to login your bank account.

I was called by a person with an Indian accent claiming to work for Lazada customer service. he told me my Lazada email account (my email address) and told me that someone was trying to buy a canon camera on my account and to reset my password. He asked me to check my emails as i would receive an email 'from him' with a reset code. the email came from Lazada with a code and the man wanted to have it so that he could reset my account. I realised it was a scam so asked him for his details and address so that I could meet him face to face. He hung up at this point. He was calling from a Singapore phone ( 9755 8807 )
I received telegram job advertisement through aunty Yu (hp: +65 88196503) regarding job offer part time and earn some cash $80-$150 per day. Later on, someone named Sam contacted me through WhatsApp (hp: +65 81223527) and tell me all about the job scope (about boosting product for vtex and you can earn commission), and ask me used his referral code to open account and then let me try boosting product with his account. I was quite puzzled and just try boosting 40 product using his account and then i log into my account and some $100 commission. This bring some trust to this job but actually is definitely a scam. First time i try using my own account and earn $200 and i did withdraw back my money. However, second time i try to boost product by deposit the money starting $100 only, the product keep appearing bigger and bigger amount. I need to complete 40 product but unable to. They make me deposit $300, then $700, then $1500, then $4000, up till $50000 for each subsequent product. By right this is supposed to he job and you not supposed to give money to company to earn money. Some more money given much, much more to earn peanut wage. Until then I realised, this is getting nowhere and I am unable to complete my 40 time boosting product. I approached my so-called upline named Sam (hp: +65 81223527). He threatened me with death threat, and even want to go hunt me down because Singapore very small and he has big gang contacts behind this. A lot spam message me until i cancelled my number. This become very scary. And I realised this is definitely a scam. You all can trace that villain guy picture by adding this number (hp: +65 81223527). Inside the group WhatsApp, there are other people who are scammer party too, they will post all boosting product and withdrawal amount to get your trust. But only your account will need to keep deposit more and more money. T Scam company detail: vtex admin number (+61 422945114) vtex scam websites (NOTE: DO NOT CLICK) http://www.my-vtexshop.live/index/user/login.html http://www.my-vtexshop.online/index/user/login.html http://www.my-vtexshop.com/index/user/login.html They kept changing the vtex website because spf blocked it and warned public. Please listen to police. Do not believe this vtex job and also help spread to all your family and friends. Really hope these people get caught and bad karma one day.
Got offered a job on tele and then contacted the 'employer" on WhatsApp got told to do 45 data to get commission, pay was about $100+ per day for 2 hours of work. They'll let you earn money on the first day and after that on the second day they require you top up a really high amount and when unable to they'll lock your account and have you wait 180 days before getting your money back which really who would wait that long so i contacted the bank immediately and asked for a recall of funds not sure if ill get the money back but no matter you guys should try to contact the bank incase they have some way of hacking into your account. They might change company names or even phone numbers so beware of that. They'll add you into a group and have "new members" try asking whether u think it's safe to make you feel like you're all in this work together and even send pictures of their daily lives and how much they earn to fool you. So many people have fell for this stay safe guys im lucky i don't have much money in the first place so i stopped early here are some things that made me fell for it so you won't too1) family pictures (somehow felt like they can't be bad people lmao) 2) an existing company name 3) the high pay of course and the promise of getting a "bonus" commission if you commit one week 4) using their own money at first to earn commission 5) having "new people" in the group 6) they warn you to be careful of scam (ironic right) 7) make themselves seem highly secure 8) group members send pictures of their scrumptious meals and earnings in the group I’ve already contacted the bank to recall my money and lodged a police report. Do contact your bank and have your I-banking deactivated in case they manage to gain access into your account you will still be able to use your card and the bank and police will liaise together to try their best to solve your issue. They were really helpful with it so don’t be embarrassed to contact them but do take note that it is not guaranteed that you'll get your money back. I've read through similar stories after I got scammed and one said that the scammer told them that even the police won’t be able to help them but my advice is just lodge a report anyways and provide as many information as you can to the police. It seems that many are falling this scam recently since I think many students are looking for part time jobs oh and they do ask you to recommend the work to your friends thank god I wanted to test if it's safe first before recommending. Anyways stay safe guys hope you manage to find such articles about this scam before you actually get scammed.
An Indian man called, claiming to be from Lazada, asked me if I had purchased A camera from Lazada. I said no. he ask if it could be from a family member that use my account to do so. I SAID no. He said someone from HONGKONG hacked into my account and tried to make a purchase which was now pending. The Indian man said he would trigger an OTP to my SMS and I was to give him the code so he could cancel the transaction for me. I received the code, but I told him I did not receive due to poor reception although I did receive. he send again but i told him the same thing. He got impatient when I told him I will liaise with Lazada via email . i hang up on him and he never called back.
I was using a social app when a lady left me a voice message and texted me her Malaysian WhatsApp number for me to call her. when I called the number via WhatsApp, she did not answered. about one hour later, i received a WhatsApp call from a number starting with +92. A man with an Indian accent called to tell me that my atm card was blocked. he gave me his name as Michael john and he was from DBS, Kaki Bukit. He repeatedly asked for my passport number so that he can help to unblock my card. later on he asked for my i/c number. when i kept questioning him, he became frustrated and demanded me to give him my passport or i/c number right away. when i still refused to give it to him, he told me that my card will be blocked forever and all my money in my account will be given to charity.
I was first contacted by a person called jenny on telegram, claiming she is from hays recruitment agency and she got my contact from their recruitment data base. she asked if i was looking for a part time job and she will get her colleague to contact me via WhatsApp. shortly after, i received a text via WhatsApp from a person called Huiyin. she told me about this company called sears where they optimize data to help boost merchant's sales? we will need to optimize 45 data per day and get commissions by helping others too. i left her on read but she was very insistent and said to give her 10 minutes to explain what this job is all about. one moment i was letting her explain, the next i was already part of this scam. on the first day, i helped her to optimize 45 data and received a total of $150 commission? however i was unable to withdraw the cash unless I optimize the 45 data myself. and throughout this, I had to do funds transfer to customer service in order to top up my credit?? the whole process was very confusing and vague, even if i wanted to pull out i cant because my money was there. The first day, I earned $180, and it was transferred to my bank account. the next day, the amount got bigger and I transferred over $200+. the amount did not go down and it grew, that's when I realised it was a scam. I hope everyone stays safe and vigilant. these scammers are getting more creative and dangerous.
I was scammed $10k. A woman approached me on tele, offered me a part time job where I could earn money. I had to complete 40 orders and top up money into it if the balance goes negative. Each time the negative balance could reach up to $8k. I got added into a WhatsApp group chat with so many people sending proof of them getting back their money but I didn't.
Voice recording from MOH. Press 1 and transfer to a Chinese speaking agent that claim and insist that he is from MOH and quoting MOH mainline 63259220 and ready for us to validate. Unfortunately calling the mainline never get you to someone to speak with. Anyway ended the call and left a message with MOH quality hotline and let me hope that someone respond so that I can confirm that this is a scam. I don't believe MOH will transfer to a Chinese speaking agent given that English is our working language.
An Indian man called, claiming to be from Lazada, asked me if I had purchased an apple imac from Lazada yesterday. I said no. He said someone from Germany hacked into my account and tried to make a purchase which was now pending. The Indian man said he would trigger an OTP to my SMS and I was to give him the code so he could cancel the transaction for me. I received the code, but I told him I did not want to give him. He said, “fine, don’t come back crying to Lazada when you lost your money”. After hanging up, I tried the “forget password” feature and realised that was what he did to trigger the code to my SMS.
I was being approach by a guy which I met on Facebook. He said he was in Singapore, having an online business overseas. he introduce me to online platform which can be used for investment purpose. over the days, I have manage to earn the money however, later the platform have ask me to transfer money to two POSB accounts which would allow me to withdraw all my money I have made online. I've done a transfer of my life savings of $60,000 to the accounts I regretted what I've done as the money is to be used for my dad medical expenses while doing the transfer it have put my family in financial crisis. I really hope everyone can be careful online.
This woman approached me on tele and offered me a part-time job that I could earn $50-150 a day. When I asked if there was any commitment or deposit needed She said no. So I tried it out I needed to complete 40 orders to get my money back and I could not withdraw before that but the amounts they asked me to top up became more and more till it was impossible to top up. When I contacted customer service they said if I did not top up in 24 hours my account would be frozen for 180 days. When I said I would call the police they said the police was useless and would not help me.
I have read thru all the story posted here in this scam alert and to my surprise, i am not the only one who got scammed!!!! Similar to most of the story here i lost 2k to a job scam and the company name is Vtex which I spotted one story have the same scammer company name. The lady approached me to offer a part time job. She guided me thru the website how to boost product sale to earn commission and you need to top-up cash when the balance is insufficient in the account. I am not able to withdraw the money if I haven't complete 40 target. When i do the top up i feel there is something wrong with it and I stopped and asked the money back and the lady said I'm not able to withdraw as I didn't finish the target as a result my money stuck there and not able to get back. Beside that they will add u into a WhatsApp group, inside have about 8 ppl which I think all are scammers, they will post their achievements or how much they earn in the group to mislead you into continuing to top up your money.
This is a job scam. Had seen similar job scam asking to buy certain stuff online but this is different. On 14 Nov, I was approached by this lady called Elizabeth on Telegram (found account already deleted on 17 Nov) and asked I'm interested to do some freelance. I gave my number thinking what could go wrong, after this another lady Wendy texted me on WhatsApp on same day at night asking if I'm interested. she was very persistent and use high pay low effort to lure me into doing this. She claimed this company is a ACRA registered company in Singapore. Details given by her: Go-beyond international I made a visit to the company registered address and found that the company is not there. It is just a mailing company and is hosting a mailbox for this Go-beyond SG company. I then tried to call all the numbers in the group chat and found them to be invalid numbers. they would only call thru WhatsApp. They also refused to meet face-to-face.
I received a phone call claiming to be from Amazon Singapore saying my name and I am based in Singapore but they have received a transaction purchase from Germany which they find it suspicious as I am from Singapore. They verified my address and was able to mention the 2 credit cards that were linked to the Amazon account last 4 digits of my credit card. The lady went on to pass on to her manager as she claims he has to verify some details with me in order to stop all the transactions from the hacker. He asked me for my full credit card details of the 2 cards mentioned in the Amazon including the expiry date and the pin at the back. I initially find it weird, why would they require such details to such extent. He convinced me he needed it to activate the OTP sent via SMS from the bank and I just have to read it. This way they need me to approve the transaction which he is making so he can stop the payment and reverse it back to my credit card. I am clueless in this and he convinced me. Then he went on to ask me how many other credit cards I possess as the hacker might also hack into my other cards under my name and made other transactions with Amazon. At first, I was thinking how would the hacker able to find my other credit cards under my name and I believed him and proceed to give all my other credit card details to him including the OTP messages pin that comes in. It was until the last few credit cards that I name which is OCBC, UOB and CItibank. While I was still on the line with Amazon which was an hour now, OCBC called me regarding the transaction just made and I explained to them, realising that I could be scammed after informed by OCBC. They tried to call me another 4 times while I was still on the call with OCBC, each time was of a different number. I called all the banks to immediately block my card and stop all transactions and they will issue a new card for me. I went into Standard Chartered to file a transaction dispute then realise of the many transactions I have approved unknowingly which amount to at least few thousand KRW. UOB transaction was SGD2000+.and was always to the few same companies. I am glad OCBC managed to contact me and made me realise I was scammed, otherwise my money might have been taken.
I received a phone call from +6597610227 with a lady at the other end purporting to be from lazada: 1. She said she noticed unusual activity in my account now (17 Nov 21) and asked if i had purchased a video camera. 2. I tested her by asking her for my account details. She managed to give me my email address and handphone no. To my surprise. 3. I checked Lazada website and did not see any orders for a video camera. 3. She asked if she can cancel the purchase. I said yes to see what happened. 5. She told me an otp will be sent and i was to recite the otp to her. I received the otp afterward 6. I saw the otp stating that it is not to be shared with anyone, even Lazada. This is when i realised it was a scam. Most likely, the scammer managed to get the emails and handphone no from somewhere. I suspect they tried to change password and thus needed this OTP to access your account. This is very dangerous and i urge people to change their passwords immediately.
I received a phone call from +88199541678. The robocall informed me that the call was from the Singapore high court summons dept and I should press 9. After I pressed 9, a man called Alan Lim answered the phone after a couple of rings. he confirmed summons dept will make phone calls and he can check up for me if I provide him with my details. I argued back that he should know what summons (if any) and why I was being contacted. Guess he heard my typing to searching for sg high court webpage and hung up immediately. as it's a "+" number I didn't call back. but I see on the court's website there are many reports of such scams since 2020. I have blocked the number.
Received a CALL (Claiming from ICA) this MORNING. was told that my passport has EXPIRED. The call instructed me to press "3" to find out more. it was relayed to me in English and mandarin, twice. left me hanging for about 30 SECS, then ended the call.

At first it seems find &amp; able to transfer out with small amount top up, which is under sgd1000. by 16/11, I tried again but this round, it keep asking to top up until the last request was nearly 5k even already bank in for $4.5k. Due to no cash in hand, I needed to stop it &amp; as a results, all my money trap in there. the customer service was saying I must complete whatever request then only able to withdraw all. if the day incomplete, my account will be locked for 180 days although they saying the money still in there &amp; able to withdraw once I complete 45 "data". so far I seen many people playing it, even need to top up until 20k. I feel like been cheated. all my saving while working at Singapore all lost.
I almost became a victim of investment scam on a dating app (okcupid) by two men, but we exchanged messages in LINE App. First guy, we communicated for about 2 weeks. He sent photos of his dog, himself and I was attracted to his words. But I felt something was off when he started talking about how he wished we could travel together and so he introduced investing so we could save money for our travels. He Sent me photos of the places he went recently. Few Of the photos he sent were Taken from the internet. And Since I already had doubts about the guy, I did my research and read scam stories in dating sites. He kept convincing me everyday about investing but I never agreed to him so he just stopped communicating with me. Second guy, claimed to be From Singapore, also had the same tactics. He communicated with sweet words but i already doubted him because his English Was off, and sounded like he Used google translate. Sometimes he would send me messages in Chinese and then delete it. We communicated For more than a week and he begun Telling me about investing as his hobby. he has been doing it for 2 years and profiting everyday. I was suspicious so I try to sound interested about investing and did my own research. He sent me a link to a trading website to create an account. I looked it up on the internet and found out that it was a scam. So, I immediately BLOCKED the guy.
I was contacted through telegram by Amy Liew (Nov 3rd) and Julia Yi.T (Nov 16th) . they offered me a part-time job with ~$100 sgd - ~$300 SGD per hour pay. after replying, they contacted me through Whatsapp to send me the job scope. They claimed that it is a data optimization specialist job under the furniture company "Sear?" They also claimed that the job does not require any experience, interview, or fees for registration and withdrawal. thinking it was too good to be true, I luckily did not agree to anything and nothing was lost.
Started with a recording in both English and Chinese that there's irregularity and misuse of passport, and prompted me to press 3. Connected to a Chinese speaking person claiming to be from ICA, Chinese department, and to check what the issue is regarding, asking for my detail (name). I ended the call telling them to contact me if they have my proper details. I could hear in the background that there were others engaging in the midst of a call. Please be aware not to give away details that can connect a name or other information to the number that they contact you with. Better yet, to hang up if you are not expecting calls in case they get hold of your voice recordings for misuse.
I received a phone call from +6597333720 with a lady at the other end purporting to be from Lazada: 1. she said she noticed unusual activity in my account yesterday (15 Nov 21) and asked if I had purchased a video camera. I said I didn't even log in the day before. 2. she then asked if anybody in my family knew my login email, handphone number and password. I said nobody will know those and to login, a sms otp will be sent. 3. she then recited my login email and handphone number. 4. she then asked if she can cancel the purchase and of course i said yes. 5. she then said, in order to verify my identity, an otp will be sent and I was to recite the otp to her. 6. almost instantly, an otp was received however i said i didn't get it. 7. she said she will send another one and although receiving it, i said i didn't get it. 8. before I can say anything else, she hung up the phone. I then contacted Lazada help desk and informed them of the incident and asked them to investigate the case as the purported Lazada staff could recite my email login i/d and she knew my phone number and must have known my password as well, in order to login from her end and get the otp, albeit to my handphone. the only way it could be known was, for there to be a data breach as nobody else except Lazada will be privy to my personal info.
it was a sponsored ad on Facebook, in mid-september 2021, claiming that it was the official Lacoste store in change airport that had to fold because of covid and bad business, and they were clearing stock. The link would direct you to a page where you could choose the colour, sizes and cut (male/female). Payment would be cash upon delivery (so you have less worry about sharing credit card details). I bought 5 pieces meant as gifts for friends and family. so what happened was that the items arrived, you would pay the courier in cash, and then when you inspect the items, they were clearly not originals (much less from the official store at changi airport) and of an inferior quality (like those on the street stalls of bangkok), with suspicious packaging. So naturally you would email the company and asked for a refund, but they would stall for time, claiming that they are transacting while an agent, and the agent will require 3-5 weeks to process the refund. After 6 weeks when I tried to contact them again, as there had been no news from the "agent", they would already cease operations completely and no longer respond to messages. $83 for a lesson learned (including not being opportunistic and greedy), but I hope no one falls into this trick again as this is clearly cheating (fake advertising, etc) .
I received a call from +65 9610 5452, an automated voice in mandarin mentioned "MOH", "Covid" and to "press 3 for english." Upon pick up, a PRC mandarin speaking person says he is from MOH, and claimed I was exposed to COVID19 @ Tan Tock Seng hospital on a particular date. I have to undergo 10 days quarantine, and are sending an ambulance to pick me up. I told him my mandarin not good, and I asked to talk to an English operator. He kept saying I'm in the Chinese department so he will guide me. He kept talking to which I have no idea. In the end, he asked me to visit his office @ Outram park, 2nd floor, unit #16 to speak with an English operator.
The scammer with an Indian accent called to my landline saying they are a technician team calling from SingTel. They mentioned there might be some problems with my internet. They asked for some of my information like what device am I using, how many person in my household, how many lights are blinking on my router. After which, they told me to go to my computer and activate the command prompt. I told them I would contact SingTel directly to check and they hung up immediately.
I met a lady from Tinder (Username: Lim Aileen 35. Mobile: 8410 4006). she seems friendly and talk about her hobby/family. She is a single with 2 kids. Eventually she show me her "internet financial project", a screenshot of a trading account with $10k profit today. Using JP Morgan as a insurance finance to trade short term investments. She claimed her uncle is working inside the platform and can give specific order to place orders to earn 10% principle daily. Platforms (NOTE: Scam sites, do not click) http://o90s.xyz http://oews.xyz She keep showing her daily profits $10k, $15k. Eventually I gave in due to "trust" and place small $500. I start earning first few days and able to withdraw everything after trading ends. She keep telling me to pump in more money, and I placed $3800 and managed to withdraw the profits. Next few days, trading activity stops and no trades are done. She keep on pressured me to top up my account with fresh funds till $10k, before I can withdraw my account. She even suggest to borrow $ from people, just to top my account. I finally realised the red flags and did not continue to top-up. I don't think I will see my money ever again. Please don't be foolish like me.
I was approached by Chloe Lim in telegram, asking for work from home job @ $23 - $25 per hour. I questioned what kind of job and she replied that their job is separated into 3 types: cloud task, data analysis and marketing. She then mentioned that she do not have the full details of the job and will ask her colleague to show me the job sample via WhatsApp. To my surprise, she was able to tell me what is my phone number despite my telegram number is private. I then questioned on how she obtained my number, she mentioned that it was Hays Recruitment data base. Following on, her colleague named Yan Ni approached me via WhatsApp (HP: 88192195). She told me that the job is to boost popularity of the product. She then asked me to register via the website https://www.my-vtexshop.live/index/user/login.html via invitation code hxv5k6. After registered, she asked for my invitation code so that she can register her number under my referral. She then asked me to log in via her account (account number 6589896029 with password Yn666), and asked me to boost the product. After boosting 5 products, I logged in my account and surprising saw an increase in money ($60 for just boosting 5 products, i did not top up any money in the account). She then told me to boost for 40 products then screenshot to her. Knowing that it might be a scam, i have stop approaching her, but she was persistent in messaging me everyday. The last message was "Opportunities come to us every time, but if we don't try and understand them, they will slowly disappear and get further and further away from us. Join VTEX and make your life better!" If the police require help in catching the culprit, I am willing to assist (Yan Ni has been messaging me almost everyday).
An impersonated friend of mine messaged me (12/11/2021) on WhatsApp asking me to meetup asap for a massage. I mistook this information as going out for a massage together and agreed to it. She then called me that she was cash strapped and asked me to lend her $100 using ITUNES as payment. After that, I received a call from +65 81592980 telling me that he was her boss and that there was a procedure which I needed to perform, which was to give more money in terms of iTunes cards. Then I was asked to give $600 more as an insurance for not losing the cards. $800 was asked as they had no spare change (the 2000 spent at the end was supposedly to be refunded). Threats were given when i refused to spend the money (concerning family and myself). When they asked for $1200, I told them that I really had no more money and they told me that i could pay when I receive my salary (and meet up with her when I pay up). I decided to make a police report as it was seemingly like a scam (and it was concerning my personal services) and the lady was giving sexual services. I lost a total of $2100 before realizing it was a scam. And a word of advice would be that if you are ever threatened by anyone online, just file a police report and block the number (it is probably spoofed). They may continue to harass you but just ignore it :&gt;

After I've done a lot of research I realized I lost a large amount of money after believing it for a week I lost a total of 4k dollars to be exact. Then the person behind this is asking for another money transfer from me to be able to withdraw the money.

I was approached by this lady called "KiKi" on Telegram at first and asked I'm interested to do some freelance but I turned her down, not long after another lady texted me on WhatsApp asking if I'm interested. she was very persistent and I find it hard to reject her. So basically I needed to boost them by clicking 40 data to complete what they called a "duty". Data are randomized which some might culminate to 3 times of commissions. I was given $20 credit to start, I earned $60 but was later scammed $2,250. I need to recharge via pay now for the data to be completed to recover my initial capital. It got to a point where it is impossible to top up because it has reached more than a thousand. And they even mentioned that they will have legal actions against me if I don't complete the duty.
It started out with a simple telegram message (someone from hayrecruit/connecttap) will ask you if you want to work from home and be a data analyst and that you can earn 10-500 a day. Too good to be true. they will refer and ask their colleague who goes by "ANNIE" (+84409057) to assist you through this so. They asked you to boost 40 products to retrieve the money along with commissions. Here are a list of people in the group chat-&gt; +65 8819 6503, +60 17-631 0949, +65 81223527. +65 8307 1564,+65 8804 6185,+65 89250716, +65 8926 8106, +65 8927 2644. These group of people who typically add you in are all scammers and chat with you very very nicely in order to gain your trust and lure you to put more money and guarantee that you get back your money. These people help the scammers and take money from this disgusting business too. All the hard earned money is gone for me now and have to work x3 harder to get them back. Don't fall for this like I stupidly did.
I received a call from someone with an Indian accent claiming to be from SingTel's technical department. He said that they are detecting a router error and asked if I am facing any difficulties. When I said that I am not a SingTel subscriber, he said "OK" and ended the call.
This is just an alert to scam alert A man (real in person, not machine) called to introduced himself as an engineer from SingTel, says there is unstable connection with my WIFI and wanted me to check the setup box, tell him how many lights are blinking. he says he is seated at SingTel comcentre and read out the address to me. I believe this is a scam as I told him I subscribed my WIFI with SingTel via another company call marine and will only talk to representative from marine. he hang up the phone angrily. I am not sure what type of scam or if he tries to phish any information. I hope to raise this for awareness.
An incoming voice recorded phone received on my mobile from +65 94867737 @ 0841Hrs. Robocall claimed to be from MOH 卫生部 and said It's in regard to Covid. The instruction is to press 3 to continue the call. I pressed 3 and chat with a Chinese man sounded very Chinese, he said that my number has been reported to spreading fake covid 19 news and the phone number was china number register in Shanghai pudong airport, I explained that i did not travel and how could I register a number in China. Then he said that nowadays a lot of things do not need physical appearance to register *roll my eyes*. also He mentioned that MOH will sue me in 2 hours' time, then I replied if that is the case I will need to hang up the phone and call you back later as I need to contact my lawyer, after that I just hang up as it sounded like a scam. I am sharing the incident here to help alert others.
Received a call through VIBER with the number +658436006?, she said she is from MOM and that she needed the OTP for fwmomcare since my account was blocked. Editor's Note: Never share the OTP of any account with anyone.
This guy called whatsapp call and says that he was from DBS bank and wanted to inform me that my atm card got detained, Had strong Indian accen. I said i would ask the police if my card really got detained and he mumbled "fxxx".
Received a sms purportedly from Singpost and asked to follow up for a delivery by paying a small amount of $3 to process a delivery with issues. Due to busy schedule, I was about to click on the link before it occurred to me that this could be a scam to extract my banking details backend. Hence ignored the sms and shared this via website. It is very concerning that there has been a recent surge in the scams cases and as a result, many Singaporeans have been cheated of their hard earned money. Please be wary and stay vigilant. Take a second look at any unsolicited messages, emails and always verify. If unsure, don't click on the links found in these messages but go to the websites directly to check for any notifications.
The scammer called my phone number and was impersonating as an officer from the Ministry of Health. As I was skeptical, I asked for more details and that's when he hung up.
Needed to pay to earn commissions through product boosting. First I earned 10 dollars, so I was happy. But then the package deal went up to $300, then $688. After paying all of the requested sum, I lost it all.
I received a phone call impersonating that he is a Lazada customer service officer. He claims that I have a parcel with them and would like to have my OTP for verification. It did trigger an otp sms but I gave him a fake number and cut the call, knowing it is a scam call. Shortly after, I changed the password of my Lazada account as well as the default payment details.Editor’s Note: Please do not engage with scammers if you know that it’s a scam call. Hang up the call. Note that Lazada will never ask for your account details and never your OTP. By engaging with scammers, you may face unknown risks - one of which is validating your phone number.

i was introduced to this friend by my mother's friend for a job – the number (+60 1112198241) whereby one can earn commission by helping the seller to purchase order using a system that is auto generated and will match it according to the money that is deposited. To summarize – we are being issued orders within one click and will be intelligently matched orders and be earning non-stop commission. So firstly, had deposited SGD $300 into the account and we were instructed to paynow 98527515 and send a screenshot to the “Customer service” +65 85738125 and we will then receive an instruction to go into the app “Club Factory” and go to top up and then put in the amount that we had paynow to the person and include the screenshot in the app. So everything seemed fine when I had received 2 orders amounting to $899 which is insufficient as I had only topped up $300. Hence, I was told that the consecutive orders which are the 2 orders have to be completed in order to proceed and I had to top up $900 to complete the order and the money will be back into the system account and I can continue to proceed. To my surprise , I got a double order again and this time it amounts to $1099 and I had to top up another $1100 and I had to transfer to UOB 37039291?? REN ZENGSHA?? as I have to message the “Customer service” to get the account to transfer to always before sending the money. After the money was in the account, I continued and to my horror, 3 orders in a row came in together and amounting up to $1997 and this time round I had to top up $2000 and I was assured that having multiple orders is normal and the max is 3 orders. The orders started to get more and more expensive, and the person kept rushing me to find money to complete orders as there is a time limit to it. After which I requested for a refund/ withdraw and I want my money back total $2300 and the “Customer service” said it was unable to proceed with my request and couldn’t get back my money. After repeated request to withdraw, she said that she need to communicate with the seller and need to apply for me and keep making excuses till the point that I mentioned that I will be going to the police, she threatened me that if the company have any losses / damages I have to take responsibility as they will hire lawyers to sue me and the platform will fully cooperate with the police investigations as all transactions are being recorded down and there is an SOP that they are following.
It all started with Telegram when this lady called Sandy. She asked me if I want to work part time/ freelance. And it doesn't require interview. Then she referred me to her so call manager name Sin Ling. This is what she wrote:" This job does not require an interview and can be done on the computer or on the phone. If it is your first time we will provide a tutorial and it will only take 50minutes a day to complete the tasks and you will be able to withdraw your commission directly after completing all the tasks. The job is very simple, we are helping merchants/supplier to increase the visibility of their products, we are helping the products on the Target platform to increase their visibility and review rate, the company will give us 45 orders to complete each day to help company to increase their products and visibility, each day's to complete 45 orders, so the we need to sign up for an account on the work platform to work for 50 minutes per day, if you are interested I will explain more to you." For the first day I did receiver a $190 commission. The next day everything was different - the system kept increasing and I needed to top up more money to the account. Foolish me, thank God my husband stopped me from transferring money. I lost $20K thanks to these scammers. This is a hard lesson that I have learnt. I hope you all don't fall for this trap. They will be friendly to you but please don't be naive like me. Things don't come easy. You got to work hard for your money and don't ever fall for this trap. Hope the scammers get caught one day.

I received SMS and WhatsApp number from 85492187 asking whether do I need a part time job. Her name is Grace, she is under com-junction platform handling sales all over Singapore. This part time job can boost the sales of unsold products just grabbing items only, 38 of them and I can get some commission from it. She also send me a link web.com-junction.com.. After doing my 38 orders, there was a nego amount in the app, I need to top-up in order to receive my commission, and after I top up grace went missing. I was really panic and I made a police report. Not sure if I could recover my money.
It all started in 4 Nov 2021. One day a random message popped up on telegram. The person goes by the name of Jessica (no last name or full name given), and claims to be from glint interns looking for data analysis positions. Jessica claimed that you only need to work 2-3 hours a day and you can earn from $80. Thinking it might be an internship opportunity, I replied and said I was interested. I was redirected to WhatsApp and someone else claiming to be Jacky, who claimed to be from quartile. He had a +65 number so i feel more assured. He explained to me what the job does, said it was for 40 missions and help other companies promote their products. I initially expected it to be a data analysis job where I would be filling in spreadsheets, so i was a little confused by this. I asked him how long would one work daily he said just 30 minutes, and i was weirded out by the discrepancy. He gave me a website to sign up and I did not know what the trade password was, he said it was the password used to withdraw. The website looked nicely done but it felt suspicious because it was a html and i could not find much detail about the company online and has no headquarters in Singapore, so i had a suspicion that they might be from overseas, which is risky. The website was too suspicious for me since the website had no links to the official website and had different link domain from the official. When I clicked on some buttons the website just turned into some gibberish html with Chinese words in it which looks like people from china made it. Then I asked him what the company was about and he just told me a copy pasted thing from the official website. At this point i felt something was very wrong and declined his offer and he asked why. Ignoring him he attempted to call me but i declined and blocked him. Came here, I began to read many people were also caught in this incident so please beware.
I decided to share my story to raise awareness. I'm a homemaker looking for side income. I was contacted by a RECRUITER named ZOEY via TELEGRAM offering a freelance/part time JOB. He then passed my number to his colleague named Elise (87960029). She later explained that her company is hiring marketing part timers to increase visibility and view rate of products on platform. So I need to boost them by clicking 40 items to complete what they called a mission. Number of missions are randomised which culminated to 3 times of commission. I was given $20 credit to start, I earned $51 but later scammed $2700. I need to recharge via paynow for the missions to be completed to recover my initial capital. It got to a point where it is impossible to top up because it has reach a million! Crazy! And they even asked me to borrow from my friends to tide over the negative amount.
This guy called ‘Kane’ said hi on Instagram so I said “hi” back. He asked if I was Chinese and if we could speak in Chinese (i can’t). But anyhow we ended up talking on WhatsApp. He would send texts in Chinese, delete it then a whole paragraph in English. Kinda fishy (and fast). He claimed he’s from Taiwan and has family on mainland running a business. He claims he has a failed business of women’s shoes because his alleged partner spent 5.5b rmb at a casino in macao, so he helped to pay off the “debt”. He claims he’s the CEO of sg market. Anyhow, the conversation slowly moved to investments. He would subtly bring up how he has good investment ‘lobang’ from his ‘uncle’ and eventually asked me to go this platform - https://h5.jpmmx.com/ - now changed to - https://h5.jpmapi.top/ after you click it, it will be .xyz! The platform honestly looked poorly designed. So I told him no thanks. It looks a bit dodgy And, he started accusing me of framing him. He created an account for me and I went in to have a look Anw on the platform, he said to contact customer service if I wanted to deposit, min 500sgd. Well i didn’t and kept on changing topic / not replying, he started calling and pestering to invest and top up. Every time you ask what he’s doing. He’s looking at market data.. Reported the website already. Friends, look out for platforms like this!!!
Got a part time job recommendation by this lady tan Yixin. she claimed the task is to help merchant boost the sales of their product by grabbing/ clicking orders I need to pump in money to top up then once I had completed all 45 orders I can take back the money i pump and also take some commission, but if the figure showed negative and that meant meant that I need to top up money in order to continue.
I met this guy through Facebook dating app. He claimed that he is a pilot and American born Chinese but has poor English. One day, he told me he wants to visit me. When he reached airport, he texted me want to borrow $3000 dollars to pay as quarantine fee( i first time heard of this). I told him to stop all the nonsense and I am not going to pay for him.! If he wanted money, he should earn it from a proper way. Please be wary of such scams online. He is also using another profile name, Eric Chul. Never fall into such traps.
A person claiming to be from MOH called to inform i was guilty for sending 600 fake covid messages in china, shanghai, Chang sha road, #4600, on 25 October 2021, 2.48pm sg time. When I informed I was in Myanmar, he said I had been impersonated, then redirected me to 'shanghai police officers', first 'officer' by the name 'zhang yong sheng', and second 'officer' addressed himself as “Liu. They tried to interrogate me, claiming that 'pu xiao dong' is in cahoots with many banks and sg police, and many police stations such as that in Ang Mo Kio, Hougang and Sengkang are working alongside pu xiao dong. Forwarding 2 documents, first documenting unrest caused in china from the bank scam using my personal details to create bank card, to scam 17 old people in china under my name and details. Subsequently showed me a 'police statement' recording my information, so as to clear off 'false charges' lodged under moh. That i have to forward my personal particulars justifying my proof that i haven't set foot in china the recent 1-2 years, and I've been made to delete the documents they forwarded to me via WhatsApp. Also I was told to tear and flush the information I wrote down on paper into the toilet bowl. I was also told to report to him what i was doing every day, at 10am, 6pm and 11pm sg time, and to assist in investigation. All this happened when I just returned from Myanmar and am serving my 10-day quarantine at sdf. It happened on 1 November 2021, first call made by +6591020381 at 12.20pm sg time, and subsequently calls from +862150614567 (zhang yong sheng), +8615902841410 (zhang yong sheng) and +8617899119521 (Liu). Via WhatsApp video, a person in police uniform interrogated me. Subsequently I had to report my details to clear the charges. This is all a scam.
I received a call from an Indian using this no. +6596544414 claiming to be from Lazada and his name is KIM BUTCHOR. he said someone used my Lazada account from Germany to buy A very expensive perfume PERFUME LAST NIGHT and he needs to verify that it was not a valid purchase to help block and cancel the order,. to do so, I Am asked to give him the 6-digit verification code sent to my EMAIL from Lazada (which I realised after the fact that it was to change my password in Lazada!!). I gave him the verification code and he accessed my Lazada account and was able to share with me my purchases history and in fact triggered the perfume transaction using my account. After which, he claimed that he needed my bank card information to cancel the transaction and ask me for full card info and pin. I suspected it was a scam when he asked me for bank card number and pin and insisted that I will not be able to cancel the transaction if I call back later. I refused to give the pin and hung up the call while calling the bank at the same time to block card. Please be beware and these scammers getting smarter to get info out when we are not vigilant.
It happened just a few mins ago where an Indian man called and said want to confirm my order which I placed at Lazada last night. So I asked him what is my Lazada username he said unable to check and he said he gotten my name which he repeating, I said I do not need to know my own name. What is the credit card number you mentioned? And he started shouting and said I need to confirm your name and details and then he hung up the call.
I got a text message for an unsuccessful delivery attempt for SingPost Since i was expecting a delivery from SingPost I believed it it said my parcel was now at warehouse and if I wanted it to be delivered, I need to pay $2.98 When I made the payment, my credit card got charged for 2988.50, and it was made in Turkey Sharing this to help others.
An Indian man called from handphone number saying he is a Lazada staff and said someone ordered a iMac from Germany , so he needed a cancellation confirmation code from my Lazada account. Please be warned that there is such an ongoing scam!
Williams DM me on Instagram and we then move to line chat. Told me he is divorced Korean and on mission in Syria, has a 8 year old daughter. Professed his love for me after a few days; said want to marry me etc. Then one day, told me had terrorist attack and he was in danger, requested for me to email his general (email: generalmarkamilley96@gmail.com) to ask for permission to leave syria. I did that and this so-called general replied that would need a lot of money and asked for my personal details. Thereafter, I blocked Williams from both line and Instagram.
i met a guy on CMB. he was very friendly and seemed trustworthy. eventually he introduced Kqi to me because he "prove" to me that he was trustworthy and could help me earn money. I kept rejecting and we fought, but I eventually gave in due to "trust". initially, while using the app, the guy was guiding me and i was making small investments and was winning money. at this point, i could still withdraw my earnings. Then there was an event where I could win $1688 if i put in $20k. i did not want to play it but the guy persuaded me to do so, insisting that he had played it before and it was legitimate. he would also help me top up cash to build trust with me. After awhile, his and my account got frozen because we violated their "rules". in order to unfreeze it and get my money out, i had to put in 70% of my deposited money. of course, i panicked and quickly did so because they only gave me 48 hours. my account was finally unlocked, and i tried to withdraw all of it out. however, they then told me that because of mas anti-money laundering law, withdrawals &gt;40k will be taxed. if i do not pay the taxes within 3 business days, i would be taken to court. again, i panicked, not thinking to verify with mas, and deposited another $9911. my account was unlocked, however, I went from queue number 187, to 185, to 277. this was very suspicious to me. The guy who I was talking to was allegedly in the same predicament, and he even confirmed with his "brother-in-law", who had worked in the company as a technician before, that this has happened before and we would get our money back. but after putting in so much money and reading stories on scam alert, I woke up and affirmed that I would no longer be putting in money. I know I won't be able to get my money back and this was a painful life lesson that costed 60k. please, everyone out there, do not be so trusting and guilt tripped into an investment "love" scam.
I have received a call from a scammer, claiming to be from MOH and has an urgent matter to talk to me. It was an automated machine that spoke to me and this has happened to me twice. The contact number that contacted me is +6592838577. Upon hearing the robocall, I hung up.
I received a call from an Indian using this no. +6596163026 claiming to be from Lazada. he said someone used my Lazada account from Germany to buy an apple laptop and in order to cancel the order, I have to give him the 6-digit code in the SMS sent to my phone number from Lazada. I knew it was a scam already when he ask for the code. so after giving him a few wrong codes, he asked me for my bank and card number so he could refund me the money. I tried to entertain him longer but he hung up after I kept diverting the question on my card number.
1) Caller claimed she was from "SingTel" and said that my home internet was attacked by malicious 3rd parties/other websites. I was instructed to follow their instructions to log on to a website in order to remove these website attacks. they hung up after I said I would report to the police
"Encountered person from flip dating app (username: chen), claiming to be a Taiwanese living in Singapore with her auntie and uncle for the past 4 to 5 years. She wanted to switch to WhatsApp (profile picture of a merlion; initial WhatsApp username: tiffany lewis; edited to "c.f.c") to chat. First mentioned 'myrtles platform' then asked if I wanted to join her in her crypto ventures (scalping). Rejected her and she tried to lure me in with a screenshot of her transactions, showing daily deposits from 5 to 6 figure sums. She also sent me a screenshot of her DBS mobile app, indicating a balance of sgd190,219.77 in her DBS multiplier account. Later, when asked what platform she used, she mentioned coinhako. Upon scrolling through her photos in her flip profile, realised that they are of a celebrity (ig: charmainexhui), given that I recognized the celebrity's father being a TVB actor from Hong kong. When asked about her identity, baking business venture and name, she got extremely defensive and aggressive after i sent her the celebrity's ig url. When probed on her finances, she feigned that she was busy and blocked me subsequently.I reported the user on the app and have not received a response as of yet.
Received a text telegram text message by Maria lee offering part-time job. Agreed to give her my number so employer can give more details over WhatsApp. She goes by evon (90423961) but her bank detail name was tan Qian Ying (9192 4281). Diff hp number quite bizarre to me. Ask to 'grab' orders then can get 30% commission off Evon acct to use as 'capital' for my accnt. Must grab 45 orders on my acct too then can withdraw everything. Eventually u hit an order where u need to top up your own money to complete it. Supposed to get everything back after u fulfil the order. The more money u start with the more u end up needing to top up bc you'll get larger orders. I played along while suspicious of it day 1 only needed to top up $50 total got back everything + commission. Day 2 hit an order to top up $600 did not do so. Tried to bypass the system by earning more 30% commission but was told by Evon the negative balance will not be cancelled off by new incoming commission. They add you into a chat grp where everyone shares their withdrawal/profit to gain your trust early on then put you in a position where u have to top up more and more. Eventually you'll fail to withdraw and lose everything. Had a friend who lost 10k to smth similar which is why I was on high alert from the start. Thankfully, didn’t lose any money hope everyone is more aware and alert so they don't fall for such scams.Editor's Note: If you received such messages, report and block the contact. DO NOT respond and DO NOT 'play along". The money that you receive in the first few payouts could be illegal proceeds from other victims.
Somebody called me in WhatsApp from the number +65 8900 3083 and claimed to be from the Singapore police. Even they had their WhatsApp profile as Singapura polis logo, just to make us believe. They said nowadays there are so many frauds are happening, so they are replacing everyone's debit card and they wanted me to tell my card details. Since it was evident from their language and sound, I didn't disclose any details and I had to cut the call since I got another important call. Obviously I have not provided any information, however I just want alert others also about this scam number.
There was a phone call to my phone today, 1 Nov at 12.51pm from this number 65-9475140?. After I said hello, there is an automated voice that say it is from High Court (in engligh followed by Mandarin). I hung up immediately and block the number. There is another similar automated call from MOH about queries on vaccines a few days back on 27 Oct 4.24pm from 65-9340861?.
I was contacted through Telegram by Shanelle (@shanelleloh) on 26 October and Fannie goh (@fanniegoh96) on 28 October who claimed to be from sg recruiter, saying that they are currently hiring different department freelance p/t. I replied to Fannie and she asked for my contact details. I provided my contact number and jess contacted me through whatsapp. Jess introduced herself as Jessye (+65 86468178) and explained that they work with CJ affiliate to optimize data to bring good ratings and word of mouth to all types of businesses, it takes 30-50 minutes a day to optimize the data. She also said that for every data I optimised, I would get $0.30 to $15, I can earn up to $90-$270 a day for clicking 45 orders. She let me use her account to complete the first 45 data and i will get 30% commission upon completion. She guided me to their website (https://www.cja-ffiliate.life/index/user/register) to register an account with an invitation code. As a start, she transferred money using her own bank account to the account provided. Once the money has been top up, she told me to click on start making money, start grabbing orders and click submit for 45 orders. While doing, i encountered an error which did not allow me to proceed as there were insufficient funds and it is showing a negative amount. She told me that she has to recharge and i will get the bank account from customer service again. After I completed 45 orders, I screenshot and sent to her. She told to check the commission in my account and complete the 45 orders in my account. I did the same and transferred a total of $60. While I was doing halfway, the site crashed. I told Jessye about it and she told me to check with customer service, I was told the site was under maintenance. I was given a new website thereafter. After I completed my 45 orders, she taught me how to withdraw money. I withdrew a total of $224. Jessye added me to a WhatsApp group with 13 people.It seems like an easy job earning so much just by clicking. I introduced this job to my friend and got her to do the same. However, the amount of money she has to top up is more than mine. We felt that it was strange transferring to top up the funds as the funds in the account just kept increasing after we submit to grab items which doesn’t make sense. We went online to search more about this and learnt that someone she knew was cheated $7k. At the end of the day even though we have nothing to lose we decided to stop. Jessye texted me a few times yesterday asking if I’m free to work again. I did not reply her and I was removed from the Whatsapp group today. Jobs with easy money may seem like a breeze but there are consequences to it. Editor's Note: Do not take up job offers that sound dubious. The "commission" that the victims received in the few occasions might be illegal proceeds, taken from other victims. If you received such job offers, ignore, block and share the information here: https://www.police.gov.sg/I-Witness.
I almost got scammed on October 21st. Received an external +65 number call claiming to be from a online shopping company LAZADA ( should have caught them by saying let me call you back) mentioning there was a transaction the day before from " Malaysia KL" for an apple ipad pro and camera and wanted to know if I had made the transaction. I told the person I did not. The caller identified himself as Eric Lang LAZADA ID 346189 and said I can call the company to verify. He then said to cancel the transaction the company is sending an OTP. I received the OTP at that time. He then asked me to give the the number as they want to use this number to block the transaction. I began saying the first number of the OTP when noticed the OTP message stated do not share even with LAZADA. I then questioned them and he said that he will transfer me to his superior to explain. He then said the company had called me to prevent the fraud but I was not cooperating so he said he can proceed to approve the transaction. I then told him are you threatening me? I then asked him to confirm his name and ID but he was keeping on talking about transferring the call. I cut the line. I then checked with LAZADA on how I got the LAZADA OTP and they mentioned that what would have happened is the scammer would have tried to log into my account and asked to reset the password. If I had given them the OTP, they would have taken over my account, changed the Mobile number and begin to use my card linked to the account. I confirmed with LAZADA service person that I did not give the OTP to the scammer. (Also recommend to make the ATM card linked to a secondary account and keep a minimum amount there so in the worst case only that minimum amount would be lost.) The scammer was mentioning the so called "KL person" would get access to the my bank account. I believe of I would have given the OTP to them they would then try the next step to access internet bank account as they can see my ATM card number from LAZADA account using the same trick. I had watched phone scam on crimewatch which helped me recognize this scam. Thank God He helped me not be scammed! Today I received another +65 call claiming to be from Lazada to which I said I do not think you are from Lazada and the caller promptly hung up.
This person called me under the pretense of a Lazada customer service officer and wanted to check in on my Lazada account. However, I do not have a Lazada account at all and I mentioned this to the officer before he abruptly cut the line. I am concerned that this number will scam actual Lazada customers in Singapore.
Beware! Scammer called to get 6 digit verification code for resetting Lazada account password. Lazada will never request their users for this. Caller was an Indian man. From what I heard from the background noise, he seemed to be calling from a call center located in India. Please do not share any personal info to this scammer. Fortunately, i did not share any info with him and nothing was lost from my side. Beware of such impersonation phone calls.
Received missed call from this suspicious number. profile picture was the symbol of Ministry of Manpower. when I called back, caller said he was from Ministry of Manpower Singapore, despite having a foreign accent. I asked him why he had a number that started with +1 and not +65 and he refused to reply. Then I asked why he called and he asked me if I had one or two doses of covid-vaccine already done. He hung up after I probed further.
Caller mentioned she is from Lazada and I have made a order of iphone 12 from Germany and need VERIFICATION code to decline the order if this as not placed by me. I hung Up the call and checked with Lazada And found out this is a scam. Here is the caller Number: +65 9643 378? Editor's Note: We wish to share that if an incoming call comes with "+" prefix it means that it originates from overseas. If you are not expecting any overseas phone calls, do not pick up or treat the call with extra caution.
Initially it started off from telegram, and she said she was from Hay recruit and clevertap. Apparently these two companies were working together and when I did search for the company it look legit. She told me I could do a data analysis job which can be done from home. It intrigued me but I did not give much thought. Unfortunately, I gave in to try a week later. Basically, I have to boost 40 missions and luck or not, have to pay for any negative balance. I was such a fool when this was clearly not a data analysis job :') Long Story short within two days, I have lost 2.3k. It may not look much because many others may have lost more compared to me. I have already made a police report and since that day cancelled my bank account and stopped using my old number. What I have learnt: Easy money is never easy and could have easily came from anywhere. Please get a job with a contract, face to face with that individual and have some Background with legitimate information about the Company. Heck go and consult with your friends or FAMILY members. If your eel that you are alone, you are definitely not! Voice out and share! The least we can do is to prevent and share with others about this SCAM!
Be aware of freelance job scams, which involves increasing the popularity boosting of online products, in my case was on shopback site. One has to click 40 items to complete what they called a mission. The number of missions is randomised, which culminated to 3 times of one’s online commissions. One is given $20 credit to start. I “ earned “ $69 on day one but was scammed of $4018 on day two. The number of missions on shopback site will keep increasing and one needs to recharge via paynow when there is a negative in the wallet. One will be tempted to keep topping up, in order to try to recover one’s initial capital. It got to a point where it is impossible to top up. I was included in a group chat and one of the members even suggested that i can consider either borrowing money or pawn my belongings just to tide over the negative amount. I then made a police report accordingly. The scammers are simply heartless, scheming and professional. The jobsdb on telegram seemed legit until it became a deleted account. My suspicion was further confirmed after I was removed from the WhatsApp group. Please never trust that money cannot come so easily., terrible lesson learnt, all the sites seemed legit.
I received a telegram message from Blaire Yen @mynameisblaireeyen, asking me if I wanted part time job to which i agreed. She then had asked for my number to be referred to another person who would share with me more about the job scope. I provided the person with my contact and was contacted later by a person called annie at +65 88060576 via WhatsApp. She claimed to be working for big-commerce and asked me to go to a website https://www.bcp-rojec.com/ (their platform) and register an account. That platform only required for name, password and phone number. Annie then explained to me how to do the job which is to grab order that comes in. Every order that comes in I have to click on grab and sometimes the balance would turn negative as I was informed that it was a package order, which I have to top up cash to make it back to 0, paid to the merchant. This is to complete one order an there is about 40 orders per set. Only after completing the set, I will be able to receive the money (commission). In total, I had completed 2 sets and received commission (which bought my trust). I was sucked in and went on with the 3rd set, which halfway through the cost of items was too much and i could not afford it. (regardless I was not going to get back the money...) The customer service continued to prompt/threaten me to complete the order or my account will be frozen. I was stressed and surrendered to it at that moment... I have lost a total of s$26,600/- p.s. After reading all of these stories, i decided to share mine. The post trauma from this episode is life-changing.i cannot imagine what the other victims have to go through from such scams. I hope everyone can be well informed of such DISGUSTING SCHEMES OUT THERE, AND LEARN FROM from mistakes.
I was introduced to a guy by the name of Joshua who told me that I can earn money by downloading apps from voodoo gaming. I was going to earn around $5-$8.88 per job. Joshua told me that voodoo gaming has a long queue of people waiting. He asked if I would like to try another way of making money. He gave me his credentials to sign in to ebay-nicegoods.com, and proved to me that he only needed to recharge thrice with a small amount and he could get back his money. All it needed was for us to complete 60 orders, and we could withdraw the wallet amount with principal sum and commission.I introduced the website to my sister that night, thinking it was legitimate.I tried putting in $5,000 at the start. At the 16th order, I realised that had to top up $9,000+ to my wallet to continue receiving orders. Afraid that i will have to do more big recharges, with the fact that the recharge amount is so high, found it suspicious and stopped.My sister invested $1,500 at the start. She made about 8 recharges thereafter. The amount she has invested into this website is $53,000. She made the recharges thinking she could simply finish making the 60 orders and get her money back.Instead, at the 57th order, her wallet balance showed negative $35,000+. She needed to top up this amount to continue finishing the 3 orders. She got suspicious because there was no guarantee that she could finish up the 60 orders without further recharge.These people claimed to be from e-bay Singapore, merchants who wanted to give people commission to boost their sales value. But, upon investigation and our persistent hounding, they did not provide any proof that they were from ebay. All questions about who they were glossed over.I spent the entire day trying to get back my money from the chatbox provided in the website. Kelly ooi claimed that we could surrender the wallet but pay 50% penalty.This was not told to us beforehand, and we did not want to be paying $30,000 for nothing. Upon further negotiation, she mentioned the penalty could be lowered to 18%. We were so exhausted that we wanted to close the case and go with this 18% penalty (a loss of $10,800 for nothing).However, she later told us that she cannot process the refund, citing that we need to give back 18% then the wallet will refund back to us. This did not make any sense because we don't even have anymore money in our wallet.Please beware about ebay-nicegoods.com (Note: Scam site, do not click) it is a scam and we are unsure if we can get our money back. The person from the chat was even so arrogant as to tell us to lodge a police report, and that they would cooperate with the police. But when we asked for their details, they mia-ed.
I met this girl from Facebook dating by the name of chew as the username, said to be a Malaysian, working in Redmart warehouse. The bio matches and seems quite legit for the most part. We moved on quickly to WhatsApp and chatted. Things seems to go pretty smoothly; we share many common interest. But me being skeptical, I had done my due diligence to do image reserve lookup and searching social media for her name, but found nothing more about this person. So I felt safe to continue but with a cautious mind, we chatted for 2 days. As and when she would mention that she was doing a “part time” job with Zalora to help boost its online search engine optimization. As someone who is in the it industry I felt something fishy, but I am not exposing her yet. For one I really felt some connection between us. Only until she asked for a small favour from me, to help complete her “part time” job with Zalora so that she could meet me on the weekends. I agreed with cautious… Moment later, she sent me a phone number and a sentence of text to send to that number though WhatsApp. The text to send was, “Zalora customer service, referrer was, Ng Rui Xin”. Once sent, a series of reply returned with some Chinese words and badly structured sentences/grammar. This was the red light for me. I immediately told her i felt uncomfortable and sorry that I couldn’t help with her “part time” job. Thereafter she got really mad and said she thought she found someone sincere and all those trying to make me guilty words. But I said “bye bye” to her, block and report in WhatsApp. To all singles out there on dating app, proceed every step carefully. Practise zero trust. Even if you have met them a few times.
I met this scammer nana over michat. she gave me her contact number. We contacted via WhatsApp. I was asked to meet her on 27 October 2021 at yishun ave 5 (7-11 store). When i reached 10? Yishun Ave 5, I was requested by nana to purchase a card from the AXS machine. I told nana that i would not purchase anything. After nana heard what I had said, she got agitated and told me to go and die and used four profanity letter words to scold my mum and tell her to die. Also Nana asked my whole family to go and die. I told her to mind her words. After hearing what I said to nana, she send me a video of a guy being slashed by another person with blood coming out from his hand. Kindly beware of such scammers.
Job scam. The first few transactions everything went smoothly till the last one I transferred $499 and they said system rebate failed and asked me to redo the payment. That's when I realised I got scammed.
I’m am writing to share details of a scam I encountered online. I responded to a part time job ad on “quest” an adhoc job portal app. I expressed interest and was was requested to reach out to a “Leona”- who was the in charge of the daily jobs. Initially, she requested for me to click on 50 online orders a day through an online platform. At the end of the day, I will receive a withdrawal commission. I received a payment of $370.Subsequently, the clicking required me to deposit amounts in order to fulfil the 50 orders. However, when I deposited the amount and hit 50 orders, I was not allowed to withdraw the money and as my total assets exceeded 15k. I had to upgrade to a level 2 member, hitting 60 orders in order to withdraw my funds.I decided that I will not deposit any money further and requested to close my account. I made a final “force refund deposit” in order to close my account. When I had done so, they told me that there was an error and the money could not be with drawn.
I was first approached on telegram by someone named Alicia asking if I am looking for flexible part time job and to message her back if I am interested to find out more. So i ask her for more details and she told me to provide her my contact number as someone else will WhatsApp me further on the details of the job scope, i gave her my number thinking that no harm to find out more about the details since no obligations. A while later, someone by the name Joline messaged me on WhatsApp and immediately explained to me the job scope. Job scope: A job that require us to help merchants to boost their viewing rate and visibility to increase sales and traffic on the online shopping. tutorial will be provided. It takes 20-30 mins per day to complete 45 tasks and can withdraw commission directly after completing all tasks. (sounds like a good deal... however...) She proceeded saying i will be registering an account by using her invitation code so that we both will get commissions when we grab orders. (at this point it lured me in to give it a try since she say tutorial). She went on teaching me how to grab orders in the platform and there were a few large orders (which means more commissions earned, triple the commission) and having to transfer a certain amount into the online shopping platform to continue grabbing orders. (Also the online platform that they told me to register an account with is target...) After this tutorial, she asked me to try it on my own (complete 45 orders). I started grabbing small orders until I hit a large order (triple commission) and they asked me to transfer $43 first, subsequently on my next grab of order, i chanced upon another large order (triple commission) and asked me to transfer another $13. (i was at my 25 order or so). by now, i felt something was not right but i was told that i had to continue to complete my orders in order to take back the amount i transferred into the platform and the commissions earned from grabbing. After completing all orders, she then went through with me the steps on how to withdraw my commissions earned that day. in total I withdraw $185 which included the amount I put into the platform ($53) and commissions earned that day ($132). That is when i stopped as I felt very uncomfortable to continue. I just want to share my story and bring awareness to others of this ongoing situation that happened to me about a week ago. (also decided to share my story after seeing many others posted a similar story as mine). Hopefully others will be more alert if they encounter this in the future. Editor's note: We would like to advise that users do NOT take up any unsolicited job offers. Victims may receive commissions in the first few rounds but scammers will disappear after victims put in a larger sum to complete the tasks. We would also like to share that the 'commissions' that users receive from scammers may be illegal proceeds that came from other victims.
A man called my hp on 25 Oct 2021 at 8.15pm. He called me by my name and said that his purpose of the call is to let me know that he has changed his hp number. His hp number is +6594269677. I asked him for his name and he kept asking me to guess. I refused to give any names. He then said he can give me some hints. He said he is a bit plump and just spoken to me recently. He kept prompting me:" You don't know my name? How can you forget me? GUESS MY NAME.". I TOLD HIM I DON'T KNOW and just tell me who he is. He said his name is tony and he will send me a whatsapp message so that I know who he is. Then he just put down the phone. I don't KNOW anyone NAMED tony. In the end, the man also DId not send me any WhatsApp messenge.
met this lady named Judy on Facebook dating app on 19 oct 2021. We proceeded to whatsapp (Mobile number 88021142) and spoke for 2 days and everything seems fine and she gained my trust that she is a legit potential date. she mentioned she is working a side job for zalora by helping to make purchases in advance and receive 5% commission from the merchant. the commission and principal amount will be transferred be to me immediately after my transfer. she mentioned that she needs to complete 50 orders a day and appreciated that i could help her complete some of it. Finally, I agreed to help her out and was given another number by Judy she claimed was the ZALORA customer service. The first 3 jobs were small amount and I was given the refund and commission immediately. Then the issue comes when i was asked to transfer an amount for the item worth $1367. I made the transfer and this time the money was not returned to me. This time the customer service told me that I was supposed to transfer FOR 3 PIECES OF THE SAME item (total $4101) I believed the customer service and transfer the BALANCE amount ($1367 X 2 = $2734) BUT WAS TOLD THAT I DID NOT INFORM THEM BEFORE I TRANSFERRED AND THE SYSTEM DID NOT CAPTURE THE TRANSACTION. I was told to transfer ANOTHER $2734 and CAME BACK SAYING THIS IS A DOUBLE ORDER AND I ONLY COMPLETED THE OTHER ORDER AND TRANSFERRED ANOTHER ($1367 X 3 = $4101) LASTLY THEY TOLD ME MY ACCOUNT IS FROZEN AND I NEED TO COMPLETE ANOTHER ORDER FOR A G-SHOCK WATCH THAT COST $4900 IN ORDER TO UNFREEZE THE ACCOUNT. BY THEN I REALISED That I GOT SCAMMED and I made a trip down personally to the police station to report the case. AFTER THE INCIDENT, I READ STORIES HERE aND FOUND the STORY TITLED "I LOST OVER $12K TO A JOB SCAM", posted on 06 oct 2021, had similarities with my encounter. i noticed the method of operation is similar (i.e. met scammer by the name of judy through Facebook, e-commerce related (Zalora vs qoo-10), first 3 jobs being successful to bait the victim onto the scam.) the only difference is the mobile number used (91487476 VS 88021142). there may be a possibility that it could be the same scammer operating on 2 different mobile numbers or 2 different scammers working for the same syndicate. the account used to receive the funds from victims (BANK ACCOUNT NO. OCBC 5277061783; BANK ACCOUNT NAME: S.RAMANATHAN ) maybe "money mules" working for the syndicate.
I got to know this guy by the name of en from the dating app "happn". He was very friendly and initiated several calls to build relationship, before finally asking me to help him do an investment using the app named 凯基KGI. He gave me a third party link to download the app, and showed me how he can earn money using his account. Thereafter he got me to register for my own and began asking me to deposit more cash so that i can get more returns. I started with $200 and i eventually deposited $5k as i grew more confident.At this point, he got me to participate in an event by the app, whereby if i deposited $30k in 3 days, i would receive an additional $1688. He informed me that he participated in the event as well. However, the next day i was informed by the app's help desk that if i do not deposit 30k, i would not be able to withdraw from my account which had 6k at that point in time. Thus, i quickly deposited 15k and en "helped" me with 15k. Thereafter i was told to make an investment before i can withdraw my money. While making that investment, i was informed that my account is frozen because i had violated the app's regulations. In order to unfreeze the account, i would have to deposit another 15k. Feeling very stressed and confused, i called my friend to borrow money and told him about what had happened. Only then i realized i had been scammed. The numbers used by en: +65 84468801 +65 88594534 +65 93490991 he used the last 2 numbers to whatsapp me after i've blocked him. 凯基 KGI helpdesk number: +852 95592024
Scammer send an SMS message phishing as from Singpost. The sms message showed up in the same SMS thread as Singpost messaging. The SMS message: "your parcel has been redirected to your local post office branch due to an unpaid delivery fee. Visit here: https://bit.ly/3geqbw8" (NOTE: Phishing link. Do NOT click)This will link you to scammer's website that requests you to input your credit card number and all personal details, which obviously is a scam. Be careful: 1) do not click any unknown link. 2) do not reveal personal or credit card details. 3) do not pay for things you did not order.
I was contacted on Telegram by a user named Wendy with a "flexible part-time job" offer that claims to pay $180-$220 daily. Although I was not seriously nor actively seeking a job, I asked about the job description, and the party replied that she will assign a colleague to get in touch with me on WhatsApp (since she already has my number). Soon after, I received a message from +65 8105 4717 who goes by the name of May. Quoting her, the job is as follows: "What we want to do is boost mission, boost mission of helping the product to on CleverTap have good data to increase popularity of that product so more people purchase it etc, Do you need to know about it?" "For boost one mission you will get $0.52-$8.52. So perday you may earn $80-120.Every day you can boost 40 missions, and you can withdraw money on the platform after completing 40 missions" "this is the registration link of the platform for the job www.myclevertap.life (note: Scam website. Do NOT click) Invitation code D4JGF3" "This is my WhatsApp group, they all my agents and you can join and chat or if Im busy you can ask them https://chat.whatsapp.com/Fs6fSU3eqsp0CIXkCx9XUF" "Now I will use your invitation code to register an account and then you can login to my account to learn the operation and process first" "And you help my account boost mission you can also earn 20% commission" I was skeptical from the start, but registered an account on the CleverTap platform nonetheless just to take a look, and noticed that the platform requires "recharge" amounts before one is able to start 'boosting' any 'mission'. It was clear that this is a scam similar to others shared on this platform, and i backed out immediately. I had not lost any money nor personal information beyond my contact number, but would like to share this experience and the party's contact number before others fall for this scam, especially since people may be desperate to find a job this period.
I was approached on telegram with a job offer, which i accepted and another lady whatsapp me regarding the job. Gave me a website address and guided me through. Once registered, i was asked to do 45 orders on her account for about 30 minutes and was paid $120 commission. I was then asked to do the same amount of orders on my own account which required me to top up 3 times amounting to a total of $63. End of the order, i have $188 in my account which I was able to withdraw $100 due to withdrawal limit to denomination of 100. Next day i did the same, however putting in bigger amount multiple times, till its beyond my means. Turning to family for money, then only to realize that this is a scam and there is police news report in may 2021 on such scams/cheats. A total of $13622.59 was lost. I hope this serves a reminder to everyone that there is no easy money.
The call came in and it was an automatic voixe message telling me there was an urgent message by ministry of health , as i was serving my stay home notice this sounded legitimate. i should have been suspicious when there was only one option to press- it told me that if i had been vaccinated please press 3. which i did, then the line rang for a while and a person responded in chinese saying “喂？” i knew from experience this is a scam already, the early options were all in English why would someone respond to my call in chinese? i deliberately replied in English - hello??! then the guy quickly hang up. I have had several of such calls over many years and they always follow the same pattern to impersonate a government or official body, like ica/ police/ dbs bank / singtel/ dhl etc. and this time they use MOH due to the current climate of covid. Please be wary of such calls !
i chanced upon this furniture page on facebook called Homez furniture. i checked that this brand isselling on shopee and lazada with great reviews so i went ahead to order. Unffortunately i did not realise that the page is not the official page. it is however more popular than the official page. The payment was requested to be made to a ocbc account. it is only when i accidentally shared the post with homez sg - they then inform me that they are the official page. i have made a police report, homez sg has also informed affected customers to do the same. Editor's note: Please check if the FB page you are visiting is genuine. Look for tthe blue-tick beside the profile's to verify if you are on the authentic FB page, or google the company's website and enter the FB page from the company's website.
Someone called me on this mobile number and said he was from Singtel and someone was hacking my data. i first told him im under starhub and he still persisted saying that they are a part of the cybersecurity team and they need more information from me. I then asked why he was calling on a personal mobile number instead of singtel's official number and he hung up
Received a call stating that she is from Lazada. Indian lady, background sounded like a call centre. She said that i had ordered an expensive camera on Lazada and my account could have been hacked/compromised. She verified with my email address and said that in order to stop the processing of this order, I will need to verify the 6 digit OTP she sent to my handphone. It actually showed as a text from Lazada. But note that that email link given is suspicious as lzd.co. I checked my Lazada account but i do not see any orders on it. I've got suspicious and requested for an email to be sent. Thankfully, the email took longer than necessary to reach me. I did not receive the email and told her that i am concerned on her request on the OTP and that the email did not arrive, therefore i will call her customer support if there has been a breach while I check on my end. Her last ditch efforts was that Lazada will not bear any responsibility for any loss if I did not accept her assistance at that point of time. After the call, called up Lazada customer support and verified that was an impersonation scam. That was when I started to receive the fake Lazada emails to reset my account with the OTP. The fake Lazada email address is noreply@support.lazada.sg. Was a bit lost to find out I was almost scammed and at first wasn’t sure what to do. You may also file a police report either at the police station or via the Singapore police force website. Before doing so, be sure to collect all information regarding the scam before reporting it. Such information can include screenshots of conversations, transaction details including bank account details, or phone numbers of the scammer if possible. The police will investigate the matter. For e-commerce scams, you may report any suspected scammers to the platform administrator, who may be able to assist. If you suspect that you are a victim of a scam, end communications and do not reveal your personal information. Keep records or screenshots of all conversations to keep as evidence. HOPE THIS HELPS ANY ONE THAT ENCOUNTER THEM IN FUTURE.
a lady, wen ying reached out to me on telegram with the following messages. "Hi 👋🏻 i am from Morgan McKinley Singapore ,We are currently offering a freelance pt job , are you interested ?" "May i have your WhatsApp number? My manager will contact you for further details and company info ya ....then you may decide after listening" "🅱coz we have different departments now so depends on my manager what she offered you" "Good afternoon, Do you still interested in part time job? I can pass your WhatsApp to my manager and she will send the job details and salary for you" and without my approval or permission, she sent my information to her 'manager', who messaged me on WhatsApp. her name is Yeehui. Yeehui's and my conversation went on got quite a while, but what she sent was similar to the scam jobs that are mentioned here. "The job is very simple, we are helping merchants to increase the visibility of their products, we are helping the products on the Target platform to increase their visibility and review rate, the platform will give us 45 orders to complete each day to help merchants to increase their products and visibility, each day's to complete 45 orders, so the we need to sign up for an account on the work platform to work for 30 minutes to 1 hour per day, if you are interested I will explain more to you". "For boost one order you will get $0.30-$15 So per day you may earn $90-$270 Every day you can boost 45 orders, and you can withdraw money on the platform after completing 45 orders". She did not mention that I need to charge money at all initially, until I registered an account and realised that it was similar from the Uspeed technology ut app (which I was scammed before). then I asked her if I was required to top up money in it. "Before the platform can start grabbing orders, a minimum of $50 top-up is required to start grabbing orders." "After you complete 45 orders for me, you will receive 25% commission of my earnings. After you get my commission, you don't need to deposit capital to start grabbing orders on the platform. Then you can earn your own income while grabbing orders!" I knew it was a scam from the previous posts that were posted here, which I am extremely thankful for. just to let you all know, they are still actively looking for people to do these 'jobs'. after rejecting her, telling her that "I see, I’ve went through this kind of job before honestly. And was scammed $3K off it. I would definitely not put money in to do jobs anymore. I apologise for your time.", she was on guard and asked if I misunderstood the platform. Regardless, I would not give in to it and hope everyone can benefit from my post. thank you.
Got a call from this personal number saying that I got a notice from MOH Singapore and ask me to press "3". I ended the call and lookup on the MOH website and this number is not listed.
A person claimed to be caller from the Health Ministry from China. Required me to speak in Mandarin. He knows my name, but didn't pronounce in actual Chinese, and probably got my phone number from many major database leaks in the past. He stated that I have another phone number registered with my name in China which has been reported to be used for spamming. I ended the call thereafter as I found it ridiculous for a Chinese authority to call a resident in Singapore.
I received an SMS telling me that something was wrong with my bank account. Didn't click on the link as it looked like a typical phishing SMS. Want to share this to warn fellow residents to be wary of such scam attempts!
Scammers have been working really hard these days, this is the 3rd one i encountered this month! Received an SMS from sgpost today, informing that an attempted delivery of parcel failed. Clicking on the link will direct you to a legit looking singpost website prompting personal information and credit card details to pay for postage. A dead giveaway would be the strange url website. As the festive season is just round the corner, scams will be getting more rampant so please stay vigilant and do not give them a chance to celebrate x'mas at your expense.
I matched with this guy on a dating app (paktor) and we started chatting. The conversation slowly led to investments and he showed me screenshots of an investment platform and his profits from it. He then introduced me to the said investment platform, h5.tpg-base.xyz (Note: Fake investment site. DO NOT click) and asked me to register and call the customer service hotline. I was then directed to deposit the minimum sum ($500) though a bank transfer to an individual's bank account. They also allocated a secretary to communicate with me via LINE app on queries which I had. Meantime, the guy was constantly reinforcing through messages that he had profited through investing on the platform. Initially, I was able get back my deposit. subsequently, I was not able to as they asked me for (18k) tax to withdraw the money which I refused. The guy accused me of taking his money, and asked me to return him. Conclusion: I found out the photos he sent are false and the picture he had of himself is actually someone else which I search through google reverse image. he is smart and play with your psychology to gain your trust to make the investment. This happened in oct/2021. Loss of $1000.
Met multiple guys on the dating platform. Firstly, they will sweet talk to you say what you beautiful, want get together. Then after days of talking, they would introduce you a website for cryptocurrency investment, they will also screenshot some proof that they earned money. The platform introduced was something I never even seen before, hence i was v against it and ask if I could use my own platform. Then he tried to persuade me, but to no avail, hence he stopped talking to me after that. I was so against it because i got scam before by another guy. (both of them communicate in Chinese). That one was a betting website, and he say that he got some ways to earn money, so at first all the small wins, then one day he ask me sign up for a event, to earn the bonus which i did but the money never come back. Lost a total of 20k. Name: gao yu &amp; devin. Please be aware and don’t trust people online so easily
Called on 20/10/2021 at 1030am. She says she is from SingTel and is a technician. She says my internet line is being compromised and many people are using my internet. She wants to help to check. Many people are also facing the issue of slowness because of that. She asked if I was facing slowness in the internet last few days and I told her my internet has not been slow. When I asked for authentication she says she has my SingTel customer id. I asked her for her name and contact so that i can call back after verifying my customer ID but she could not give my customer id and then hang up. I tried calling back 68268862 and no one picks up
This person called said that he is my friend and he lost his mobile. Hence, update me that this is his new number. He told me that he started a business - a new cafe in town and invite me to his new cafe this Saturday. The next day, he called and ask me for a loan to pay for his supplier because he lost his wallet as well and he needed time to replace all his documents so he cants transfer money to the supplier. As such, he asked me to transfer money on his behalf. I called my friend's old number and realised is a scam.Please do be alert and do not fall prey to such impersonation scams!
At 9.13m a call from +6585705861. Informed me that I might be exposed to covid but the authority tried to contact me twice but failed. Ask me press 3 so someone can explain to me. It was robocall in English follow by Mandarin. I was worried that it is a scam as the newspapers has reported that notification ls are done by SMS, I hung up immediately and waited 10 min to call back. Found out that the number was an invalid number. Editor's Note: Please be wary of incoming phone calls with a "+" prefix as this is an indication that the call originates from overseas. If you are not expecting overseas phone calls, do not answer or if you choose to answer, treat the call with extra caution.
Someone on telegram approached me. She told me she was from sg recruiters group - “we are currently offer a freelance pt job, are you interested?” I thought it was legit so I agreed to link up with the poc - Jolin. Jolin texted me and went through the “job” with me. It happened last Friday and i was added into a group with 9 other people. Initially, Jolin shared these info with me:“we are helping merchants boost visibility &amp; viewing rate, so here's how we do it i'll tell you briefly. The merchant finds the company, finds the agency, which means the merchant pays the company, the company pays us, and we help the merchants boost visibility &amp; viewing rate of their products” i helped her with her purchase every day to get 25% of her commission. I was later asked to register the account with my own personal information. She shared i had to grab 45 order daily, both on her account and mine. After a day of completing the orders, I realised the orders were bulking up to a larger amount and it require constant top up. By then, I realised something isn’t right and pulled out from it. Although I did not lose any money. But the way, this goes viral and how “easy” the money was said to be earned can really cause detrimental damage in a long run.
On 9 October, a women named josephine approached me on telegram asking if i'm interested in a home-based part-time job. She re-directed me to whatsapp to speak with her colleague Alyssa (+65 9427 8348). Alyssa gave me an explanation on what the company does and even provided me a legitimate company website. The job scope involved taking orders to help boost the visibility of merchants on varied e-commerce platforms. She guided me with the account registration on their website (fusionex.online). Initially i was skeptical about it, but after trying it with her account, i was convinced. For the first two times, i succeed in withdrawing my capital along with the promised commission. But when i did for the third time on 10 oct, things went south. The orders requires me to constantly recharge an amount before i could continued, and the amount kept increasing. In total i recharged 8 times hopping to get my capital back. The tipping point was when the website required me to recharge another $30,000 when i have already put in $33,500. I texted the so-called customer service (+65 8010 0483) asking to replace the order with a lower amount so that i could complete the remaining 6 task to withdraw my capital. The customer service person by the name of ammar bakhtiar (acc no. 713553394001; +65 8895 6937) told me that the orders were randomised and he has no control over it. He told me not to cause any trouble and they have a legal team. If i want my money back I just have to recharge and complete the orders. It hit me that i might be a victim of a job scam given that the job responsibilities of a customer service officer was to serve at the customer best interests. I contacted alyssa to tell her about my problem. Alyssa told me that she could lend me $5,000 but for her own guaranteed, she instigated that i take a photo with my ic and a naked photo of myself. That's when i confirmed she was an accomplice. I immediately proceed to the nearest police station to lodge a police report and called the bank to notify about the transactions. At the police station i learnt that there was victims who reported on the same scam as well and was grateful that i did not borrow any money to put it in that account. I understand that the website had since been taken down by the Police but people in the group are still uploading photos of themselves completing the "job" and sharing articles on government efforts to help retailers in e-commerce. The group consist of 12 members and is operated by 3 admins. Below are the details of those still convincing everyone that this is a legitimate job: 1. Alyssa (admin) 2. Venus (admin) +65 8802 3474 3. Esher (admin) +65 9427 8328 4. Michelle +65 8433 8336 5. Cammy +65 8805 1473 6. Tushar +65 8917 2781 7. Peter +65 9427 7652
There’s a lot of MT5 (MetaTrader 5) scams lately, I’ve recently scammed 30k sgd out of me, therefore I like to share my experience as an awareness to the public hoping to save someone from being scam out there. Part 1 of the scam is to gather information from you and gaining your trust. How they do this is by adding an attractive face into their profile and start chatting with you, at the same time faking to build a long trusting relationship with you. Part 2 of the scam is they will let you know about their relative who works in the bank and obtain inside news, they will also hint you about the profit they are making to get you curious, they will be very patient in this until you got totally interested and wanted to start making some pocket money with them. Part 3 of the scam is to get you to download MT5 on your phone and open an account with their fake broker. Part 4 of the scam. They will give you their inside news when to buy or sell at a specific time of the day, their purpose is to show you how much money you can make within few mins so that you give in to your own greed. Part 5 of the scam. They will try to convince you that this news is hard to come by and so to treasure this news best is to deposit bigger so that one trade will be around 10% of your account value then that where you will fall into your own greed and deposit more hoping to earn more profit quickly. Part 6 of the scam. During this stage the broker will release a few dollars for your withdraw however when you wanted to withdraw a big amount that where they will put a stop and inform you that you need to pay a fee of 20% of your profit as part of the investment taxes. Part 7 of the scam. Most people during this stage have already know that they have fallen into the scam but if you really pay for their 20% fee their next scam would freeze your account due to illegal arbitrage because your account is constantly making profits and they demand a sum of money from you to unlock it or else your account will be deleted forever losing every money in it however if you pay for it they will just keep ignoring you from now on. Moral of the story here is the scammers are a team working together. The inside news that they send you is just simply mirrored and altering of MetaTrader platform data to show you fake results so that you trust what you are looking at and fallen into your own greed. Rule of thumb, if it’s too good to be true it’s probably going to be a scam.
Met a guy on bumble dating app. Said he didnt understand english and asked to text in other platforms. We texted over telegram and he asked for hobbies then shared about cryptocurrency trading. He asked me to sign up for an acct on a website called coincapssex and made me keep depositing money saying now is a good period for crypto investment. I only know i got scammed when i wasn't able to withdraw the money. Coincapsex is a scam. Lost 80k
Received a robocall with a female voice speaking bad English, claiming that i had some issue regarding my vaccination and to press a number.I know it’s a scammer so pressed the number to find out more. Person could not speak English and requested that i speak mandarin. Next, he asked me why I contact them so I played along and told him why. Following this, he asked me for my name and I gave a false name. I was then put on hold for a while. When he’s “back” from checking my information, he asked if my mobile number is my registered number. I told him it’s home registered number. After that he read off a script claiming that I had spread fake news about the covid situation and that my phone number will be terminated. I asked for his name and requested the phone number and office address of his “supervisor”. He asked me what’s the issue but i insisted I want to speak to his supervisor. He gave me MOH’s hotline number and office address, said I can look for a Mr Yang. Next, I asked him if my phone is terminated, then? Is he trying to scam money from me? He warned me to be careful of my words as the conversation is recorded (using another scare tactic). I scolded him for attempting to scam me and then he hung up on me 😆 Editor's Note: Please be wary of any incoming phone calls with the "+" prefix as this is an indication that the call originate from overseas. Do not interact with the robocall by pressing the key as instructed as this will prove that your number is a LIVE number and it will only encourage of such spam calls to be made to you.
This guy calling saying that he was a Singapore police officer. He is stating that my DBS card had been block for suspicious online purchase and he need to verify it in order for me to unblock the card. This happen on 18 oct 2021, at 1:40pm. Did not lost any money as i 200% sure it was a scam. No racist remarks here but the guy have an Indian accent. At the back, I can here another Indian guy shouting most probably at the midst of scamming other people too. Don't let down your guard! Editor's Note: Beware incoming phone calls with the "+" prefix as it's an indication that the call originates from overseas. If you are not expecting any overseas phone calls, don't pick up such phone calls.
Met the contact through FB dating platform - got introduced with cryptocurrency investments of different apps. Funds were transferred/ played between this platform and another. However, funds got stuck in the more dubious platform (with msgs prompting to invest more before being able to withdraw.) Only withdrew out half the amount of usd 2.5k while the rest got stuck. Beware of dubious investment platform
Job was promoted to be an e-commerce partner to boost sales. I got added into a group with 26 others. in the group, the others shared on how much they have earned to prove their success. the job: 1. take a screenshot of product being added into cart and send it to staff. 2. when staff says item is correct, transfer the price of product into a bank acc or via paynow provided 3. once successful, amount transfer will be refunded + 10% commission I carried out 2 jobs and was successful. in the third job, the following happened: note: i informed staff i can only use $500. 1. took a screenshot of having added 1 item (worth $500). and was approved so i trf $500. 2. staff said job 3 has 2 task and confirmed with me that i had to add 2 of the item, then trf the remaining $500. after which, the job is complete and i will receive my refund (aka 1 item = 1 task). 3. after transferring the 2nd $500, staff said the amounts transferred was considered as 1 task. the 2nd task is another $2000 worth of product. my money transferred will only be refunded after the 2nd task. (i didnt trf that amount) 4. another point to note is, instruction for job 2 and 3 is the same (said to contain 2 task). i only made a transfer for 1 item in job 2 but it was approved. 5. constant gaslighting from the staff. Despite informing I had $500 to spare and agreeing to give a job with low amount, they kept dragging it and it ended up having to be a total transfer of $3000. I realised that it was a mistake to respond to the ad in the first place, so don't be like me!
I received a Discord message a few weeks ago when someone sent me a free discord nitro link. I clicked on it and logged in to my discord account and nothing happened so i ignored it. A few days later on the 16 October 2021 at about 5:20 pm, I received several DMs from my discord friends that I sent a discord nitro link to them which i did not send it to them and realise my discord account was hacked. i also realised that i used my nric as my password which should not be used in the first place but i was too lazy to think of a stronger password which is hard to hack at that time when i first sign up for discord. Even though no money was lost at the moment, I'm worried that my nric will be revealed to unknown person but i am too afraid to left my parents know and decided to keep it to myself. i am too afraid to call the police because i do not want my parents to worry about me. therefore, I decided to share my story at scamalert.sg to prevent other victims who are using discord to click on unknown links as accounts can be hacked into easily.
I received a normal message about a loan offer. I pressed and it opened a Whatsapp chat. In order to apply for the loan, I submitted my nric photo, Cpf statement and bank account details . Shortly, they said it was approve. I chose the 3k loan, which monthly repayment was $268. He videocall-ed me to verify my identity with the ic that I submitted. But i didnt see his face it was all black. Then he called me to explain that he would transfer me $300 first to my account. I have to transfer him $500 to clear and will receive the loan afterwards. I told him i couldn't find $500 in such a short period of time. He asked me to transfer $200 to defer 1 week. So the next week, I had the $500 already to clear. I transferred him but he said cannot ibanking transfer have to cash deposit to the account. He told me to find another $500 to cash deposit. I said i couldn't as i have no more money left. I ask him to transfer me back the money so i could do cash deposit instead but he say could not. So he transfer me $300 back. And told me to find another $200 in 1week to make it $500 so i could clear and receive the loan. After 1 week i told him i have the $500 already and ready to cash deposit to his account. Suddenly he call me and say that today cannot do LOAN as something wrong with their bank account. He said transfer $200 to defer the loan and clear $500 nextweek. I said its ur faulty because your bank account got problem and not mine so why must i i transfer you back $200 to defer the loan when its ur account got problem. I said i do not want to continue and want to cancel the loan. He said could not as its been approved. To cancel, I must transfer him $500 and he will return me $300. From there i ignore his calls and text message. He said if i did not clear the payment it will become a issue and debt collector SERVICE will come to my address. I ignore and block his account. I regret the decision i make and my friends told me tht i was scam. Pls be careful.

Initially, I saw the part time job ads in FACEBOOK, click into the link and that was a lady using local number called Olivia, who instructed me to do a job task called boosting sales for Qoo10 merchant. The WhatsApp groups including about 17 members which I observed for about weeks to see their activities as those transactions are small amount. I was thought to try if really could be a commission based job and I did chat with one of the participants Who told me she worked as this job for few weeks and able to earn few thousands.the group got posted the campaign ads which including the lucky draw,I was doubt for it actually,but since the transaction amount small so took a try. For the first 4 transactions I was really tasted the "sweet" but the 5th Transaction started the trap already, the instructor claimed that I was not completed the task which have to screenshot ,the instructor told me I still have 2nd missions to be completed for getting the returned capital and commissions, but the 2nd missions I have to pay about 2k ++ which I confirmed this is scam tactics, looked from online scam alert that are lots of similar situations lots of victims faced before.so I would like to create the awareness the scam team can used lots of contact number with profile photo and they spent their time to act into group for getting your attention, better don’t click inside and join any group cha those scammers really put long bait for fishing one. I was glad I just lost hundreds of dollars before being trapped to the deeper amount.

1 I have known this person through dating app, and he asked for my telegram to talk more. 2. Since he added me he kept showing me his profit earned by trading btc on some website, I had listened but no interested to this kind of investment but he tried to insist me to try this 1 time only. First, he sent me some links and asked me to register by my phone number and top up $100 to try. After followed his instruction I have earned $10 and he taught withdraw all the amount. I did not suspect anything about this. Next time he asked me to top up $6000 and waited for him to help me plan how to trade with this amount. For a while turn out, with $6000 not enough to trade for this transaction, he told me it was risky to trade and asked me to top up until $18k. Which I did not have enough that amount, he lent me $3k and asked me to borrow some from my friend, I did not want to lose all the money i have put in, so i tried to asked around until have $17k to trade. He helped me to earn $3k after that and stopped because he said the market was not stable to continue. After that day, he told me i need to top up $17k more continue the trading for the safety, but i denied and he was so angry at me and i told him just trade with the amount I had because I did not want to continue just help me to finish and withdraw all the money inside there. 3. In the end, I lost $14k for follow his instructions.
Initially a lady named Gine messaged me on tele, mentioning about a job. I Thought it was weird because she just gotten my number out of nowhere. She gave me a number +6581069982, Corrina Lek and got me to WhatsApp her. The job entails grabbing things in ecommerce platform called overstock, just to boost order numbers and i need to complete 45 mission she told me to help her grab orders every day and always ask what time i can grab for Her. I have to top-up an amount and paynow to different people from so called their customer service officer. Every time bank account given was different. The orders were small at start. I started doing and topping money. But as time goes by, the top up amount grew, and I'm stuck when I am required to top up $500+ And somehow the customer service knew and messaged me saying that I need to continue so that I can get my commission. The website address keeps changing as It always fail load. Then one said this Corrina stop messaging me. I messaged her to ask for a new website link coz i need to quickly remove my bank details. But she kept blueticking me.. And when i want to look for their so called customer service to help, I realised that their registered business number was changed to become a normal standard number and messages sent is only 1 tick.
I was for licenced moneylenders online and found lending bee (the fake one obviously). the admin, olivia lim, contacted me on whatsapp and ask information such as ic, payslips, CPF history and bank statement. thereafter, the loan was 'approved' and she sent me a contract and needed me to pay $3000 for admin fee and $3000 for stamp duty fee, both to different bank accounts. she even mentioned that the money is refundable after the loan is released. After the transfer, I was routed to the finance person, who said will activate my bank account for future repayment. that account activation would cost me $4000 and she told me it's refundable. amount paid up till this point: ADMIN FEE ($3000) - UOB 42239673?? STAMP DUTY FEE ($3000) - STANDARD CHARTERED 40297847?? ACCOUNT ACTIVATION ($3000) - STANDARD CHARTERED 40297847?? I was routed to the manager, mike. he called me (in ah beng fashion) and asked if I have paid for government tax. I was in shock, because to get a loan, i need to fork out that much of money. and this point of time, other than being really tired of having to fork out money before i get the money, my scam radar finally kicked in. looking at their whatsapp bio, the email stated was LENDINGBEE.ORG.SG@GMAIL.COM, which obviously suspicious. not only that, there were many typo errors on the contract. Instead of calling mike to tell him that he is a scam (or potentially a loan shark), i told him i want to exit this thing. he told me, in order to exit, i would need to fork out 20K, as per the contract. however they would return 10K to me. out of my mind, losing 20k is better than they coming to my house or office to harrass me, i called up the legitimate licenced moneylender for loan to pay for the 20K and to exit the scam. Not only did the LEGITIMATE LICENCED MONEYLENDER stopped my application upon hearing that I was borrowing money to pay for scam, they helped me to call the scam hotline and told me to make police report. they even told me not to be scared of them and reassured me that things would be okay. I made police report and have blocked them. it's an expensive lesson (10K T^T) but it's a lesson which i will remember for life. even if I'm unable to recover the 10k, I just hope my story can help others.
There was a person text me at Telegram asking whether am I looking for a part time job then ask me to WhatsApp the lady name Jennifer (84643784). So basically is a local number so I think should be ok. Then ask me to register an account in a link provided and help the agent. The job is register an new account on the "EY" group platform to increase sales for merchants on a task-by-task end, tasks may range from 40 to 120 per day, and you get sgd20 for registering an new account in "EY" group platform now. The job is recharge by myself to help merchants do robotic task, completing 40 single jobs in 20-30 minutes and your commission will go directly to your own account. Once you have registered your account, send me your invitation code and i will register my name under your account and so that you can get my 20% commission. This is the link to register for job on the "EY" group platformhttp://www.dddas.live (Note: DO NOT CLICK) invitation code:qtl8k3"You start with 65 without the + symbol after you done register, send me your invitation code." That’s what the agent send me. After I done the first round and was just a small amount and I manage to get my money back so I think was legit. But after that money start to increase until at least need to top up another $2k that is when I think is not right so i report it to police. It still texting people in telegram or Facebook to ask people to join. Hope it helps to spread the awareness of this scam.
Lady called Cherry Loh reached out to me on tele, asking if I'm looking for part time job and join their project. She gave me a number +6581069982, Corrina Lek and got me to contact her for more info. By grabbing things in ecommerce platform called overstock, just to boost order numbers which need to complete 45 mission than they allow to withdraw back the funds with commission given to you. All you need to do is to top-up the goods amount and paynow to different people. Every time bank account given was different. The orders were small initially. I managed to withdraw the first round and I thought thinking it was safe, But at the 2nd attempt, the top up amount grew, I could only withdraw upon completion of 45 missions; the product price is boosting up to $8000 and that time I had already transfer $11k. Asking me to ask for a loan to pump in the account, but I claimed that i had run out of fund and almost all the people said can lend me the balance of $500 unless i top up the remanding $7500. I whatsapp-ed the company asking for a refund but they said "u must complete the 45 tasks then only can withdraw all." The system has strict rules that everyone must complete 40 orders before withdrawal. If the merchant complained 3 times, then you are deemed to have not completed the order. It will then be frozen. To unfreeze, the only way is to reduce the number of agents who do not complete the order you need to find a way to finish as soon as possible and hopefully you can withdraw your funds and get your commission back as soon as possible .Then, I quickly went to NPC to lodge a report. Must take note and be vigilant to prevent scammer.
Buyer contacted me via Carousell on 6 Oct expressing interest in 2 small items priced at S$10. He provided me with an email address to contact him to arrange meetup or post, but his account was suspended within the next few minutes. This screams red flag but I still emailed him as I thought there could be valid reasons why his account was suspended, besides the items were not expensive. I even wrote to Carousell enquiring about user's account but they were unable to disclose any info due to their privacy policy and even cautioned me not to proceed with any ongoing transactions with him. Anyway buyer goes by the name of Anthony who was very polite and prompt in all his replies, even though he is based in USA and wants to send the items to someone in Malaysia (another red flag). He sent me recipient's mailing address and contact number and wanted to know cost of items and shipping fees, agreeing to pay either through PayPal or bank transfer. All this while, I was thinking as long as I don't receive payment, I will not ship items out so there's nothing to lose. After informing him that he has to pay me S$17 for the items plus overseas shipping, he decided to purchase more items amounting to over S$100 without a single enquiry (yet another red flag). Total cost of additional items incl registered international mail amounted to S$130.60 and he proceeded to pay via bank transfer without hesitation. I received a transfer confirmation email almost immediately (see attached screenshots) from "Citibank". Upon looking at the email content, I knew straightaway it was a scam. There are just too many stories and cases that highlight buyers as victims but sellers are at risk too, esp now that the scams are getting to be more sophisticated. Rule #1: Keep your transactions within the official platform, ignore any requests to divert conversations off platform. Rule #2: Do not ship out your items until you are properly paid, no such thing as the bank holding your money.
These scammers are running some MLM company. They seemed keen to help you make money, and they usually used women to lure you into a WhatsApp group chat where other 'people' are friendly and keen to make money together as well. The job seemed too good to be true - just by clicking links. I ignored my gut instincts and went ahead with taking out my money to do 'jobs'. it all happened too fast. please do not be like me. be vigilant. Do not let them get away with it.
Received a robocall today that claimed to be from MOH and that i have been traced being in close contact with a covid-19 case and that MOH has contacted me twice (i have never received) which I failed to respond. I hung up the call.
Someone DM me on Indeed.com for a position as business analysis manager on 17 june 2021. Her name goes by 'lisa' but her display name looks like a pseudonymous 'easdrutykaer naedsrjkadesu', probably a tactic so that we can't recall their name easily. I accepted the invite to connect, and lisa told me a personnel from the company will contact me. But it was a non-sg number who contacted me in whatsapp and the person name is 'Monica' saying that she wanted to interview me at 2pm on 18 June. i was surprised it was not a zoom interview, the person went on to ask interview question in whatsapp messenger in writing. I followed and first hour we were talking about the job. The interview went on for almost 2 hours, and told me she will contact me again for 'second round' interview at 7pm. I just followed as I needed job. But the correspondence turned out to be something else, she asked politely out of context questions. and shared that the boss I would be working with is a nice person who likes to share 'profits' from trading. I felt something amiss. the correspondence went on through the weekend and i half-heartedly participated in the conversation which is no longer related to work: how many kids I have. what my wife is working. what are you doing tonight etc etc. I got very annoyed at last, when i sounded to her. please email me, this is not the kind of interview i am expecting. Monica got annoyed asking about my attitude to her and told me she got scolded by her boss. This is scam tactic, beware!
Met this girl on Facebook dating, and she seemed really genuine. It was also my first time using Facebook data or any dating platforms. she suggested that we move to line and continued chatting there. it started getting flirty and she asked if I wanted to do a video call which I agreed to. She did something compromising on video and asked me to do likewise. She also asked me to download an app called private space whereby i had to key in my phone number and a referral code provided by her. i think this was how she managed to obtain my contact list. the next day the scammer threatened to send the video to everyone in my contact list if I did not pay $2000. made a police report and blocked all of the scammer's number. Guys if you all happen to experience the same thing as I did, please do not pay any money to them. I highly doubt that they will delete the video and stop asking for payment. i know that some of you may feel scared but it's ok, these things happened. find someone trustable like your family members to talk to and it helps a lot.
I was offered a job to work for overstock to do orders processing and earn commission. It happened over a spend of 3 days and i lost a total of 35k to them. They kept asking for more and I said no. they have since blocked me on WhatsApp.

Received this automated call in English from +6581029370 saying it's from MOH, was redirected to someone who also spoke in Chinese asking me what sort of clarification I needed. I felt it was off. Why would MOH contact me with a Chinese speaking co and why wouldn't they text me. I hung up immediately.
Telegram message received from Cherry loh: Hi, we are hiring part timer for our project. Get back to me if you interested.As I was having some financial difficulties, I was curious and replied.

The website looks really fake and is asking for particulars.I did not continue, however some pple may be cheated and may just continue to submit particulars and etc.Hope no one gets cheated.

An Indian man, claiming to be from Lazada, called to inform that there was an attempt been made to make a purchase from my account. In order to cancel the purchase he wanted me to read out a code that he claimed was sent from Lazada. I assume it was an OTP he was trying to get. He became quite aggressive when I WOULDN'T comply. I hung up.
Received a call stating they are from Lazada and that i had some unauthorized purchases that they blocked because they suspect a scam. they said that to cancel those transactions they will send me a cancellation code that i have to verify by reading the code out to them. The SMS received from Lazada was actually an otp code to reset password. luckily on the message it says "Do not share this with anyone, not even Lazada" and hence i suspect a scam. The person on the phone insisted it was a cancellation code, not an otp. I hung up the call. maybe can share the story or phone number with others so they know of such scams.
Kept insisting no self collect, only delivery within 3 hours can reach. 1) price was too cheap ($750) for a brand new graphics card valued at $1350 onwards 2) even with cheap price, delivery was free 3) insisted on no meet ups and only delivery 4) Carousell account seemed to be a personal account that was hacked, with no prior sales of similar item. When I told him I reported to police, he immediately replied "your father" and phone number was no long contactable. The advertisement on carousell also switched from user "Kovi" to current user "tacticalindustries" with same product and details but with a different Whatsapp number.

The commission was 5% of the amount transferred and she promised the commission and principal amount will be transferred be to me immediately after my transfer. Finally, I agreed to help her out and was given another number by Judy she claimed was the q0010 customer service. The first 3 jobs were small amount and I was given the refund and commission immediately. Then the issue comes when i was asked to transfer an amount for the item worth about 2.5k. I made the transfer and this time the money was not returned to me. This time the customer service told me that I was supposed to transfer not for just 1 of that item but 3 items (total 7.5k) before I could get the money back. I believed the customer service and transfer the amount and afterwards I was told to transfer even more money before I could get all of them back including the commission on the whole amount. I made the transfer and now the customer service told me that because I have exceeded the time given for me I have to do another job before I could unfreeze my account and get my money back. It was now that I realised that I have been scammed and I made a trip down personally to the police station to report the case

I received a call on 5 Oct 2021 morning from a Indian accent lady claiming to be calling from SingTel technical department. She told me that SingTel has detected that there is some issue with my internet connection and that my router security might have been compromised. She even went on to provide me a long "customer license number" upon my request for verification but the number seems alien to me. Then she kept asking if I have computer in front of me as she can guide me online to do the verification. When I told her I do not have a computer in front of me and asked her to call back later, she abruptly hung up the call. I have verified with SingTel and confirmed that there is no such call from their technical department and the call is a scam. Fortunately for me, I did not reveal any information to the scammer.
Hi there, I'd like to report a number that's being used for scams - +65 8805 7451. I met this individual through a dating app, and he/she tried to get me to sign up on a crypto trading site WorldCoin (which seems dubious at best). Please kindly add the number to the list of scammed numbers and inform TPG to terminate the line if possible! I've raised a request with the police as well!
Received a call from this number (+65 8528 7011), which played an automated voice message claiming to be from MOH and that I have been a close contact of a person infected with covid-19. it asked me to press the number '3', after which someone picked up the call and started speaking in Mandarin which (fortunately) I didn't understand). I felt it was suspicious firstly because of the +65 in the number, and also because of how the person sounded unprofessional.

A lady reached out to me on tele, asking if I’m looking for part time job which I was. She gave me a number 91028350 and got me to contact her for more info. At first, I assumed I was being asked to do admin work for this lady and proceeded to do it for the commission, however, after completing, I had to put in my own money and complete my own task orders before I can withdraw my money. I managed to withdraw the first round, thinking it was legitimate, i added a lot of money to earn more commission but i never got my money back. Please be aware of scammers, and don’t commit the same mistakes as me. I lost my life savings, 22k, meant for school fees and insurance and now I have to work 3 jobs to cover my school fees, and insurance.
I needed to buy a laptop for my son as his uni course has commenced. I came across an ad on Facebook about gaming laptop. When I tapped on the ad, it opened up a WhatsApp chat. The person directed me to his company's webpage at http://gaminglaptopsg.com to view the catalogue. The company is supposedly located in sim lim square and has an active ACRA profile. Everything looked legitimate to me and I decided to place an order on 10/9/21. I was sent an invoice through email with payment details for internet banking transfer of $1,500 to a DBS account. The following day, I enquired about the delivery date and somebody from their "logistic dept" called me from a sg number and told me that I was required to pay a $300 refundable fee to get a permit to release the goods from Changi cargo zone, or cancel the order and get a full refund. I immediately opted for a refund and asked for a proof of fund transfer back to me. They actually sent me a screenshot of a fund reversal transaction from POSB internet banking. 3 weeks on, I never receive the refund and my bank confirmed that there wasn't any such transaction. Throughout the past 3 weeks, they still responded to my WhatsApp and email like they are a real company with real customer service. Their WhatsApp and webpage are still online. Meanwhile, I have lodged a police report and alerted DBS.Editor's note: Please purchase from reputable online retailers that offer a comprehensive buyers' protection schemes or provide escrow payment services where payments are released after users acknowledged receipt of the items.

1/10/2021 At 4.59pm a Call from +65 8874380?. inform me that I might be exposed to covid but the authority tried to contact me twice but failed. Ask me press 3 so someone can explain to me. It was ROBOTIC Voice in English follow by Chinese. As its +65 And robotic voice I knew its a scam thus I hang up. I just went SGH on 20/9, 27/9, 29/9 Thus if I am not familiar with how scammer works I can easily fall for it. Our authority is MOH and with 2268 new covid a day, moh hotline is completely unreachable unless you are willing to wait for hours to get thru a hotline staff. So I think it is best to share here so if someone encountered similar scam they don't have to waste their time.
Had received spoofing calls on my workplace phone. Below are the 3 calls received claiming from Singtel: 1. 21 Sep 12.50pm caller address as Peter from Singtel requesting for IP address and to check on the security.

Caller called from Tel No 6602448? 3. 23 Sep at 10.56am caller mentioned from Singtel from Security department requesting IP address as someone is trying to have access to your internet. I questioned on why is he calling from a mobile number and asked if he is a third party. He replied in a defensive manner that he was1st party from Singtel and he is calling from Jurong. I mentioned I will call Singtel to check. He put down the call when I get my colleague to talk to the caller. Caller called from HP 9733024?. BELOW ARE THE 8 CALLS RECEIVED CLAIMING FROM MOH and other calls were not picked Up today on 1 oct 2021: 1. 0025275621824 2. 00234520345352 3. 0030516021591 4. 006091589963 5. 0060390605299 6. 0060161041085 7. 00359481717774 8. 0025275621824 Editor's Note: Please beware of incoming phone calls with a "+" prefix.

I am serving home recovery now because I was tested positive from covid. so I have been accepting calls from almost anyone, because it might be from MOH of my teledoctors. I didn't noticed that there was a "+65" in front of number, from the scammer. but I picked it up. then I heard a voice recording in Chinese, telling me that I might have covid and need to serve isolation. if i want to speak with an officer, press 5. so I press 5, and then a lady spoke to me asking how she might helped me. I told her she call me one and ask her what is this about. she said I need to serve isolation and i might have some documents that need to be delivered. my suspicion raised because this sounded like she want to scam be for some freight charges. so I ended the call immediately when she asked me for me name to verify.
I met this person from tantan, a dating app. We started dating after his confession. He knew i have some forex trading experiences. So, he insisted me to switch my broker to the one he was using. The company is named “richness empire”. It is infamous for its scam tactics. I knew when I researched on it. However, blinded by love and his words of assurance, I still opened an account. Yes, I was out of my mind. Richnes? Empir? has a simple interface website for you to check your account, but top-up is done via whatsapp, a so-called customer service number was given to me by that person. For withdrawal, you have to submit a request on the website, then inform the customer service. You will be given personal bank accounts to transfer, which i later found out these are the individuals who are either assisting, or being scammed by probably the same criminal syndicate. Profits were raking in. I was blinded by greed and was slowly encouraged to top-up until the deposit hit usd50k. In between, the person transferred usd5k, and i managed to withdraw usd3k. Due to multiple top-ups and one transfer, richness empire accused me of money laundering and froze my account. They demanded usd20k to unfreeze, and i paid. When my account unfroze, i submitted a withdrawal request. It wasn’t processed, and the excuse given was “due to high volume of transactions”. Two days later, Richness? Empir? accused me of illegal arbitrage because the account is constantly profiting. They suspended my withdrawal and froze my account again, demanding another usd30k. I told them I will make a police report. They told me to do so, but I will still have to pay them to unfreeze my account. I accepted the fact I was scammed and went to make a police report. Oh ya, about the usd3k withdrawal, it was transferred to my bank account by 2 individuals. I initially thought they were part of the company. However, one of them is a victim of a love scam. As a result, i was accused of money laundering. Luckily, I lodged a report much earlier than him. Please don’t be like me, foolishly believed and followed in everything. No broker will ever ask you to transfer money to personal bank accounts.
Call came in and Informing of important message and to press a number to be transferred. I was then informed that my identity has been used to purchase a phoneline and the number was also used to scam money from people. I should have noticed the red flags when they asked for my name and phone number. Anyway, my my call was suddenly passed to the person's manager. The manager repeated the problem and that it is paramount I contact china shanghai police department within 2 hours as it was a serious offence. After I asked for more details and how to reach the China Police Station. He offered to transfer the call. That was when I know I am in a middle of a scam. I hung up but they kept calling back for more than 10 times.Editor's Note: If an incoming call has a "+" prefix, pls do not pick up if you are not expecting overseas phone calls as this is mostly likely be a scam call. Do not hand over your personal details over the phone without verification.
I was called by Singtel officer asking details about how internet service is slow and then blame it on network sharing. Then he was joined by another officer from CSA ( cyber security agency), they both intimated me to reveal all the details about my banks and then they tricked me to transfer SGD 45000 ( USD 33000) to some person in HK. I have reported the case with police and investigation is underway also i have asked the bank to stop transaction. For this purpose i am not sharing any further details. I am reporting this to alert the community.
I received 2 scam calls from someone claimed that they are from amazon. Right from the beginning I knew those were scam calls but i played along as i wanted to know what kind of tricks they are using. 1) first call was an Indian accent guy who said i have made a purchase for a laptop that costs $3000. I asked him name of person who made the order. he told me michael William. i asked him do I sound like Michael (I am female). he said yes. i repeated do i sound like a guy. he hung off. my caller id showed he called from a mobile number. i called back that number. it was a valid number but nobody answered the call. the next day i received a missed call. when I returned the call, a lady answered. I told her i got a missed call from her number, she said she also received a missed call from my number. 2) second call was also from an Indian accent guy. this time the caller said someone from Germany had just made a purchase for a $5000 MacBook using my amazon account. he asked me do i want to approve or decline the purchase. i asked him what do i need to do to approve or decline. he said if approve, then i have to make payment from my bank account. I told him i prefer to pay by credit card. he said there is already a pending credit card payment. i then asked for the last 4 digits of the credit card number. he said he will email me the details and i have to enter 6 pin number to open it. i refused and insisted he tells me over the phone. he lost his patience and said to me "you just come down to amazon office to give me a bxxx job and I will tell you the number". he wasn't even able to tell me amazon office address nor phone number but instead asking me to google for it. This scammer also spoofed a mobile number, so i called back that number, it turned out to be an invalid number
I met this woman on paktor dating app.at first, we chatted well and started to know each other. Over the next few days, she wanted me to invest with her on worldcoin. This website operates with a customer service inside, otc transfer service via DBS and world coin customer service using 81 90-4563-3072.otc transfer service lets you to trade on the world coin website using usd. However, you cannot withdraw as you wish. Once you put it in for whatever reasons, you are to trade and make money first before withdrawing so this is a huge downside. To all the traders, please think twice before doing OTC transfer and trade on worldcoin.
I fell prey to the online purchase scam recently (about 2 days ago) as my wife shared a link on a super cheap robot vacuum cleaner that only cost $39. At first, I thought for sure it is a scam until she convinced me to order it as the payment will only be done after receiving the package. long story short, little did i know that when I'm out for work, my wife received the package and paid to the courier without checking what's the item she received. turns out it's a fake golden dragon chain and bracelet. I hope people are aware that when the price purchase is too good to be true, you just have to double and triple check and alert yourself that it is a scam. The total lost was $39. to me it's a big lesson learnt to not fall into such prey again and warn my families and friends.

I hope u guys can assist to block it soonest so that others out there will not be scammed. Below are the fake sites:- https://creditlinkbank.com/home/ https://zionconstruction.co/

My wife is pregnant with another baby, and with the debts that the family have, she wanted to help lighten financial load of family. She resorted online for part time jobs but was subsequently scammed online up to $120,000 after being asked to get more loans to put in more money in order to get her money back. She never got back her money. After this incident, she feels shameful, anxiety attacks and having suicidal thoughts for what she did. She blames herself for being naïve and stupid and no longer trust her ability to discern right from wrong.What happened Pregnant with a baby and family debts, my wife decided to google part time jobs online. A man named James offered her a part time job online to earn some money by buying things in his ecommerce platform just to boost his order numbers. And subsequently he promised to return her money with 10% commission. The orders were small initially at $3. She bank transfer $3 and she did receive a return $3.10 commission. Throughout the day, she trusted the business (Volusion.live) and slowly transferred up to $4000 to James and received commission from it around $200 at the payout timing 9pm. Next day, the company (Volusion.Live) approached her again. After gaining trust from my wife, she was asked to make a purchase of $5000 of item. After making the bank transfer, the company assured my wife that the payout will only be made at 9pm. She was also placed into a group chat where there many other part timers (fake accounts) doing this and they also assured her that it is not a scam and it is legit. They subsequently used time running out tricks and scares to make my wife send more money in if not she will not receive her money back. The order amounts subsequently escalated to 20k+ where she realised, she does not have enough cash to fund the orders. The scammers and the part timers then suggested to loan from banks, families and friends and mentioned that it is normal to do that and that everyone doing this is loaning money. They promised to return her money once she made the orders. She borrowed like around $100k from banks, friends and family to fund her account and it was only after that she realised that these scammers will never give back her money that she decided to inform her husband and called the police.
I met Harry Ronnie on a dating app and we continue on whatsapp, planned to meet up but before we meet up he said that his company is sending him to Malaysia but once he’s back we’ll meet and spend time together. He said his Scotland bank account got locked and he needs to access it to get funds for the job he’s doing in Malaysia for Petronas. He said he needed a SG simcard for it but since he’s in Malaysia he’s asks me a favour to buy a sim card and send it to him. I was blinded by his sweet words and want to help I bought and sent it via FedEx. He said he needs to do top up. After doing the top up he said that its not working and asked me if it’s okay for me to lend some money which I said no. He called and got mad then said he’s just going to borrow money from his colleague Kim Wang and if it can be deposit to my bank account so I can send it to him because he really wants to finish his work asap as the covid there is high. He said the money is for him to buy materials for work and expenses in Malaysia. After transferring the money deposited to my account I received a call from the bank telling me that my online banking has been disabled and that a deposited cash to my account has been reported as a fraud. I was confused on what’s happening so I told the bank I will first check what’s happening. Harry Ronnie said that his colleague Wang didn’t reported anything and that he will ask Wang to go to the bank. He suddenly said his colleague transferred another money to my account and that I should send it to him via WU because he needed it to settle his workers payment. There’s an issue with the WU that I was not able to send him the money. He called, shouted and accused me of lying to him and taking interest on his money. This is also when I feel pressured and broke down crying because he’s accusing me. To prove to him that I’m not lying I borrow money from a colleague so the money can be sent to him. We got okay after the money has been transferred to him and he said that he’ll come back to Singapore by Sunday and asked if I can send him cash because he still needs to settle his workers payment and I told him that I can’t send him any cash. He showed me a CIMB cheque and a letter that he needs to pay the worker’s first before he can travel back to Singapore. I know it’s too late but this is when I realized that I’m being scammed so I called the police and ask what to do next as I’m really confused.
84616853 called my mobile number at 8:59am 21/9/2021. Said he is calling from Starhub, regarding on recent internet errors. But I am not using Starhub, I pretended I had multi starhub account and asked which address he is talking about, he couldn't answer. Then I asked him for my name, he also couldn't answer, so I hung up and typed this report
The lady contacted me via Whatsapp. Got more comfortable with me and claimed to love me and wanted to have a future with me. Eventually, she proposed doing a co-investment. Both parties will contribute a certain amount to this investment platform in order to earn lucrative profits. She would emotionally blackmail me to invest more. I lost over $25,000
Got to know this girl on FB. It started out normal but eventually went over to WhatsApp. It was well over the first 3 weeks that she started asking about financial and savings. She asked me to do crypto trading and asked me to download an app, I was asked to put in close to 6000 worth of SGD in order to win. I did had my reservations so I lied about only having about 2000SGD due to the pandemic eating up into my savings. she also mentioned that she would guide me through and make sure i do earn every time. the initial transaction on it was sketchy, it requires one to send ibanking transfer to a OCBC/UOB Bank account. after a week of fiddling with her I realize that the earnings looked sort of premeditated. it's always around the same benchmark. managed to retrieve once when i asked her to show me how money is retrieved to reduce my loss. however, it's still a total loss of about 1800SGD. when I gave her the final straw and mention that I really wasn't able to get extra funds, she turned cold and made almost every topic related to such investments.
Got to know the person through Facebook. She will try to tell you about her life, then slowly bring in this part-time qoo10 job that she's been doing for several months. She also uses more than one contact number. But basically will ask you to visit this qoo10 page, screenshot the item to confirm the item (which is strange), supposedly to increase page view. You are then asked to transfer $100 to pay the merchant. And you will receive a 5-10% commission.The scammer also try to help you pay for the item first, through bank transfer, then ask you to give your bank account, to receive money from the merchant, in order to gain your trust. Other tactics include guilt-tripping.Remember to never reveal your bank info or card number and never to bank transfers without verification!
Basically this person messaged me regarding job opportunity on indeed impersonating as Google Asia Pacific HR Director. I went through linked in to search her name but was not found. Initially were asking interview related questions and later on start to side track saying that she did investment in crypto. She will even ask whether I had my dinner which I found it weird and suspicious late at night. I doubt a HR rep would be that free to ask whether we had our dinner; moreover she’s a HR director. Anyway, I didn’t lose anything; just my precious time.
She identified her as the HR Director of OTIS, Singapore. Looked into my profile and found that I'm a match for her company. After going through the interview, she started to be friendly. Then she slowly started to intro CRYPTOCURRENCY investments to me. This is obviously a scam attempt!
I was called on my landline (first with an automatic voice, later a woman and then a man) with the story that my Amazon account is hacked and that someone ordered an i-Phone and I have to pay for it if I don't go to my account together with them and make sure to cancel the transaction. They asked for my name but did not know the right name of the account. they were interested in the device I use and it was not possible to do this on my chrome book, I needed to start the computer. Luckily the pc didn't work and I called my husband, also to ask if this could be true or not. when I told the caller that I could not open the pc he just hang up! I lost nothing.
Got to know this guy from Facebook dating app. Only after chatting for a day or a day or two, they will advance super quickly to ask you to chat on another platform, like WhatsApp or telegram. told me that he is a Singaporean, but was raised in the us. Father is like a nomad, always moving around countries to countries. First to the UK, then to the us and settled down there. He will share with you sob stories of how his parents died in a car accident few years back, his fiancee broke up with him just before their wedding because she found out she is at the final stage of some cancer, does not have any family members around because their relationship was not good. Only have 1 best friend who is currently serving the army in Afghan. He is an oil rig consultant. Works offshore, and operates independently. Got himself a place here in Singapore. Told me that he has to travel to Houston for a submit conference, even screenshot to show you the content of his last minute invitation. Told me he has an oil rig contract to fulfil in Ukraine in 2 weeks’ time. Things started escalating quickly, he will just suddenly and randomly drop you a random WhatsApp call, and try to guilt trip you that you are avoiding him. And shortly after chatting, they will say they love you and ask you to be his partner. Even if they haven't seen you. Their reasoning is, they know that you are the one for them. i requested for a video call. But he gave quite a number of ridiculous reasoning like he can't do video calls because of where he is. But promise to call me on a certain day when he goes back to Baltimore. Scammer will try to sweet talk you and make you believe in him. Once he got to Ukraine for his contract, 2 weeks later, he will call or send you a text that his mud pump is faulty and he needed financial help. I was sceptical at first, but the way they speak to you, is so believable that you will think is true. And he sounded really desperate that all i wanted was to help, which I eventually did. And reasons for him asking for more money became more ridiculous, like paying his supplier and his workers, or having no money to eat, and needing to take a private jet back to the USA, so he can pay everyone that he has asked to borrow money from. When i suggested to him to take a commercial flight, another stupid reason came out again, and he will guilt trip you by saying you don't understand what he is going through. This was the time when i started to suspect that i got scammed, and made a police report.
Please be careful when meeting people on dating apps such as tinder, cimb etc.The scammers will always sweet talk you and say how in love they are with you when you have never met them in person. They will always give excuses when you say you want to meet. They will start introducing you to investment schemes such as lottery apps which they found loopholes and have been earning money from the app which no one is aware.The usual tactic they use is to entice you with small wins first and let you enjoy the gains for a period.Then they will start to brainwash you to put more money in so that the returns you get will be higher. Next is tell you there is a once in a lifetime promotion. The more money you put in, the more bonus money you will get in return. He will take the lead first and show you that he has put in all his money in and left you to pump in the money to enjoy the promotion. He will pressurize you with deadline, if the money is not pumped in within certain time, all your existing money in the account will be lost.Please be more alert when someone start talking to you about investment or money when you have never met the person. These scammers have well thought out plan in mind to use on their victims. Editor's Note: Investors are reminded to do their own due diligence before investing. Always do a "Ask. Check.

I received a call from the mobile number 9320019? on 15 Sep 2021 (Weds) at around 3:50pm. When I answered the call, I heard a voice message purporting to be from the "Singapore high court" informing me that i had a "summons" that "had not been processed" and inviting me to press "9" for more information. Upon pressing "9", I was attended to by a man who sounded like someone of Chinese ethnicity. I explained to the man that I had been redirected to him after hearing a voice message (the contents of which I relayed to him). The man asked for my summons number; I replied that I did not know. The man then asked for my identification number; after supplying him with fake information, I revealed to him that I was going to report his number to the authorities as the call was obviously a scam call. His response was simply to tell me to "please go ahead and report me" before hanging up. At all times during the call described above, I put on a fake accent and was fully aware that the call was not legitimate. I am just sharing this experience to raise awareness.
My temple teacher also one of my Facebook friend, suddenly used messenger to message me and asked for my phone number, Which we didn’t exchange at all and we don’t message each other as we will meet every Sunday in the temple. He told me that if he gets 5 votes he will Grab cash voucher with me. I thought of helping him to win the votes and he also can win Prizes, why not. Just help him only. So I send him my phone number. He told me I have to copy and send the code back to him as he need the code to win the votes. So I just follow. Then he say I won $1150 and asked to transfer the money to my account. But I need to copy and send code back to him again. I started to be suspicious as he is a high class person, and he doesn’t need all this. Plus I remember what I watched on Crime Watch. I stop replying.
Scammer called claiming he’s from Amazon. Ask if I have authorized a transaction for SGD2412. I said no and he said he will stop the transaction. He then mentioned and “checked” that it’s my phone number that ends with xxx last 3 numbers. I started to feel suspicious as the background noise from his phone was very noisy and can hear other people talking. He sounds too aggressive to be a staff from Amazon. Straight after, he asked for my email address. I ask how I can verify he is calling from Amazon and ask why he need it when Amazon already has my email address. Scammer said he need me to verify my identity using my email address so that he can stop the transaction. I refused and my husband took over and told him we will call the credit company to cancel the transaction. He said that it is no use and the transaction will go through unless he verifies my email address. My husband asked him to send 2FA to my email address and told him off before he hung up on him. This guy has a heavy Indian accent and the number shows local line number with a prefix of +65.
I got a call from someone claiming to be from amazon.com. Said that there is a suspicious transaction on my account and asked me for my email to verify I'm the amazon user. I was skeptical but he did send email with @amazon.com email account. Gave him the verification no that came to my email. Then he shared the suspicious transaction via email. Then he asked for debit card details so say he cancel transaction on his end. And he said some transactions on credit card also which I said I never store that on amazon. He said my IP sever compromised. Gave him details as well. All card details given including the pin behind card. Didn't feel comfortable so after call ended i called bank to lock both cards. There were 11 otp passwords I received when on call with u- 5 for debit card, 6 for credit card but I don't think will transactions went through. This happened 13th sept 2.18-3.28pm. At point of card blocking debit card lost $1600.70 and credit card lost $1760.93. Working with bank on fund recovery.
At first, this guy mentioned that he is legit. So I gave in and share my personal details such as (ic front and back), CPF contributions and several contact numbers. It was suspicious already that I have to do all of that on WhatsApp and not in real life but I ignored my gut feelings (which I totally regretted). He mentioned to me that I’ll have to deposit 200 to ''secure my loan credit". It is already fishy, I wanted to back out and I mentioned o him I don’t want this loan anymore and he said, he already transferred me 200 (I assumed that the person whom transferred it to me is one of the scam victims too) , so the next day I have to transfer back 400 to them. So, the next day, I transferred $400 but the person scolded me cause I did not add remarks for the transfer. So I was told to transfer again. At this point, it's getting ridiculous. I wanted to stop but I remembered they have my ic, like address etc and phone numbers of the people around me. So i give in. I transferred again. Told him I’m not interested anymore in the call, but he send me the agreement letter and pressured me into signing it. I told him I want to cancel even before the agreement letter, I signed to shut him up but he told me about the cancellation fee is 30%. So I had to transfer $900. Which I did to stop all of these, but he acted confused, asking where's the other $900 transaction screenshot. I’m like huh why? He said to delete particulars. The agreement stated "cancellation/delete particulars" which means the total is $900. So I scolded him with their own agreement they made up, and he argued that he will return the $900 after deleting my particulars + $400 + $200 that I transferred earlier. If you are returning anyway why do I still have to transfer? But I don't want to take the risk and give him another $900 so I photoshopped a fake transaction screenshot to stall some time while going to the police cos he kept messaging and calling me. It’s annoying. So far, I haven't gotten any calls from these scammers with their other numbers, I have warned people around me about these to block immediately. I will gather the evidence and compile for the report I have lodged. Editor's note: Loan scammers or unlicensed moneylenders will attempt to impersonate licensed moneylenders to cheat.

Get to know her thru those social app, claimed that she is PR and her mum is sgrean. i didn't suspect anything wrong at all. then she will ask you to help her thru her investment portal, she will pass u her account and password to gain your trust. so i followed her instructions accordingly, and get to see how she earned from that so-called loophole. in between, she'll contact you a lot to show care and concern to you. at the same time, try to get you to open an account and earn money together with her. initially small amount, then she'll try to smoke you, putting higher amount. finally you will receive a msg from the cust service telling you, you're selected for an lucky event. as she mentioned she had been thru this event, and its her third time, etc, telling to register for the event too. neither did she say a lot about the "event" nor did I ask a lot of questions, i just did it as per told, without questioning, asking, nor did I read properly. after you reg for the event, it does state that you are enrolled, u have to hit a certain amount, and during that 2days, you cant withdraw your money out. in between that 2 days, she will find ways to help you top-up by borrowing from her 'friends', and then she'll start telling u, her friends is chasing the $ back from her, when can I settle that target. finally, she said she tried her best, she managed to get $x, still shortage 5k, she had no solutions already, if i can get the balance 5k, she will top-up that $x amount to my 'account' again. as I thought even if i didn't hit that target, I can still get back my amount. after speaking to that cust service, they reply me saying that if i didn't HIT THAT AMOUNT, my account will be suspended and block. YEAH, CONCLUSION, I REALISED ITS TOO LATE FOR ME. so the next day, I made a police report. The moral of the story is don't fall for fake compassion; it's all fake! Don't be greedy, Don't trust anyone that you just know blindly, especially one whom you got to know online!
Scammer called, impersonating as an Amazon merchandise officer and offered assistance to cancel fraudulent transactions made by another person using my account". The scammer read out the details of real recent purchases and other "fake" transactions. Next, he asked for email address, OTP and card number in order to "cancel the many transactions". After the "first cancellation", I felt that something was amiss and questioned for verification of cancellation which he did not provide but continued with processing the "second cancellation". when I pursued further, he could not continue and eventually, hung up the phone. I immediately called the bank and the operation cancelled the only one transaction (in inr currency) made by the scammer under global garments trader. finally, the bank proceeded to cancel my card. no money was lost. ** the scammer is a male who spoke with a heavy indian accent. his number: +65 67640106
Received text msg from this number ±62 898 8216 029 for a part-time job and was told to contact this number +6589465399 . I know its a scam so I contacted the number via WhatsApp. A lady ask my name age and location. I give a fictitious name and age. After that they sent a link asking me to open it and sent a screenshot afterwards. I ever did once and after I sent the screenshot. They went blank and did not reply any of my msg. The link they sent was very suspicious
I have applied to a job opening in indeed as customer service manager at the software practice. I then received a WhatsApp message from their HR director Jones Delia in which he proceed to ask me job related questions to assess my suitability for the role which i had applied for. Throughout our correspondence, starting from 3 September 9am+ to 4 September 10am, the questions. Started off with job related questions followed by casual questions and then introducing me to this investment. The recommended funds to invest for a start is usd $500 to $1000. In our conversation, there is no signs of arranging for any interviews as the next follow up action but rather on selling the investment plan. After many pushback and rejections from my end that I am not keen in any investment as my priority now is looking for a career change and investment is the last thing on my mind, the HR director just replied "ok" and no further responses from him.
SMS sent from 95807526 claimed that they are from MOH. Contact me due to covid issues. Request for call back to them. once the phone was pickup it was a china guy speaking and obviously not MINISTRY OF HEALTH services agent. Please be aware that there is such a scam.
Got a call saying, DBS card blocked. Need IC number to unblock and I could expect to be for scammer to ask for my OTP. Beware!
I found the source in some random FB investment group and introduced to this 'sifu' (LIANGJIAN) so called US expert investor who involve in holding and managing some big index fund in china. (probably not even his real name). firstly, you have to verify yourself with his admin's assistant, typically the profiles use photos of pretty girls; thru their own kyc procedure (screenshot of your trading account/ phone call/ texting). After that, you will be added to this WhatsApp group where the 'sifu' will share daily tips teaching you how to be successful on trading and kept sharing their past achievement. when the time is right. the assistant will pm each of the member their buy call and ask the member to screenshot if they have purchase the stock successfully. everything must align with their strategy or else they will kick the member out of the group. so i deposited $10k and execute the call tips from the admin. the next day, I realise it's a pump and dump and lost 30~40% of my money. when i text the 'sifu' and the assistant again, i got kick out from WhatsApp group and I couldn't contact them anymore. therefore, never think of getting rich in short amount of time. learn how to trade wisely by reading book and article not from 'sifu'.
Someone who claimed the above name called and said he's from MOH, saying he's informing that all of my phone devices under my name will be cut by NIC (he claimed it's a government body).

Received a call from a person claiming to be from the Police. Claimed that he was helping to check on our bank accounts to make sure we are not scammed. At this point I said I will call the police directly and hung up.
The person got contact me through indeed.com whether i am interested in the job. Then, during the weekends she represented that she's HR from Unisteel technologies limited. Her name is Jessica. During the covid19 pandemic, they can only contact the candidate through WhatsApp and some more told me that she's Singaporean Chinese. Initially, I didn't suspect her as she kept me asking about the related to interview questionnaires. She asked me I can understand "Chinese “or not. She kept on using Chinese except for initially she introduced me as in English. Then, she said she had meeting and she will message me around 7pm. During around 8pm on Saturday, she contacted me again and just looked like very friendly questions like how's your dinner, etc? I politely answered and then, she said she has side job and she did do the stock share. And asked me whether i am interested in or not. I told her that "it's so dangerous that I am not familiar with". She told me she can teach me and asked me to download the apps. I suddenly asked her 1 question that are you working outstation? She said last time she used to work in Australia and that's why her WhatsApp did not change to local no. I told her I have something on &amp; off the message.Next day morning, she WhatsApp me and asked me whether I downloaded the apps or not and she said I missed the chance of being making money, etc. After that I blocked her. It's a bit annoying to me even though i didn't lose anything.
SCAM call received this morning impersonating DBS robocall message telling me my account got problem , and bank trying to reach me long time, but my phone number was engaged all the time. My account needed rectification for payment. I felt that something was not right as the bank seldom call from such masked number +65. I hung up the call.
Contacted via an unsolicited WhatsApp msg via a foreign number starting with +213, informing me about a job opportunity that i can take up easily, high salary, work from etc., and a link to start a WhatsApp msg with sg number +65 8916 5686. I googled the profile pic under this number and sure enough it belongs to a Taiwan influencer or similar, obviously a stolen pic. As my cousin was recently cheated more than $600 over similar job scams like this, I am beyond frustrated that these scams are continuing to operate and I urge everyone to please be wary and always google for info if unsure. If something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Never do any direct bank transfers to a person you have never/just met. If you need to purchase something online, always go through official online payment channels (via official Lazada, Shopee, Qoo10 website) so that it can be traced and secured and reported if indeed is a scam. Once any money is transferred, be prepared to never see it again as these scammers are fast and work in groups. They might let you think it works by doing what they promised just once, to gain your trust, then whatever happens next would be worse. Please be vigilant and always ask your trusted family members or friends to first google info for you before committing to anything new.
A person called me and communicated in Mandarin. he said I have a quarantine order because I went to tan tock seng hospital a few days prior, which I didn't. He proceeded by giving me a "quarantine number" and said that he was from MOH, however he refused to provide his English name. The information I lost was my Chinese name and phone number. he said that he was sure I had a quarantine order because he had my other identification documents. however, he refused to tell me what the numbers on my identification documents were. I called MOH to reconfirm and found out I had no quarantine order.
I would like to share These 3 unpleasant online dating cases that have happened on me. 1st encountered was last year in July whom i met David li who claimed himself to be singaporean but was raised in Us. when i met him via the single50' and he claimed he is an oil rig engineer in turkey job site. we chatted for 3 months later and last year at the covid period, he said his project has been delayed and couldn't go back home and his children at us home faced financial issues with daily expenses and learning cost. He requested me to help him to transfer to his nanny. Unfortunately at that moment, i didn't know this was scam and thought i should help his children who are small and no parents at home. this is what the scam will do to all the women who are emotional and weak at heart. i have transferred a total of 3 times at usd6000. after receving, he MIA and no way to contact him at all. I have made police report last year. 2nd case, the scammer is richard wang who i met at CMB. he said he is a technologist (agritech} and we chatted for about 3 months, then he said he got a project won in sg by the food ava and comng to sg. however as his mum has fell down and hurt her head, got hospitalised so not he himself was able to come. he has asked his workers to come and need to sort out the ep via the agent. he claimed the agent needs at least sgd10k to process the ep urgently so that they can work in sg. he wanted me to remit the money to the agent which i have no details as all. when i rejected him, he shouted at me over the phone and then removed me from his contact. no money was lost. 3rd case, this scammer, nicholas from okc whom i thought is more genuine and real. however, he told me his sop story of his divoced with his wife in us then returned back to sg with his mum. he is a boss with his own IT consultancy company just got a project in australia. The first 2 weeks was ok when he was there, but the machine broken down and hurt himself at the site. he needed me to transfer money to him usd10k, but i didn't. All these cases are my real encounters with online dating platform which i would like to share with the ladies out there to be careful if they are really keen to get know to 'new friend' from the site who has ulterior motives.
A person by the name of Alicia Lee msg me on FB. She was using coinhako. Later on she told me she was using xeroxtraders.com (Note: Possible scam site. Do NOT click) to invest using bitcoins. The first investment was great. USD$162, I got back USD$192 in 5 days. The 2nd time onwards, they promised a 12% daily profits for USD$8k. When I reached 192k after 60 days, they ask me pay tax of USD$19.2k before they send payment. I told them why cannot deduct from my profits. They refused to release and threatened to terminate my account after 2 weeks.
Keep texting on WhatsApp via this number +85246371488 and kept asking me to do investments. Was scared and did not want to do but he kept pestering so I did. But afterwards i couldn't take out the money and had to keep topping up. He pretended to top up once for me but the transfer was edited and I did not realise then. The photos he shared with me could be found in instagram @zitianjing. When uploading money onto the investment website, NRIC photo and passport photos were also shared.
I received a call soon after I was put under quarantine order. The call was automated. first in English then Chinese. it says MOH needs you to take a PRC test 2 hours later, if any questions press 5. My guess is that someone is leaking personal information as the call coincided with my real quarantine. Before that I have never received such calls. The call showed prefix of 65 in call logs.Editor's note: Please beware of incoming calls with the "+" prefix as this is an indication that the call has originated from overseas.
Beware of fake job portal: https://www.gstoreret.com/
Like typical investment scam From paktor app, he asked me to move to another platform for chatting. So I did. I was skeptical when he said he likes me and such. I simply don't believe love at the first sight. But however, I didn't mind making friend. I spoke to him and he got me to crytocurrency and asked me to invest with small amount first. Later in, as I got the taste of the easy earning, he lured me into investing with more money. I deposited 7k and subsequently, he asked me to deposit more, e.g. 20k. He deposited 20k (this gave me a red flag that it might be a scam) While my money was in the crypto app. Ofc when i contacted the customer service, they'd tell I that I didn't hit the transaction volume. My money will never be returned. Moral of the story: Do not be greedy.
Typical scam call which ask you to select "3". Stating that there Is important message from MOH. The call will be directed to another operator speaking in Mandarin who will help to verify with you what is the message. He will start by asking for name, which i gave a fake one. Later i asked for information to verify that he is a real public servant. He stated The address of MOH at at Outram park, and unable to verify his identity. He hang up the call after I told him that he is a scammer and that I have recorded the conversation.
I received an automated voice calls and claimed to be from MOH, asking me to press 3 to proceed. The number is +6594854995. The robocall was in English and Mandarin but as I suspected that it was a scam, I did not proceed further. I received phone calls from MOH when I had dealings with them previously but never in robocalls. I checked online and found there is MULTIPLE sharing on similar experience. BE CAREFUL and not to share ANYTHING. call MOH for verification.
A lady contacted me via LinkedIn informing me they have received my job application. As I was sending out a number of applications, I didn't specifically check it out. Another lady messaged me via WhatsApp and said she is representing "Lim &amp; Tan Securities Pte Ltd", I did find it weird as to why did a Hong Kong number claimed to be the HR messaged me, as nowadays a lot of companies are operating as WFH basis, so I didn't question much, it started to get weirder when this lady messaged me thru the weekend and have another man to WhatsApp me claiming he is John Lim, the boss of the company, I was alerted when he spelt my name wrongly and even though I corrected him, he still did the same thing and even spelt his company name wrongly. and so I went online to check on my job application and realised that I didn't applied for a position in Lim &amp; Tan Securities Pte Ltd and the person who messaged me earlier had her account removed and being the LinkedIn page for Lim &amp; Tan Securities Pte Ltd posting was replaced by another person who is just an admin assistant. I believe a company posting on LinkedIn won't be posted by an admin assistant and so I questioned the lady and called her and she didn't picked up the call and both the guy and the lady were blocked by me and they changed their display photos right after that.
I received a call from +6582911449, the call is an automated alert in mandarin, stating that I am placed under stay home notice and alert me to wait on the line to talk to someone. I put down the phone and checked my trace together app and realized that I have no alert.
Scammer called and claim that you have participated in a lucky draw and won the third price of HKD 500K and that she will informed the admin to deposit the amount to your bank acc. she asked for details such as your full name, IC number and banking details. She talked for a long time and advised you if you think that she is a scammer and that to keep out from telling your family and friend in case the amount is not yours, She seemed friendly and think she is a Taiwanese. Following, she will call you everyday to update you on the progress and that the admin is still working on it to transfer to your banking account. due the end, she will say that you did not answer the call from the admin and thus need to wait a few more days. in one of her call, she will act as if there is a call to her and let u hear their conversation to prove that they are real. please do not believe them. Finally, she will ask you to contact the overseas bank to verify your details. i told her that i am not interested and she seems to be angry and frustrated.
Targets seem to be struggling malaysians who have been stuck in sg since covid. My cousin was scammed but he is not online-savvy so i’m writing this on his behalf. Referred by a friend, said that she has been doing this “online business/job” for awhile and earning good money, she asked me to join so i did. Was given contacts via Whatsapp. Told me to make screenshots of products to purchase on their behalf. I first transferred $109 to UOB account name “Gaya” for a phone and got the amount back with 5% commission. With one successful transaction i felt confident to continue. Second request was a phone priced at $605. I followed similar instructions and transferred to UOB account name “Ruvy”. Then I was told that I made a mistake, it was indicated as 3 units, so it should be $1815. I told them i don’t have that much money. The same friend told me that she will help me by transferring the balance. Now that I looked at her screenshot, it seems suspiciously fake. I was told to transfer another $1,815 and then we would be able to get all of our money back, with commission. I considered doing it at first as i wished to help my friend too. My cousin told me not to because she has seen other stories here online and realized that this is part of a scam.

1. Received a call on Whatsapp from the scammer 2. Stated it was the Singapore police 3. Felt it was a scam because it was a whatsapp call and the first question was "How is your day going?" 4. Hung up and blocked the number
This happened to a close friend of mine. He is still trying to recover from this scam. They met on FB. Scammer introduced herself as Christy Koh. Claimed that her father passed away, mother is sick in sg. She's a chemical engineer and a sub contractor to Marteks oil llc. She just won a contract with evergrand energy hk llc to refine crude oil. She is currently working in Amsterdam and trying to export her crude oil products over to evergrand. Very quickly she asked to move to whatsapp and chat. They chatted only at specific timing due to 'time difference'. She always showed concern about his daily life and work. It turned romantic very quickly and she claimed that she will be back to sg soon. And she will introduce her mother to him. A month later, she requested him to transfer her 35k euro so that she can perform the sgs dip test for her oils. He had his doubts, questioned and eventually blocked her. But she continued to use other numbers to call and msg, begging for him to help her out. Very manipulative and always play the pity card. Eventually, he gave in. However, a few weeks later she continued to ask for more money, claiming that there's problems with the testing and needed to pay a huge tax fee. After doing a google reverse image check, found out she is a scammer because her photos are all stolen from a korean instagramer - @yesbee92 and the company - evergrand energy hk llc doesn't have a company website. She has contacted him using these numbers- +65 84319259, +65 86197359, + 65 97156568, +65 86197349. She also has several fb accounts under the name christykoh. And an instagram account @christy_koh11. He lost more than 50k, all of his hard earned money. It was a painful lesson. if you ever encounter such person, please block. Also, please do not engage anyone with the number starting with +65 at the front. It is not a local number. And always insist to do video calls to ensure that the person is who she/he claimed she/he is.
Day 1, I approached a part time job offer, and it was posted as an admin job. the first day went well and i got a fair amount of money for the work done. Day 2, I continued doing the job. but somehow it required me to top up money to continue 'working' and to get back the deposit. in the heat of the moment, I did not think through and continued to top up money. all i wanted was to get back my deposit, but it spiralled out of control. there were indeed many tell tale signs in this incident which I missed as I got too engaged in the incident I lost a total of 6,000 SGD from this incident.
Random number contacted me via whatsapp 1st time it was +65 8213 0872 , the person (Alice) asked how I was but did not tell me who she is, hence I did not reply her 2nd time it was +65 8213 0873. This person (Eva) asked me it was looking for part time job and that they were referred to me by a third party advertising company When asked what do they do, Eva replied: We are an online platform developer representative. We help the app to increase its popularity and usage. When you complete the registration and follow our requirements, you can get commissions. Do you need to participate? This is similar to the job scam i was previously involved in. Hence I knew straight away it was a scam I wanted to know if this was the same one I was involved, so i wanted to know more details but Eva refused to reply me anymore regarding the job BTW this is another scam number too. Lionel +65 8904 1939. saw this on Facebook and this is what their scam is about when i asked them: thank you for contacting H5 platform. our agent will contact your shortly to assist you in your job enquiry. (we are the platform itself, the agent of allocated merchants will contact you once assigned. thank you)
I have got the call in Whatsapp from the above number stating as "MOM" office . They have requested for my FIN number and I have not shared anything to them and cut the call.
I was looking for personal loan in the internet. I was searching for money lender online came across this contact and called this person (Zac/Zack/Jack/Jac) for loan. He told me they are licensed money lender and told me about the loan process and repayment plan and asked me to send over my personal details such as NRIC, bank statement and payslip etc. The website looked very legit and trusted, therefore I have submitted all my documents for a quote. The next moment he has transferred $2500 into my account and informed me the loan has been APPROVED. I was so shocked that told him that was asking for a quote first before confirming to accept. He told me that the loan has been APPROVED, that is why he has transferred to my account. I told him that I have never confirm/agree if to take up the loan and only asking for a quote. I insisted he take the money back and he told me that if I were to transfer back, I have to transfer him back $5000 and I asked him back why need to transfer $5000 whereby he only transferred $2500 to my account. He is getting inpatient, yelled, and threatened at me and told me he is loanshark. He told me that if I don’t transfer him back $5000, he will ask someone to come my house and my office to do illegal things that loanshark always do that failed to return money. He threatens me that he has all my personal information, and they can do whatever they want. From there I got to know that all these information on the website were fake and got scam. I called my bank to tell them about the problems that I have faced and made a police report immediately. I now only knew that licensed money lenders are not allowed to advertise their services online and that it will always be safer to acquire a loan at their actual office instead of doing it online. I did not know that this was a scam as this is my first time trying to acquire a loan.

I was contacted on telegram by Diana asking if i was looking for a part-time job, and when I responded ok, her boss, elaine, contacted me on Whatsapp to see if I'm interested to know more. upon finding out the job description, it seems too suspicious to be true. she introduced me to this website "www.ddas.live" where I can "grab orders" and earn commission. How this works: 1) create an account under her referral, 2) give her my referral for her to sign up, 3) HELP her account TO GRAB 40 ORDERS FIRST which earn my account commissions, 4) using the 20% comms from what i did in her account, i tHEN have $60-80 of commissions in my account, GO TO MY ACCOUNT AND FINISH 40 ORDERS BEFORE I CAN WITHDRAW the principal and commissions money. To complete 40 orders, halfway through you will get a negative balance, and means you need to top up by contacting the customer service +65 89124534, also the number they gave as their "company number". i stopped here as i felt suspicious throughout and did not want to provide any further personal details or money. i believe this scam works by locking your money away, lets you withdraw some commission and the principal, but then afterwards the order amount gets large enough that you have to keep topping up.. $1000+...$10,000+... and so on. then maybe one day, you cannot withdraw. Suspicious points: 1) from the website, it claimed to be under "ey international group", giving sg address of ey. but SG PHONE GIVEN IS THE ABOVE CUST SVC NUMBER, NOT EY OFFICE NUMBER. Australian address is of some "engineered door solutions" company. 2) the truth is.. ey, who is big4 accounting firm, will never do order-grabbing business. ey is also not called ey international group. trying to use the name of ey to build credibility to scam people has failed them. 3) if it is ey... a professional firm... why would company's introduction not mention anything, uses colored font with multiple icons etc. totally low level UI design that is randomly put together 4) "invitation code" is spelled as "lnvitation code", and when u login successfully, the pop up spells "loginged" etc. bad spelling found in multiple places. 5) googled the customer service number, saw another recent scam alert for this same order grabbing. Although the agent/user mentioned she had been doing it for a few months, i'm not convinced. I even warned her to be careful too after I told her I will not be doing it. Be wary, if you need to top up with your own cash. nothing comes easy, especially money.
An incoming voice recorded phone received on my mobile from +65 93057689 @ 1409Hrs. Robocall claimed to be from MOH 卫生部 and Said It's regards to Covid. The instruction is to press 3 to continue the call. I hesitated since I thought I may be called due to close contact with Covid infected cases. However, decided to hang up instead as it sounded like a scam.
Moh impersonation haunting and phishing line : +65 8201 7544 Background Local handphone number call my mobile. It's a robocall that claimed to be from "MOH" and asked me to press digit 3. After pressing, the Chinese operator ask for all my information and I tried to verify the road and address of MOH, which they are very familiar. Modus operandi: a bunch of Chinese nationals in a true blood of traditional Chinese accent, they don't speak like local Chinese. They know what we are trying to verify and able to fend off first level of verification. Their aim is to get hold of your information. The moment they gave up: when you press on into further details on their intention, they gave up and hang up the line. They simply have no patience to phish further. Thus there is no loss for me but they sounded very convincingly, which I believe other folks may fall into their prey easily. Beware of such impersonation phone scams.
He advised me that my MOM application had a problem and requested me to provide my FIN number. Told him that I don't have it, he then asked forcefully for my IC. I hang up on him. There was a lot of background noise with other people talking. also sounded like they had an Indian accent.
I have received a call this morning and a guy with china chinese accent introduced himself as a MOH staff. He asked me where i stay and he will be arranging people to bring me for quarantine. According to his contact tracing record, i have contact with covid patient on 20/08/21 at ktph, which i didn’t go. I sensed something fishy and I just cut him off, he is using +6583652242 at 1st and soon after +6582292020 followed. I have blocked these 2 numbers and nothing was lost.
SCAMMER NUMBER: +6596583248 The scammer called and it was a Chinese speaking lady which is very polite. Introduced herself as one of the MOH personnel and is able to verify my ic number when i gave her a fake ic number. she mentioned that I had bought some medicine at Guangzhou on 16 aug for covid19 and its being detained in Guangzhou. after which she just go on to inform me about it. The whole call was off. Editor's note: Please beware of incoming calls with the "+" prefix as this is an indication that the call has originated from overseas.
I was contacted on telegram asking if i was looking for a part-time job and to contact this person on Whatsapp if I'm interested to know more. I did, and this lady called Amy introduced me to this website where i can 'grab orders' and earn commissions. The website is under this company claiming to be "EY Group". How it works is that I have to help the person who referred me to grab 40 orders first then go to my account and finish 40 orders before i can withdraw money. Sometimes i will have to recharge/top up the account with my own money by contacting their 'customer service' (+65 8912 4534) which random bank accounts will be given each day or will change every now and then. When i withdraw, all top up and commission will be sent to my bank account. I only did this for a day but it was already very sketchy. On the first day i earned $70+, $130+ if inclusive of my top-up amount, the second day i was super skeptical when they asked me to top up close to $400 so i stopped. Thank goodness i only made a $40 loss. I see some other agents in the group chat recharging 1k+ into their account but I'm not convinced. I read up on some scams on order grabbing and am still not sure if this is a legitimate business. Please beware of random job offers especially if it requires a deposit from your own account.
Received a scam call. at first they tell me they are from the Singtel and ask me how is the internet connection . then they said there are a lot of activities from my router and they want to fix it.(they suspected there are other parties using the internet). then they ask me to type some command from the computer - the command they ask me to type is "assoc " and they told me my CLSID number. then another commad "netstats" . the last they ask me is whether i know the administration ID and password for the computer. I realize that that is the scam call. didn't provide them that number.
This person DM me via IG about two years ago. Her IG was named as Karen Dina. She claimed to be model and nurse. She asked me to continue conversation in Wechat and added her ID - Keiichi_jun. I saw a lot of red flags in our conversations as she seemed to have a lot of time. Like copy and paste her chats. She sent me selfie photos but was unable to comply to my requests when i asked her to take photo of her place and environment etc. Then, suddenly she was in Dubai for gold investment and claimed to lose her wallet. She wanted to borrow $200 and promised to return it as soon as she came back to Singapore. I didn't send any money to her and stopped contacting her. Later, I checked her IG again and saw her change IG name (now Jeannette Talor Tan), and also different faces. Damn, I should play her out and got her bank details so I could report to police. So I thought I better leave both her IG and Wechat ID here in case she tries to scam others again. Maybe it's not female person. Be careful when meeting someone online.
I found the job ads on Facebook claiming to pay $20 for 60 grab jobs for Lazada , Shopee. I was referred to Whatsapps 891152?? May Ng, then asked to add Siti 80115028 . SITI asked for my personal information to sign up. I started clicking for Siti 60 jobs and get commission of $30 and then was asked to login in my account to start clicking another 60 jobs. After finish the 60 job, when I clicked withdraw but the platform rejected my withdrawal for no reason. I Whatsapp-ed Siti and may but no reply from them.
Online work-from-home advertisement Job scope attached you have to create an account and load it with real money. To cash out, you have to do 20 orders. This website is called 1688.care at the start, there is payout once I helped amy. After a few days, she will ask you to create your account to do these 20 orders. That’s when the scam starts. The order amount is ridiculously large, to the extent where it is more than my school fees. I wanted to cancel my account and get back the money but was unable to do so from the website. Both Amy and customer service told me to carry on as i was close to finishing the 20 orders. I insist that i want to stop. They say if i cancel my account, i can only get back 70% and will be done in 24-48hrs. I ok with it but until now no news at all. Amy blocked me too found a new number also scam : 890419??
Just received a call from robocall that told me to press 3 and someone speaking Chinese claiming to be from "MOH" informed that someone USED my name (I gave a false name) to send false covid news in china. then they asked me to write down a bunch of details of the registered phone number in shanghai before "forwarding" me to "shanghai police". The "policeman" asked a bunch of questions, then asked me to search for shanghai police station before showing me the official website's contact number and called me back spoofing that number and claiming that he will record a "statement" from me before he can investigate this impersonation fraud. i hung up and he called me multiple times and even whatsapp me which i ignore and report on whatsapp.
I received a call from +65 8888 0330. The robot said it was a call from minister of health. press 1 for english,... Since it will be easier for me to converse in english I pressed 1. but a lady from the other side said all English speaking officer are busy so she attended to me. She sound very professional and polite. She asked me to clarify my full name which I gave her. She said upon checking, I should have received SMS from MOH that I have be quarantined. (i did not received the SMS, but somehow today SMS came in later than normal, credit card OTP which I requested at 9am came in only at 9.44am) So I thought the SMS might come in later. I asked why I need to be quarantined. According to her, because I requested Covid medicine at Guangzhou hospital on 16 Aug. I said I did not and she asked me where I was on 16 Aug. She also asked to clarify my number and my full name again. She insisted that the medicine was collected by me and with my contact details that's why MOH contacted me. She also asked where i was on 16 Aug. I told her I was at work. She then said someone collected on my behalf and to be send to my local address. She then said the medicine is now being held by China custom as covid patient should seek help from within the country first. I insisted that I did not ask anyone to collect anything from Guangzhou. She then asked is I misplaced my identity before like ID or passport. After 7 minutes talking to her, I suddenly realized that her story is not consistent. Why in the beginning she said I collected the medicine myself and afterward said the medicine was collected on my behalf and to be sent to me. I immediately off the call. and +60 13 259 520 called me afterward which I did not answer. I have given up my name, phone number and location on 16 Aug to her. Hope everyone will be more careful especially at this time

A guy picked up the phone and he asked for my details to which I unknowingly gave my name and NRIC Number as "he will check it in his records" He said that I was involved in moneylaundering and I was a suspect, The guy told me that I have a hearing this. I got very concerned. He said that he would call me again as he needed to forward this to another department.I tried searching FB if this is really legit and saw somebody posted this might be a scam.I called the Supreme High Court and they said this was a scamHere are the phone numbers:- +06121660 (robocall and moved to another guy)- +67040965833 (2nd time that the guy called where I told him angrily he was scammer)

I called up MOH at 1pm on the same day to verify and they referred me to this website to report. MOH has helped me to report this as police case.
First got acquainted with this person when he slided into my DMS. Had a few brief exchanges after which he disappeared for some time. A few days ago, he decided to catch up under the pretense to know me better and along the way, he threw in an offer that he’d introduced/guide me to bitcoin. I have been a skeptic as I do not have any knowledge in the crypto world but played along (on that note, I was made aware of scams after doing my research online). He later sent me a link and asked that i download the app. I have ignored him since because I find it too good to be true. Was hoping that the general public can have the necessary resources to identifying these scammers.
Scammer contacted me on whatsapp to purchase my used camera and lens to be shipped to one address in the Philippines. i was cautious at first and scammer assured me money will be sent via PayPal and released once packaged was received. by the time i realised the PayPal payment was faked, I had already sent out the package via Fedex. Fedex Singapore was unhelpful in stopping and returning the package. they merely put up the halt request and even after I told them the pacage is on the delivery van, still repeated the same message to assure me. giving up on them, I called Fedex philppines and successful halt and got back my package in time. the scammer has been active for sometime, see forum thread below. he frequently changed his mobile number and gmail address, but the address in the Philippines are consistent. Address: B18 L16 avida residence sta catalina, salawag. City: Dasmarinas, Cavite, Postal code: 4114 Philippines. Ph: 09260221065 https://www.clubsnap.com/threads/classified-section-scams.1754616/page-2
Trying to buy a Midea fridge which cost lesser than the market rate by about $100 on Shopee.. Was trying hard to really check out the detail they provided, cos they actually scan their delivery guy ic (front n back) to me claimed is it safe and a warehouse address in sg... Guess I needed the fridge fast which they claimed can be same day delivery, i fell for it... After the transferred of $$$, they mentioned in order to clear the customs, will need another $200 n this will be return after the delivery. While I didn't fall prey to the scam further, I thought it was careless of me to allow the conversation to be taken out of Shopee app. I should have stopped the communication straight away.Please take note if a seller insists on conversing outside the shopping app or demand instant transfer payment n no cash on delivery, just end the deal. Found out that the seller is since "ban" in Shopee.
A phone call informing me that I needed to be quarantined and asked me to press '3' to proceed and call was diverted to an operator.
Received a friend's invite on Facebook. After I replied, he asked if I heard of lCIF, World bank and Facebook on cash benefits. Claimed to receive 250k. Names are randomly selected. Offer to help me apply. I checked with my friend. He informed me his Facebook account has been used more than once by scammer. Received message asking me to click on this link https://fb.me/worldwidewinningsroom (Note: Scammer's profile. Do not respond to the messages from this profile)
I was approached on Carousell pertaining my watch listings at around 3pm on 20th August 2021. The person asked for my number and texted me on whatsapp thereafter. I first suspect he is a scammer because he sounds way too zealous in trying to the deal done - usually for watches that is worth SGD 20- 30k, people will still try to negotiate a couple of hundreds off, but he did not and even said that he will round the sum up for me. He claimed that he is not in Singapore and that he wants to buy a watch for his brother as a present. Hence he will make the transfer online and ask a courier to pick up the watches. I felt that something was not right so I went in and checked his profile on Carousell and the account was created couple of hours ago before he first approached me for the watches. But because it was Singapore contact number (+65 8401 8902?, I went ahead and still chatted with him since there is a chance he might be a real buyer. He then proceeded to ask for personal information pertaining to my bank account number, name of bank account holder and address. I did not give him my full account name and gave him an office address instead. But because I told him that I didnt have the watches with me, he wanted to deal with me the next day, on 21st August 2021 morning instead. Around 10pm on 20th August, which is the day itself, I noticed that Carousell has already banned the account - so I thought I am right and that the scammer won't contact me anymore. But on the 21st August morning, the scammer continued to text me on Whatsapp and asked whether if we can deal by 4pm that day. I replied yes, saying that so long as I can sight the funds, then I will pass him the watches. Thereafter he claimed that he can only show me the receipt but the funds will only reach 1-2 days later - that is when I know that it is definitely a scam.
I was looking for personal loan in the internet. I came across a website lendin? bee and to input the loan amount i needed and my contact. Then, I received a Whatsapp from the person called eric and told me about the loan process and repayment plan and send me a contract related to the loan after i send over my details such as ic, bank statement and payslip. He told me to pay stamping fee 385 and admin fees 385 total 770 which I did. Then I received another invoice from different person from different number 8895908? to pay another 450 for account opening, if I never pay the loan approval will b on hold that’s when i realized that this must a scam and when to website to look for the company again there’s a page which is different and I read about the important notice regards to scam. I read and understand that company won’t ask for advanced payment before any loan approval. I immediately made a police report and call the bank to report as well. Its my stupidity to fall into this without calling the company to check and fall into their trap. Hopefully this ends here from this scammers. Lesson learnt.

She liked me on Facebook dating app and sent me her overseas number to add her via WhatsApp, while stating she is currently living in Singapore. I asked her why didn’t she use a local number and she said she had been using her HKG number even when she is in sg. One night she found out i was alone and asked me for video sex in a private virtual room saying that it will be fun to do it with a stranger. She also baited by saying that she would find someone else to do it if i wasn’t going to. I sensed some amiss so i reported and blocked her profile on Facebook dating, and came here to share my story so there won’t be the next unlucky victim of such cybersex extortion.
My friend introduced me to a website where you can earn a commission by purchasing an item for an anonymous person. So how it works is that, You create an account on gobigcommerce.live (Note: Scam website), and You can “top up” money there. But the top up works when you transfer the money to this “person”. You will be randomly assigned an item to buy, and it will be done automatically. however, the item purchased can go above the amount you deposit, so you may have to end up topping up the balance just to get back Your money and “commission” afterwards. (Items range from Cheap batteries to expensive jewellery) I previously made one transaction with my friend, and we profited $200 from it. So being greedy, we went ahead to top up the negative balance, when we were told our money was used to buy a more expensive item (top up was done through paynow). So this whole thing actually looked Like a scam before we started but we were blinded by the greed for the commission. So moral of the story: There is no such thing as easy money.
Someone called me to tell me that I was spreading online rumours - I asked him for proof - then he hung up on me. His second call hen claimed that he was "MOH". Said I needed to be quarantined. He cannot speak English, only Mandarin. When I asked him to speak English since he was from MOH, then he hung up on me.
I received a SMS text message about Money lending. A few days later I responded to the text to inquire about a loan. During the texting, I was asked to submit my IC number and name. The person sent me a contract that looked very legitimate. In that moment, when I needed the financial help, I signed it without realising that the draft was a fake contract. I was given a call, later in the evening, and was asked to pay $3800 in order to activate an account. This was the point where I realised I have been scammed. I decided to cancel the contract and that's when the harassing began. I received a series of aggressive Whatsapp texts, the next morning, from a different number - stating that I have to pay a cancellation fee. If I refused, they would come to my house and harass me violently. As of now, I have not lost anything financially, and I regret what has been done.
I answer a call from DHL and linked to china Beijing Chaoyang polIce officer, did’nt notice it was a scam and he instructed me to withdraw money (few times) from my saving to honk kong bank of china and hong kong bank ended up all my savIng gone (about $200,000) and I realised it was a scam already too late.

I got a call about an urgent matter from MOH. I was quite surprised since my tracetogether showed no likely contacts of covid-19. still I complied, and the man on the other end said I do not have to take the call since I don't speak Chinese.
I came across this girl on Locanto ad. I got tempted. I then proceeded to the place and she didn't show up. However another guy called me and told me to buy cards for her. I gave a copy of my NRIC as well. He kept on coming for more but I got enough of the threaten and took it as a lesson learn. the guy told me to pay him if not he would come my house and threaten my family and I thought after giving some amount of money, he would be gone but he kept on coming so I told myself: "i am very stupid to be scammed by people online" and I would like to advise everyone to be careful of these scams. I am a victim and I would not want anyone to be part of it as well. report to the police if he/she continues to harass you!
I came across a job ad on facebook offering part time job and hence, I contacted the person via the Whatsapp given. The person replied me saying he was an architect and currently in Malaysia. He needs someone who can help with paying bills &amp; also parcels to be sent to my address . Most preferably staying near post office too. to be assured, I can even open up the parcels to check the content. I questioned him why not he pays bill himself and his reply is currently in Malaysia. I told him better not be scam or illegal because I'm a lawful citizen. He promised its legit and i let my guard down. After few transactions of few hundreds, I did not smell anything fishy till there’s a transaction of $1k+, I asked if the transaction it’s ok and again, i was convinced it’s legit and never suspect anything. It’s till when I tried drawing cash from at ATM machine and realised something is not right. My account is frozen. I was wondering what went wrong and contacted the bank. It’s when I know I was scammed. The person still insisted that he was not a scammer and telling me will contact his lawyer about this matter. I even told him to go down to the police station ,explained to them and return the fund to the poor guy. Now I will wait for the police to find some clues and give my statements when need to. Never trust any job that promised easy money. Too many such scams nowadays and hope everyone can be alert and don’t be like me. Stay safe
Met this guy named Jack (China nationality), claimed to be PR in Singapore. Suspect to be romance scam. Claimed to be working either under ,or in collaboration with this company Cheekimonsta media. Persistent on persuading on trading on a platform known as Vestle. Invested once (400USD), but refused on 2nd attempt when asked to deposit $10,000. Website claimed to do event services, etc. But when called to verify they claim to be only doing videography services. This guy Jack claims to be working under a different section from the company doing live streaming on China platforms. Concerned about the validity of this company or if they are actually a scam and fraud company. Or, the owner may not know that their company has been misused by others. apparently he is called henry on tinder, and Jason on okcupid. when we chatted on Whatsapp he says he is Jack.
Received a call from a robocall that claimed to be from MOH, phone number is +65 93632471, asked to press 3 to proceed. The call was in English and Mandarin.
This happened on 2 occasion whereby the scammer sent a job opportunity via Indeed with the name as Ruel Jaza. Thereafter, it followed up with Whatsapp message from +60 111118 2438, introducing herself as lee (partial name) and is a HR manager of Wilmar international. Coincidentally, my friend is working in that company, and had confirmed that his company does not have such person and normally their company will use official email for communication.
I received a call from a number +65 9528131?. (yes, it has a +65 in front, which is already suspicious) it started off with an automated voice message saying that i have a very important message from the Ministry of Health related to covid-19. thereafter, a male Chinese person spoke. he spoke in Mandarin with a very thick PRC accent, so I doubt he is Singaporean. i am Malay and I could not understand what he was saying. even after i told him in Mandarin that I was a Malay and couldn't understand a thing he said. He still continued speaking in mandarin. not being able to understand what he said, I hung up. i am sharing this experience here because this caller has tried to use MOH's name to try and attract people to talk to him. Please be careful.

i am a malaysian living in singapore, female 38 years old. Yesterday morning (13 August 2021) I received a phone call made from Singapore local number to my Singapore SIM card stated that it is from Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH). He told me that my passport has been registered in Shanghai, China mobile and has been identified spreading a fake Covid-19 text messages and its an heavy offence. He then offered to transferred my call to 'Shanghai Interpol Office' to lodge my police report. The man who answered the call then asked for my Whatsapp phone number (which is registered under my Malaysia simcard) he texted me his Police Employee Card with picture identify himself as 'Officer Zhang, He then asked me to send him through WhatsApp my passport front picture as he needed to carry on the investigation. I was panic at that moment and did not recognized it was a scam and sent him my passport copy front page showing my signature. He then told me to hold the line and when he came back he said he has also identify my passport number has a China Bank account that associated with money laundering. I was again in shock. He kept asking me questions like where I might use my passport before or have I lost it. And he asked if I have any bank account in Singapore? I told him no, and only have bank accounts in Malaysia. He asked for the names which I provided. But I did not disclose the bank details such as numbers or ATM cards. He then told me I need to cooperate with him so he can assist me. He informed me that he will contact me back 3 hours later as he will have a 'meeting' with his superior on how to have this issue handle. it was 12:30 noon when we hang up. He told me not to share this information about the call with anyone even my family. As soon as he hang up, I immediately contacted MOH hotline and they told me it is definitely fraud as they did not make such call. a police report has been made immediately and i am trying to contact the Malaysian Embassy in Singapore as well because my identity has been compromised.
I had received a call in the morning on 13 August 2021 from my house phone. a recorded message in Chinese stating there is a quarantine order, instructing to press 9 to continue. I did not do so and let the call continue till it ended by itself. I only managed to record a bit of the message.
Received a call that is a voice recording telling me I need to contact MOH urgently and it's related to COVID-19. I should press a button to talk to MOH.
I was searching for room rental and had posted my info in this website(https://rentinsingapo??.com.sg/).I received many legitimate offers but one of them was an obvious scam. He introduced himself as Ahmed. He claimed to have moved abroad due to work circumstance and is trying to find someone to take over his apartment. He gave me an HDB block address but the photos of the unit have condo furnishing and has a bathtub which is rare in HDB units.The rental fee is also too good to be true for a master's bedroom. There were too many red flags. But what really gave it away is when he asked me to buy itunes card. If someone ask you to buy itunes card, never trust them! I hope that this information will help you spot the danger before it's too late.
My family member got the following SMS from UOB. "A new payee has been added today. If this was not you secure your account: secure-uo?.com" (Note: Phishing website) Sender's ID is the same as usual message from uob bank, but this one looks suspicious since we didn't t add any new payee recently. We didn't click on the link and emailing UOB to inform them of this phishing attempt.
Claim to be MOH with multiple important not treated documents in English and Chinese. Ask press 3 . It was clearly a scam call.
Someone called claiming to be from Starhub. saying that there is a high activity from my internet overseas for the past few days. and i am at risk of a cybercrime attack. He asked me to download a software on my laptop called ultraviewer and taught me the steps to see the activity via cmd. was told to key in netstat in cmd to see the internet activities from other countries. He then told me that he would my call to the cybercrime officer to help me with it. I was told to provide my name, dob, address, email and contact number. which i did. I only came to realise that it was a scam when he asked me to log in to DBS online via my laptop.. i told him i am not comfortable in doing it since I am open to cybercrime now. he kept pushing me by telling me to log in so that he could teach me how to transact safely. I refused and told him to give me his contact number so that I could back to verify. but he refused and asked me to follow his instructions so i went online to search for cybercrime scam via my computer laptop and refused to login to dbs as per his request. i I told him I would call the police myself to solve this problem and hang up the phone. but i have no idea if he has access any information from my laptop or not. after i hang down the phone, I restarted my laptop and uninstall the app that they asked me to download. i also called up Starhub to check on my internet activities and they told me it is fine. no unusual activities. I also went to make a police report.
Came across this Facebook post stating that they were selling Dyson vacuum cleaners for only $3. However, another member of our local cyber security group on Facebook has approached the manufacturer to authenticate the promotion. the manufacturer stated that it was unaware. Preliminary observations show that it affects mobile users only as desktop users would be redirected to a survey form instead. once a mobile user has accessed the link, it asks for personal information like credit card details, etc. there is no way a vacuum cleaner would only be going for $3 even if it is indeed a clearance sale, especially from a reputable brand. as of 8:34pm 10 Aug 2021, the Facebook post in question has had several people that fell for it.
Today I received a msg from Ninja van S’pore informed I have a parcel that cost $130/- (COD), however, I did not place any online purchase recently. Parcel delivered to my doorstep this afternoon, the lady asked for $130/- to release the parcel, we have rejected this parcel, as I am sure I did not place online order. Pls beware this is scam possible.
On the last day of my SHN (29 Jul), I received a call from the number +6586385034 in the afternoon, claiming they are from the “MOH”. Initially, I was talking to a Chinese speaking guy and he checked my ic number and says my vaccination status will be revoked as my name has been involved in a crime. After that, it got changed to another guy claiming to be the officer in charge. He introduced himself and said that the call is recorded and they are official. They accused me of using an overseas phone tagged under my name that was spreading Covid-related information to Singapore citizens and that they need me to personally make a police report to shanghai Pudong police station. When I closed the call, the person called back again and questioned my attitude towards them. They threaten over the phone that this is a serious case and need me to cooperate. I repeatedly told them that I can’t be in shanghai last month to register a shanghai line and the person then asked me to report this ‘case’ to the china police station, which he connected over to the China line. Once I was connected with the Chinese side, which was done connected via “MOH” officials, a Chinese man claimed to be the police officer greeted me. Out of fear, I repeated what the MOH officer told me to report to the policeman and didn’t think much at that moment. The policemen say he needs me to repeat this over again via the ‘proper channel’ and he asked how did I get his number. I told him that MOH connected the line. He then made me go to a website on google to search for “上海浦东分局”(shanghai Pudong branch) and click on their ‘official’ website to check for the international contact number below the website. Then the same policemen called me back again to make me verify that he’s calling from the ‘official’ police station. The scammers continued to trick me to believe that I am involved in an international money laundering crime. From then on, there're series of traps I fell into and the scammers has successfully cheated SGD$35,000 from me via online banking. It was too late when I realised that it was a scam.
Came across this ad on FB offering Dyson vacuum cleaners at $3. I've checked with the real Dyson company in Singapore and they claimed that such promos aren't run by them! Scammers are using social media to look for victims, so beware and not be fooled by such unbelievable deals!
I found this fast job where the said i could earn up to 600/hour and i thought why not give it a try? Without thinking it was a job scam i made the first few transactions which were successful, but then things slowly started to get iffy, they started saying i was overtime for a mission (that mission costed me 1.7k) and i had to pay another 3k to get me my refund. After i paid 3k they said i needed to do 2 overtime missions, 1 was the 3k and another was me having to pay another 9k just for them to be able to refund me my money. Ok, I borrowed from my friend and i paid them like they said. But then they told me that their system "sometimes" uses a round off system which they did not inform me before i confirmed my full refund amount with them and so they said my account was locked as a result, and they tried making me pay another 8k to unlock my account but no I decided to call my bank and lodge a police report immediately. Heard from someone else in the group they could make you pay up to 16k just to get your refund back but that's crazy.
I received a call from the number +6566793147 in the morning, claiming they are from the MOH. Initially, I was talking 1 guy but it got changed to another guy claiming to be the officer in charge. They accused me of using an overseas phone tagged under my name that was spreading covid-related information to parts of shanghai and that my PR status will be cancelled in 2 hours and they are just calling to inform me that. When I asked them if I could see any related emails or documents, they tried to distract me by questioning my attitute towards them and not answering the question of where my birth country is. hopefully this helps others out there
Caller started off in Mandarin, and claimed to be from "MOH". I was suspicious as the caller couldn't speak Mandarin. Please stay vigilant and always verify the caller's identity!
Scammer pretends to be from singtel alert! number +659753101 Caller claimed that my wifi received complaints and reason of my wifi issue is that there are 25 other people tapping onto my wifi and use. For him to check and retify the problem, i have to follow his instruction. I asked for verification to determine he is from singtel, he first sigh and then replied softly gibberish enough for me to already suspect. 1st sign was that he instructed me to search for 'terminal' in mac . at this moment another hint to suspect his next step is indeed for me to type a certain codes which then enable him to control my computer and possibility of hacking further. of course i did not bother to type anything he instructed in my terminal. when he asked have you typed in those.. i said no not yet, i am still trying to verify and check if you are from singtel. Immediately he gave off a 2nd sigh and hang up. I have called Singtel to verify if there is any call record on their end of such engagement, zero call from Singtel. Moreover, singtel does not call you if you have internet issues. it is the owner of the problem whom will be calling Singtel. - take note! They will not do such personal follow-up when you complain on the fb. this scammer must have gotten my number from Fb (in which my fb profile contact details are hidden), seeing the comment gave in singtel fb page. Hope that my story will help alert fellow citizens of this scam!
Caller claims to be from Singtel and that detected from their "CENTRAL SERVER" that my information has been stolen. I asked for verification and he tried to tell me how each customer has a unique number. I cut him off before he could finish and told him I need him to verify himself - Not the other way round. He hung up.
Received a call from ‭+852 8914 438‬ HK. sounds like robocall where if you said hello they Call claimed to be from Singtel, and asked to check on my internet router. Guy spoke with strong Indian accent. This sounded so much like a scam and why would Singtel call me using an overseas number!
I received a unrequested phone call from "MOM", so i thought it was my mum calling me, and i picked up the call. but the person said, "hello madam, I'm from the MOM - you should know what is is right?" I was in a daze. why would somebody call me madam when i'm a male? I replied "yes" and he told me that my bank account was being hacked into and needed immediate attention. but i knew i hadn't activated any bank accounts yet so i just replied that i can go to the bank and reset it myself, then hung up. Beware of scams everybody, and remember that bank officials never call with Viiber!
RECIEVED A PHONE CALL THIS MORNING AROUND 9AM, started with a robocall saying there's a document in MOH need to be collected, press 3 for further inquires, then after pressing 3, there is a man speaking mandarin, asking for my name and "checked in system" then say there is an undeclared package of covid-19 medicines being blocked by china customs, and i showed some doubt about this, then this guy just asked me to go to moh@16 College Road to check by myself, HOWEVER TODAY IS A SATURDAY which MOH is not supposed to be working, I asked him on this and he just said they are working, can just come. after hung up. Please beware and do not fall prey to such impersonation scam! MOH already put out an alert warning people of this ongoing scam, and that they do not use robocall to call the public. Beware guys!
Robocall received. Harsh, and telling me that they have contacted me numerous times. That I was required to get back by Asking me to press #3. Then the call got transferred to some guy. And wanted to transfer me to another person. Editor's Note: Since April 2020, a ‘+’ sign prefix will be displayed on phone screens for all international incoming calls. Domestic calls will not display the ‘+’ sign prefix.

Got a call from a guy who claimed himself from moh , who could actually pronounce my full name. I know its a scam:1) number with +65 2) he couldnt speak proper english and keep using mandarin to talk to me. He told me that on 25th july i might be exposed to covid-19 in tan tock seng hospital and will arrange for pick up for my quarantine. As i told him i was not there, he then told me did i lend my phone to someone else etc etc. I kept saying i dont know i dont know and he then hung up. I would like to report this incident as scammer nowadays probably already have your name ready to scam you. Nevertheless , stay vigilant and i hope police could really do something about this. Some vulnerable people might fall for it.
I have received a call from +6580594337 impersonating MOH. the voice message said moh is following up with the call to ask me questions about the vaccination and ask me to press "3" to connect to an officer. and the same message is repeated in mandarin. i hung up immediately as calls from the ministry will not be played through a recorded message. when I tried to call back afterwards, it says that the number is invalid. Just to share my experience on the different "forms" of impersonation. Take care, everyone!
Received email with SingPost letter head claiming that delivery cannot be made due to " no customs duty was paid". Includes a link to https://sunshinefertili??.com/wp-admin/js/widget??/
The calls started a few weeks ago by a guy, saying that he has changed a mobile numer and wishes to inform me. The voice and accent did not sound familiar and on the first call i genuinely thought it was a wrong number and told him so, and hung up. About a week later, same guy called again with a different number. i told him he got the wrong number but he knew my name and claimed that we are close friends, that he is the chubby friend whom i always speak to. unless I have amnesia of some sort there is no way i don't know my close friends. that was about when i knew this was a scam. i repeatedly asked for his name and he refused and hung up. A few days later he tried again and i promptly hung up the phone. he must have easily gotten my name and contact easily these days with info available. If someone calls you out of the blue, beware!
I came across the message asking applying job online which I did. The person asked me if I wanted to try out working from home by just clicking likes and follow a particular person on Facebook. I tried and got 2.88% comm. On the same day, they introduced me to another job, which could earn me $50 to $80 per day just by grab 60 orders per task for online purchase. To create virtual sales figures for the Taobao company. I was curious about this job offer, so from the "agent" account, I started to "grab" orders. Then at one point, I was asked to top up $385 for an account short-fall. I found the whole job suspicious and started searching for information online and found that it's an ongoing scam. I hope to share my encounter here to warn people of this scam so that they won't fall prey like me.

Receive a call claiming to be from Singtel technicians department saying that my Singtel internet has be compromised. As i just change my internet service provider to Singtel weeks ago, I didn't take notice it was a scam at first, only thing I noticed is the number they use for calling me so i hang up halfway through the conversation to have a check with Singtel customer service.
A friendly guy called from this +658041139? and said can i remember him. I said are you sky and he said yes. He said this is his new mobile nos. And asked me to delete his old nos. And saved this new number. For future contacts. He is opening a cafe and wanted to invite me for his opening soon. He said he will whatsapp me his invitation card. Next day, this guy sky called again in the morning and said he just lost his wallet and bank cards and he is in need of my help urgently to transfer $5800 to his supplier for his coffee machine delivery already at his shop. Although i asked for more info he did provide and pleaded very urgently with several calls and messages. In the end i transferred twice $1000, total $2000, before realising it was a scam. A police report was made then and i also did inform my banker for the scam.

Met him through a dating site, hinge. At first it was all good and it genuinely felt like we were making a connection. He was a hongkonger. There will usually be some kind of excuse why he can't meet up physically even if he claims to be in sg. He will say he treasures the first meeting and wants it to be special. Then after about a month, he started to ask if he could lead me to invest in cryptocurrency to help me earn money. I believe he earns some kind of commission for how much people put in to these fake crypto brokers. At first below 10000 there was no issue withdrawing money from the platform. After that they will start giving you all sorts of excuses. I also found out many others have come across such person's on dating apps sharing their experience in reddit. You can just Google "Hinge" investment scam.

Internet Love Scam; INVESTMENT SCAM The standard MO is get your whatsapp number, then start chatting with you, and very quickly "falling in love" with you. multiple countries This story was parents divorced, only child with a very strong single mother. seemingly very close to mum. all these are just there to make you let your guard down thinking they have good moral values. same for other sweet talk. This was a business whatsapp number. initially looked genuine with +65 i.e. sg but why a business account. scammer also moved quickly off the coffee meet bagel site to whatsapp claiming to use the CMB app rarely. usually flawless success story are too good to be true. if you analyse clearly, you will notice loopholes in the conversations when you ask more questions. scammers will usually try to avoid questions so that you will detect less inconsistencies in the dialogue. scammer requested to invest in cryptocurrency together to reap the lucrative profits. i count myself lucky that I was not exposed to sophiscated websites and apps with fake statistics as i read other stories with such websites. fyi might work in groups - some might be smarter than others. i m amazed at how well educated and opiniated these syndicates are. no money was lost.
I received a text message from Singpost saying I had a parcel with them and i need to pay additional $3.13 to singpost otherwise parcel will be return to sender. the screen was using Singpost logo and told to fill in my credit cards details and also the bank otp. as i always purchase on line from aliexpress and the website was so legitimate so my guards was down. however as i send my otp pin there was a delay locking on so i send a few times. until fed up without reply so i lock out. I thought case was close as my payment was unsuccessful, so i was thinking Singpost will send back the item no big deal. I then purchased an item online and paid up with my credit card. To my horror I discovered $5,056.44 was charged to my card. I immediately contacted my bank to cancel my credit card and reported to them. i knew there nothing the bank could do as they scammer using 3d method meaning once you pay with your cards and sent them the otp you are finished, they can clean out your credit cards immediately as the operate overseas in London by the time you notice your statement, it's too late. These scammers are professional it system so beware. this is the second time i got scam no matter how careful these fucking scammer always visit you with others method. i only blame myself for my foolishness and not careful. so fellow citizen beware of such scammers' tricks. Don't respond to unknown messages and always check the URL and don't click on the link found in the message!
I was looking for online part time job. And I come across this person name JIALE (+65 8946 772?) who claimed that we will be given task like boost online influencer. Follow n like the post. And "pay' is credited soon. Thereafter he say THAT (Now there’s another job is to help the merchants increase their sales/traffic by complete orders , the orders may vary from 50 to 60 dollars per day, do you want to know more about it?) Which mean I will reg a acct in the platform and I will give him my invitation code and he will give me his. Meaning I will earn from THE 60 grab task in his account. And after tat I will complete another 60 task in my account then I will be after to draw out my commission. This goes on for 3 days. On the qst day WHEN I am doing task in my own account there is an order that went to negative figure. So I was being told that I need to TOP UP of (-$27) so I was thinking jus try out. N I contacted their CS (+65 8420 934?) they give me an account no. I was being told to top up within 10 to 15 mins else I need to get another account no from them. So after topping up transaction went smooth n cash out the commission plus top up amount. This went on for around 3 days (earning ard $80 to $100 per day) But as DAYS goes on the 4th day the top up KEEP increasing. They say I am lucky to have double or even package order. neg figures got higher from ($13x to $3100). And then he said that said all is by system generated. By the last neg I have already top up for more than $7k to $8k. And some amount was still borrowed from others. But tat was too late. They have been keeping to ask me top up after that. Saying I will be able to draw out if I top up the amt. Am frustrated wanted to earn extra income due to health issue n unable to work now and I have to pay for medical. But all my saving have been lost in this. I am at a lost now. I doubt I could get back the amount.
I saw a post on instagram about a job, so i click the link and was directed to diorlyn (9346486?). After explaining what the job is, she added me in the group 's 7 purchasing group', and there was a total of 21 people in the group. i was very wary at first, but after seeing how others in the group was earning. i decided to give a try, i was told to contact the customer service for task (93490108). i was given task, a link from shoppee was send to me and i have to take a screenshot of the item in my cart, and was given an bank account to transfer the money and few minutes after that my money was refunded plus commission. I thought it was legit so i did another task, and so my money was refunded too plus commission. Then suddenly, i was told that due to my fast response i was given the chance to join the VIP group with higher commission etc. It went downhill from there, my 3rd task onward, the was issues and i had to do more task to get my money back plus commission. it went on and on, and just went i was told that it was clear. my 'account' was frozen due to system error and i had to do a final task to unfroze my account. I was told to contact the manager, anthony woon(8441515?) who can help me. but nothing was done. I ended up losing a total of $23,079/-. I am always a very cautious and vigilant person, i dont know how i got lured into this. i am so mad at myself and very depressed because i lost of my savings during hari raya and i have bills and medical to settle end of the month. Please, don't be like me. all i can do now is hope and pray.

Then second day starts to tell sad story that he lost money, 230k pound due to a hospital he wants in jb that was not build as it was disrupted by covid. And his english had many spelling errors... With many rude words when i suspected him.He then insisted that he confirmed I was a a local by sending him my ID. So many scams. I told him to buzz off as he just comes online as and when he wants. Please be careful ladies.
I got a call from +65 8402 073? from a guy (sounds like Filipino accent) calling from Singtel. He said many people have been using my internet for illegal purposes and that he can try to help me check and remove these people from my internet. It sounded like a scam, so I immediately said I will get someone else to check and hang up the call. I called Singtel hotline to check, and the operator it was a scam and to share the encounter on this website.

Received a robocall from "MOH" threatening me with quarantine. I knew it was scam and hung up. Editor's Note: Please note that MOH will not use robocall to make unsolicited phone calls to members of the public.

I met the guy in facebook dating last 21-may. He introduced himself as philip chang, a 41 year old singaporean who grew up in houston texas. He’s an oil rig engineer and independent contractor with plans to settle down in singapore hence he’s looking for a partner. The persona he has created is someone who’s an introvert with little knowledge of the internet. Growing up as an asian in the us has turned him into a quiet loner due to the bullying. His dad died when he was a kid and grew up with his mom until she died of cancer 8 years ago. He has an uncle, a retired priest currently staying in a home. He only had 2 girlfriends in the past, 1st turned out to be a drug addict and the 2nd cheated on him with someone he knows. Since then he is married to his job.He was very patient, we chatted for almost 2 months in getting to know each other. Part of his daily routine is to do sermons, studying the bible by himself. He went to orphanages with his mom to donate. He shared a story of his worker stealing money from him through online banking which is why he doesn’t use online banking anymore. One day, he won a bidding contract in ukraine and had to fly there with his workers. His agent was waiting there with local workers. In ukraine, he shared the strict rules in safety measures in the rig like they can’t take pictures, videos or calls. He began sending love poems via email. Suddenly there were sea pirates who attacked their rig but no one was hurt. Our daily routine was chatting to find out if the other is ok. He’s able to fill my days with his messages. Then came my fear, their operation is now on-hold since their drilling machine has broken down beyond fixing. He has already used most of his funds in fixing it before. He has a deadline to meet and the only option is to buy a new machine worth us$ 178k. If he can’t finish the project, he’ll be sued for breach of contract. He asked if i could loan him money. I was in denial, that i should give people the benefit of the doubt. So i agreed to transfer sgd3000, an amount that i am prepared to lose. I told him that it’s the best i could offer to show my sincerity. So he asked me to transfer to his agent’s account in bangkok bank. He contacted me again saying he just needed a few more to buy the machine but this time i declined. I only found out about the scam and reported it right away.There are really heartless people who won’t feel any remorse in hurting people for their personal gain.
I received a robocall claiming the phone call was from MOH and to follow their instructions. Robocall message was first in English, followed by Mandarin. Asking me to give him my personal particulars. I hung up the phone IMMEDIATELY as this was a scam call.

Everything looks normal and until I find get scam and money was lost! I was trying to look for a part time job since I still want to concentrate on my study. I try to find the part time job from website and found the clickwork website. It have a whatapps to get you in touch with them. They tell me the job mission is call Affiliate marketing for Shopee to help new seller to push the sales for community. The tasks seems easy, follow the so called job assigned and add the designated goods to shopping cart, screenshot to them, transfer the money to the merchant provided by them and very soon they bank in back the money + commission in just a minutes and encourage you to do 5 tasks to get more rewards. The first 2 mission was done smoothly, funds was transfer back with commission in just a minutes. Until the 3rd mission the traps coming in, I have been in doubt, struggling and try to call those “participants” in the so call VIP group to verify whether it’s a scam. Look back the situation, seems the participants most properly is the team from the scam group. They show contacts in whatapps, they provide bank account. I was too good to believe if it is a scam they won’t show all these information. Now i find that even though report to police, I think it hard for the authority to charge them for scam as everything looks so normal and legal. The feeling of frustrated and angry just can’t help with it after my money not being refunded (it is my 3 months living costs). I have been thought I am a very caution and alert person, but seriously now i am thinking in deep and ask my god what happen and why it happen to me! I was sleepless the whole night, the feeling of pain and breathless from heart and body. The feeling of being cheated is so bad! No matter how, the following action still need after calm down: 1. Report to police. 2. Talk to family or friend. (family member please do not scold, the victim already feel so bad and the Scam group is so smart and professional)。 3. I am still trying to deep introspect myself how could it happen to me. No free lunch in this world) Exactly same as per below news: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-warn-of-a-new-trend-in-online-scams-nsf-loses-over-6700-in-savings “小心从网站调用 clickwork.online 的诈骗电话 Shopee 联盟营销！ 一切看起来都很正常，直到我发现骗局和钱都消失了，所以只结束一个词”shit!” 我想找一份兼职工作，因为我仍然想专注于我的学习。我试着从网站上找到兼职工作，然后找到了clickwork网站。它有一个whatapps可以让你与他们取得联系。 他们告诉我的工作任务是为Shopee呼叫联盟营销，帮助新卖家推动社区销售。任务看起来很简单，按照所谓的工作分配并将指定的商品添加到购物车，screeshot给他们，把钱转给他们提供的商人，很快他们就在一分钟内把钱+佣金存起来，并鼓励你做5个任务来获得更多的奖励。前2个任务顺利完成,錢也很快進帳口，直到第3个任务陷阱进来了，我一直在有疑问，挣扎着尝试打电话给 VIP组中的那些“會員”，以验证它是否是一个骗局。回头看情况，似乎参与者是诈骗集团的团队。 他们在whatapps中显示联系方式，他们提供银行帐户。我太好了，不敢相信如果这是一个骗局，他们不会显示这一点。即使向警方报案，我认为当局很难以诈骗罪起诉他们，因为一切看起来都很正常和合法。 在我的钱没有被拿走后，沮丧和愤怒的感觉无法帮助它退款（这是我 3 个月的生活费）。我一直认为我是一个非常谨慎和警觉的人，但现在我认真地思考并问我的上帝发生了什么以及为什么会发生在我身上！ 我一夜没睡，被骗的感觉太糟糕了！無論如何，冷静下来还是需要做以下的动作： 1。报警。 2。与家人或朋友交谈。 （请家属不要骂人，受害者已经感覺很糟糕了，骗子团这么聪明和专业）。 3.我仍在努力深入反省自己，这怎么可能发生在我身上。（世界上没有免费的午餐） https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-warn-of-a-new-trend-in-online-scams-nsf-loses-over-6700-in-savings

He added that there were numerous connection locally and internationally contacted to my home internet. To resolve this issues, he transferred me to another person from the line which claimed from the it support dept. He then asked me to open my laptop and follow his instruction. Firstly, i was told to press the window key and the 'r' keys at the same times, which pop up the control bar.. I was then was instructed to key in "cmd" in the control bar which turned the screen blank with some data reading (like a kind of it programmer do). He then asked to key in "assoc" at the last data and key enter.. Then again the screen shown some kind of data. From that point of time, i started to doubt and questioned him to verify himself. He didn’t answer but insisted that I follow through with the process. During the conversation, I had my husband on the other phone and told me to stop and ignore the caller, since my conversation was on loud speaker, the caller ended the call.

She informed that she is going to cancel my healthcare benefits, insurance policy, healthcare subsidies because I have imported an illegal covid drug from China (Beijing) from Singapore. Not believing her, I told her I would need to verify her identity before addressing the issues.
Immediately after the call was picked up, scammer identified me by my full name. It sounded legit. Scammer was speaking in mandarin, but accent not very strong like a typical mainland Chinese. Sounded more like a local. He tried to be casual, pretended to be a friend, saying that he lost his phone hence changed his phone number. He said we know each other. I kept asking his name and he evaded, but repeating the fact that we know each other. After he evaded my question for his identity the third time, i put down the phone. The second time this happened was 2 days after. The scammer identified me by my full name. I answered in English. He asked me to speak in chinese. I asked him again for the second time in English.

matched with this guy in cmb dating app. there are so many red flags, writing this to create awareness. 1. he's not in sg, he's in shanghai. 1st red flag, as someone keen on dating should be in same location as you, in order to meet up. his reason was he always comes to sg for business &amp; thinking of settling down &amp; get a pr. he will visit sg in sep. 2. he asked for whatsapp, the number used to whatsapp is malaysia country code +60 he said this number he used when he went for business trip to malaysia, i asked him when was his last visit to malaysia, he said 2 yrs ago. WHILE I READ ONLINE WHATSAPP IS BANNED IN CHINA UNLESS YOU USE VPN. so i asked if he used vpn, his answer was no i used mobile data, when my data finished i will use vpn. i really want to laugh, this guy did not understand what he was saying. this whole conversation with him is another red flag. 3. he shared about trading gold using metatrader 4 (mt4). asked me to download &amp; open demo account. i'm actually a trader myself &amp; used mt4 for forex trading, but i pretend &amp; play along with him. the broker he's using is glluck, you can find the name in mt4 &amp; website of the company (based in us), everything looks legit. only that when i googled for review of glluck, there was a post saying this company not regulated &amp; warn to stay away. he said he has "teacher" who know very well the timing to trade, once the teacher tells him when to trade he will share with me so we can trade at same time. he texted me to trade that night, but i didn't reply his message, so he was trying to call me twice, i didn't answer. after that he showed me screen shot of his trading profit 35,100 usd. to trade with this profit, you need to have a least usd100k capital. if he could make this much in one night, he won't be sharing with a stranger whom he never met. after that night i didn't continue to chat with him because i knew from the beginning this guy is a scam. i just wanted to know what's the scam tactic since this type of scam was not heard before in sg. i did a google search, it's very common in china and hkg, they use mt4 so it looks legit, they will then manipulate the broker system (or create fake broker), they will make you create live account after trying demo account, let you earn money from trading, but later the more you put in, you won't be able to get the money back.
I received the call at 4.13pm today. and i knew something was amiss when the caller on the other end spoke to me in chinese and identify himself as a staff from DBS bank. he claimed that I have outstanding balance that i owe them on a credit card ending with 8700, and i replied him pls call the police if i owe them money. he asked why, i said it's because i do not have any dbs credit card ending in that number. he persisted to say that i applied for the card mid last month, and there is outstanding balance of 1k++ on it, and I have to pay up. i said then do call the police. he then hung up. points that make me suspicious: 1. dbs never call me and speak to me in chinese. and in an accent that isn't singaporean. 2. i have only one credit card with dbs, and i know the card number. 3. i have not applied for a new credit card in years 4. they called me on my mobile no that is no longer registered with DBS
The scammer told me that i delivered a package of medicine for covid-19 from china to Singapore without informing the custom. as punishment, my insurance will be terminated. to solve this, I will need to go to MOH before 15:00 (I received the call at 13:00).

I was trying to find a loan of $10,000 and therefore, i would search on the internet to look out for some licensed money lenders. On 1 night, i decided to find a website and fill up my particulars such as my name, phone number and email address as i thought that the loan website was rather interesting in giving out its interest rates. On the following day, i was contacted by a whatsapp number and this number represents its company, "lending bee pte ltd". I chatted with this number and they sound like they are a legitimate business. Eventually we came to an agreement that i have to pay an upfront of $2,000 for admin &amp; stamp charges which i've paid too before the approval of my loan as the loan officer said that my $2,000 would be refundable at the end of my loan. However, after paying of the $2,000, they demanded another $1,300 to activate my case and to access their banking accounts. I found it suspicious as there is a hidden fee which I did not sign in the imposter contract. I therefore knew that it was a scam and decided to call my bank to tell them about the problems that I've faced and made a police report immediately. I now knew that singapore licensed money lenders are not allowed to advertise their services online and that it will always be safer to acquire a loan at their actual office instead of doing it online. I did not know that this was a scam as this is my 1st time trying to acquire a loan.Editor's Note: Please note that unlicensed moneylenders can impersonate as licensed moneylenders by creating fake websites using their details.

I received an SMS offering home-based jobs from Zalora. Looked fake!Editor's Note: Beware of fake job adverts. Scammers are using legitimate companies' details including their UEN numbers which can be found online such as their websites, ACRA, etc, to trick people into responding to their ads. Please get in touch with the companies directly via their official websites and contact details to verify the legitimacy of the ads. If you come across such dubious adverts on social media, always remember to report the advertiser to the platform that you saw the ad.
I saw a FB post advertising a job vacancy. The advert showed a local company and even used a UEN number. However, the numbers shown in the ad were foreign numbers although it's a Singapore company. Thinking that it was legitimate, I contacted the advertiser via one of the numbers shown. The conversation got really weird and I was asked to do some home-based work that requires me to complete some tasks for me to get a commission. After getting in touch with the actual company through their official number found online, I realised that they have been impersonated and they have not put out any job adverts online. It's a relief that I noticed that something was wrong during the conversation as I remembered seeing some job scam alerts online. Editor's Note: Beware of fake job adverts.

Happened 2 days ago. It starts with a job offer where you like follow and comment on tiktok videos for $3. Then subsequently they introduce the website www.easiearn.top to users. Users have to top up cash into the 'account' created to grab 60 'orders' daily. This is called 'reloading'. Once reloaded, users can continue to grab orders until 60 orders have been completed. However they only allowed users to withdraw $100 a day. I transferred $250, but could only withdraw $100 at the end of the day. The remaining $150 is used for next day orders. However, it is not enough and i will have to reload again. Which means i will have to input more money into the system. Since i can only withdraw $100 a day, it will mean that i cannot fully withdraw everything subsequently. The amount just gets bigger and bigger, and i will not get money back. Person who hired me has contact number 8167 154?, website 'customer service' number is 8203181?.
Got matched on CMB app. Said to be an engineer working for exxon mobile in malaysia on a project but lots of delay due to MCO, based in Penang now for a project. 40yo single, from houston texas, malaysia project ending in 8 months' time. Working off oil rig 6 days a week. Nothing was lost but because i cut him off quicker by asking him for his full name and he stop the chat because he realised that i was googling him and left the conversation in cmb but i reported him. One of his long messages about his job: after 8 months i will see but my project here is much more complicated. I am project manager that work for and with national oilwell varco nov, i can get individual project from corporation but not countries. Here in malaysia i am an independent subcontractor for exxon using nov certificate. As an in-depended contractor my contract will be an out sources contract. I am in-charge of it, including the funding..although i go get paid for the project in 3 stages. During the start i will get 25% fund of the project then after 2nd inspection which will be in the middle of the project i will get 50% funding and at the end of the project then i will get final 25% complete so mostly i run on my capital .. All the expenses but at end of the project my payment is 35% of the project cost thou after paying tax and dividend to nov i will be left with 25% but for off shore project that i will work nov, not as a contract i just get paid for my services .. So it’s a bit complicated. But just little into what brought me here to malaysia, so after this i could take time off to take a rest or maybe taken on another project.
Received text message that my bank acct has been suspended and to call a number to get it cleared.
1) the person will befriend you and pretend to be interested in your life etc. this would probably result in daily/nightly calls to check on you 2) once they perceived to have gotten your trust, they will ask you to help them with an errand which is to do some online betting on this website zaws.xyz/#/ (Note: Fake website do not click), to show you how much you can earn, the excuse they have given is that they have discovered a loophole in the system. The website looks like the image attached. 3) they will pressure you to sign up for an account, probably to entice you with earlier wins and then block the rest of your earnings behind a hefty paywall do not fall for this scam, the website ending with .XYZ is an obvious fake, the company 东方金控 does not exist.
Received a call from someone claiming to be from MOH and saying that I have yet to collect important documents.
I applied for a Personal Assistant job on indeed.com, however the way the person replied me was highly dubious, promising $900/mth, saying that they were a frontline nurse for Indian Citizens, while also doing business with a kids apparel store in Orchard Rd called Lagomkids (a quick google search shows otherwise). I was suspicious so they sent me their ic to prove they were "authentic", and after we mutually ghosted each other for a few days, they contacted me again and told me they needed me to help them with a KYC, and told me they will provide the login details for an app called coinhako. Without any contract or interviews for the role. it sounded really fishy at this point so I've left them on read. I've sent an email to the genuine LagomKids who said they did not post such a job on jobsites, and are not looking for anyone. Beware of her!
1) A guy who claims himself as a moh officer told me that a phone number under my name has sent a lot of spam messages during the covid period and I'll get sued soon, all the way in standard chinese with a bit faked voice in a rather serious tone which could easily bring people stress. I asked him to prove his authenticity by telling my IC number, and he dodged with some excuse. Then I ask him to speak in English and he seemed to not understand what I'd said and still talked all the way in chinese. 2) june 25th, 2021 3) nothing lost.
Receive a call from +65 66028227, claimed that he is a financial administrator from mwa capital. I need to take up a loan of $9000, and he said that I need to pay $1800 for bond payment before I can get the loan. I have no money at that period of time. So I ask him to put a hold on. he said he needs my ic, my payslip, cpf, contract, and credit report, so I gave everything to him. a few days later, I felt something is wrong, and I went to the actual mwa capital and is a different number. Hence I gave a call. They said that the number is not what I stated, so I WhatsApp him back and told him I might be spammed to cancel all the applications. But there is no reply, I called the number, and no one picks up the call. After several calls, he started to threaten me and say out loud my house address by telling me that if I called him again, he would come down and burn my house. I felt threaten and called the police. They already sent some officers to patrol my house area, and I went to make a police report. I feel so worried and having a sleepless night. 2) calls happen on 19 June, threaten to happen on 23 June 3) no transactions are made

Caller claims that he is from Singtel security department and informed that my internet was used by many unauthorised people who use it for illegal transaction. by the way, i am not a singtel user. caller insisted that singtel supports all the internet at the backend. he wanted to guide me to remove these users from my internet. the caller instructed me to key "win" R , then CMD and assoc ( follow by enter). that generates a list of file associations.

Got to know this guy called devin in cmb, who claims to be doing furniture trading biz in spore and staying in sentosa. He asked to chat in whatsapp in his my line and i realised soon after he deleted his cmb acc. After chatting for some weeks, he brought up abt him making good money on bitcoin investment and asked me to tag on his to try out with min $500 as deposit. I was already looking for new investment myself and i thought why not. He gave me a dodgy link https://m.ele9988.com (Impt: Do not click on this link) and asked me to register. He guided me how to do it and advised which bitcoin to invest. The platform looks legit with live trading prices. The customer service will give a local account dbs or uob# for em to transfer. After i provide the screenshot, the usdt will appear in my account. I deposited $2000 the 2nd time and i made ard $200 so i opt to withdraw to test water and within hrs my money is back to my bank ac from some random dbs acc which i now believe is a money mule or online job fraud where victims are asked to make money transfer for rebates. So with my capital and profit back, i thought this is legit. He persuaded me to invest more as he had good judgement on some bitcoins. So i went on with $5k and again i got ard $900 profit. I didnt withdraw immediately as i hv intention of investing more. He was very persistent that i pump in another 10k which raised a red flag to me. We were supposed to meet on 13jun but cancelled when i refused to invest more. At this point, i realised that i cld be scammed. I tried to withdraw my $ but the customer service told me withdrawal system under maintenance and asked me to check after a few days. I never got my money back until now and that site and devin have both vanished. Please do not trust anyone online, do your due diligence when it comes to investment. This will be a hard lesson learnt for me.

it had been a while since it is happened on 28.05.2021 but i am sharing the stories now. I received the Whatsapp about the job offer for affiliate marketing. out of the curiosity, I had click the link and ask for the it. the scammer had directed me to a group chat which around 15 people.. in the group chat, there is a lot of scammers doing the task and forward the bank remittance receipts/ evidence after the task done. furthermore, they directed me to ask in person for the job offer. the jobs actually required us to click to the link provided, add to the cart, screenshot and transfer to the selected bank account that given by them. IN the return, they will transfer back the amount to us together with 10% rebate. for tc he first 3 job that i done, they did return my principal together with the 10% rebate. after i done 3 jobs, they ask me to join another vip group chat and claimed that the jobs done will be 20% rebate. From the 4th job that I've carried out, they planned not to return my money. They claimed that the system has frozen my account hence i need to carry out 5th job to unfreeze it. after I've done 5th job, they did not return my money and yet i keep asking to return my money without rebate as i just want to get back my money that transferred. they claimed that my account has been unfreeze but i need to carry out 6th job in order to get back the money. i had no choice but just to do it. so i carry 7th job and they claimed it is ACCELERATED job which all the vip member had to do it. i had carry it without any doubt and they keep give me reason to carry another job until i had transferred out all my money to them. they even asked me to borrow from relative and friend to carry out the job as i told them that i had no more money and i had kids to feed. they keep insulted me and ask me to transferred. i know i had been scammed after my hubby sent me the related stories about this but it is too late. it is my nightmare in one day and i even lost all my savings all these year. i had lost about SGD72,000 due to the greed. i am regret everyday and hopefully the police can catch the scammers so that i can recover some of the money lost. hopefully there is no more victims after i shared the stories. the online platform they using is shopee, now they turned to lazada.

He was shocked and hurriedly hung up the call. there were no loss to this scam from me, except 3 minutes of my life that came just when I needed to vent my frustration at work.
Was contaCted by ray via whatsapp regarding a loan offer. As i was in urgent need of money i started to enquire more and sent my Payslip, Identification details as well as my bank account number. Was told that my loan for $3000 was approved but his compAny had to do a test loan first. He immediateLy sent me a screenshot oF a transfer of $500 to my account and told me that i had to repay $650 within a week For the test loan. After 1 week i kepT asking for the account number for repaYment but ray Told me to pay $150 first for deferment even though i did not ask for any deferment to the test loan. A few days later, he gave me another account number and told me that the repayment amount was $650 even though i had already paid $150 before. He mentioned that the initial $150 would be “refunded” to me along with the $3000 loan. That’s when i figured that i had been scammed. Not wanting to deal with any harassment, I transferred the $650 to that account number and told ray to cancel my initial loan application. I then made a police report. The worst part was that not long later my bank account was frozen by my bank as The initial $500 sent to my account was from someone who had been scammed too. I had To wait almost 2 years for my bank account to be unfrozen by the bank due to the long Investigation process. So much inconvenience all to (but) no thanks to the scammer!
On 6 june 2021, we got Matched on ok cupid online dating platform. Very fast, we went onto whats app to continue chatting. He packaged himself as a hong kong mixed with korea borned orthopedic surgeon who worked for the American red cross association in new york. But presently in korea visiting his mum. Once he is done with his last contract with red cross,he will come to relocate to singapore to set up a clinic. He has an apartment in marina bay. Every day, we will exchange messages but he seemed to be very busy. It took few hours for every message to be replied. I never think much why he is using a whats app business account. For 7 days, he appeared to be very sweet to me, calling me his dear/baby/queen etc. He will send me photos of him doing surgery and giving lecture. His english in our messages were so good and properly written. I had experience online dating before, even with foreigners. Usually they will want to chat or video call with us once they like our conversation. So i am curious, i started requesting for virtual date with Dr david. He evaded my requests twice. On my 8th day with him, my friend sent me a link to read about all the scam stories here. I decided that, i must chat or see him on video. Since day by day i got emotional attached to his messages. He tried to run away from my requests as usual. But finally he tried making me happy by saying to call me by the end of the day. I was prepared that he will find excuses in not calling me eventually. But he did and i was in total shockness. He sounded like an Nigerian to me and he quickly explained that he been alot of missions and his accent just change. Quickly, i ended the call in 15mins. Then i told my friend who decided to use all the pictures he gave me to do an image search in korea website. To our astonishment, we found out that the pictures are all taken from an instagram of a korean cosmetic surgeon. By now, i know that i am in a scam. I asap report and block his whatsapp.

From time to time all these people inside the chatroom posted their respective payments to lazada as their proof of payment earning the same commission, however i started to realized all of them are not genuine and most likely all of their msg were not real which is only to mislead me. I lost $900+ due to greed but what was baffling is that the vacancy post came from official lazada sms line which i usually received official text such as otp from lazada. Hope lazada can explain about this.

I received a text message (Whatsaap) from a number (+91 90988 70963) from India. His name is ives. Probably his name is fake. But his profile picture consists of a young indian girl with a birthmark on her left cheek and and her forehead (left temple), and black spot on the area between her eyebrows and eyes. The message wrote like this: "Hi there, do you need part-time job? Monthly salary 8000-30000, sgd 500 per day at least. No service charge. Easy job, can do at home. If you are interested in this job, please contact whatsa[[: https://wa.me/6581671395/" Of course, i didn't believe and didn't do anything. I thought i could share the details here to warn others about this scam.
I would like to share scams that are happening on social media and dating platforms. I would like to share certain details which might be good knowledge for the public on what to look out for and the telltale signs. This is a potential Love and Cryptocurrency Scam situation. First telltale sign: Display pictures of matches are usually very attractive females/males. However, such pictures are often reused. So there are two things which are easy to spot. 1) Pictures are usually low quality and low in resolution and grainy looking. 2) There is a function in Google which you can do "Google image search". https://images.google.com/ Users can screenshot the profile picture and upload using the link to do an image search. Should the image be reused a couple of times, it will show up in the search with multiple results. (An almost immediate sign that the account is a scam account) Second telltale sign : She had a phone number which was a nonlocal number (+852) 1) While this may not be a straightforward sign.. this should raise some alarm. Third telltale sign : Weird looking URL: Below is the URL sent by Aditi : https://d.app66372.xyz/?id=782ce5254eba50d0fc21c498c0975b8c 1) URL ends with xyz which are usually nonlegitimate platforms for trading. Official trading platforms should also come with .com or .sg 2) Should one open the link, images are seen to be in low resolution and low quality. 3) The text on the website is often reused. After doing a simple google with the first text in the URL "140万单/秒的核心撮合技术首家建立投资者保护基金-SAFU基金" Google images immediately return multiple instances of the same text. Below are two links that google returned, which had a direct replica of the link Aditi gave. https://d.wbgtd.buzz/?id=d24609dfd72fa52a70d05b2bbc1e7b85 https://d.wbgtd.buzz/index_zh-TW?id=d24609dfd72fa52a70d05b2bbc1e7b85 Of course, by this time - I return the two links above Aditi blocked me instantly. Forth telltale sign : Aditi was extremely persuasive in trying to get me to "earn as much as her", getting her uncle and sister to "teach me". The full phone number in the case is +852 9084 8107 Also note: Aditi was able to say where she lived in Singapore. In this case, she said Serangoon and named "Forest Woods" as her place of residence.
Approached by this number 8415511?, via whatsapp stating that i had been requesting and applying loans from their company website via fb. i replied stating that i do not need any loans, he started to text voice messages me, telling me that he will track me down etc. malaysian accent. beware.
It happens on 5/6/2021 at 6:52pm when i receive a sms saying that they are hiring people to work from home and the daily income is 300 or above. Then there is a whatsapp link which bring me to a whatsapp number of 83658150. The name stated on the whatsapp number is 'shopee frontline service'. I asked for more detail from him and get to know that they are so called the affiliate marketing team of shopee. He then asked me for my name, age, gender and phone number. I gave him all the information that he wanted. After that, he sent me another contact number (82032193) which he said is 'customer service' and the 'customer service' will teach me how to start my job and earn commissions. I messaged the so called customer service and he asked for my personal information such as full name per ic, age, occupation and bank account number (salary purpose). I gave him all the information and got the first task. So basically the task was he sent a link of a shopee product, and i need to add the product to my shopping cart then screenshot the cart for him. After that i need to pay the exact amount of the product to a bank account that he sent it to me. The bank account number is 3963938312, the name he gave me was 'elfy', which i felt it was a scam because normally people will provide full name or at least a western name with a surname. I stop messaging him the moment i felt fishy about the job. Luckily i did not transfer the money to him but my personal details are with him, so i still feel unsafe about it.
Today 1254hrs (5-June 2021) i received a sms named Lazada-6.6 with the details as below: Lazada has offered vacancy to work at home Flexible working hours work from home due to Covid-19 daily income of 150-350SGD+15% https://wapp.my/+6581856376) Once connected to this whatsapp chat (Lazada Vacancy +65-81856376) explained to me how can i earned 15% commission by helping small e-commerce merchants to boost their sales and ratings.

Once i have started this Job at around 1830hrs today, they add me into another whatsapp chatroom with total 12 person inside all with Singapore mobile numbers and with pictures. From time to time all these people inside the chatroom posted their respective payments to Lazada as their proof of payment earning the same commission, however i started to realized all of them are not genuine and most likely all of their msg were not real which is only to mislead me. Due to my personal anger at the final stage, i have deleted both the Customer Service and Chatroom whatsapp msg therefore i have no proof to submit. Total lost from my payment to this scam is SGD 968.65 Prior to this i have earned from them (as a bait) SGD 22.35
I have received a scam/impersonation SMS from "DBS BANK" on 3.06pm, 5 June 2021. The sender name was in all capital letters, and looked very much like the bank. Except that it had signed off with a personal phone number and its contents are regarding loans. I referred to my previous SMS OTPs coming from the actual bank, are realized the real Bank sender is under the name "DBS Bank". (captial "B", with Small caps for "ank")
Beware of the credit-for-sex scams using gift cards as a form of payment for sex. What they will do is ask you to purchase an itunes gift card at a nearby convience store before meeting, after purchase the potential scammer wanted me to reveal the itunes gift card redemption code before meeting me. Decline that offer and move to another person from a trusted source (keep the gift card to yourself if you have purchased). Lessons to be learned: do not use gift cards as a payment for sex services, only accept cash on hand or meet up first before you make any online transactions between both parties. I hope my experience brings up some alert to the community, do stay safe everyone...
I Was trying out the Facebook dating feature and spoke to two different Chinese man. First red flag was they promptly asked to move to other apps for communication. Please take note as they are using this period whereby people can't meet to gain trust and manipulate you. they suddenly call me sweetheart out of nowhere and acted like they care about my daily life. Sometimes they will voice call and send pictures while demanding yours (Never give your Photos). Two different tricks used WERE: 1. Ask you to help with downloading an app to play a GAME because their sibling can't use it 2. Ask you to download an app to make a quick income. Very easy in 20 Mins. For the first one, you see the immediate rewards and will feel tempted to do it yourself. You just need to create an account with your email. To transfer money, you need to upload your ID. I did it and regretted because of possible identity theft. They Will need you to transfer money to an Account belonging to someone. Which is very suspicious. For the second one, the moment I refused to credit money into the Account, that person immediately blew up and acted like I was in the wrong. The explanation for the app was a money investment game. But it was in fact a fraudulent get rich quick scam, hoping that you throw in a big sum of money into a suspicious account. They are preying on vulnerable women and they are very good at making it sound like they care about you. Beware ladies. These man are professionals.
I met this girl online on facebook and she added me thru whatsapp. At first, we casual chatted only. She was wanting to chat with me everyday and complimenting me. Thereafter, she told me to download an app which looked like a legit investment app that is produced by orient securities trading, a mas regulated brokerage firm. at first, she told me to log into her account and showed me how easy was it to invest and get profits. She told me to set up an account. Then she told me to put in $100 to try, and on the first night, i earned $20 profits. I was able to cash out my earnings to my bank account. When i had to top up the credits, i had to transfer to a 3rd party bank account, and when i received the money, it was thru a 3rd party bank account as well. On subsequent nights, she asked me to top up $1,000 and $5,200. As i earned some money the previous night, i was confident of earning more this time round and transferred those money accordingly. i also earned more profits, which led me to think that this investment app is legit. So on the 4th night, she asked me to top up $20,000 and participate in a vip activity. So i did what she told me to do and i participated in the vip activity and topped up $20,000. Little did i know that once i "participated", i was not able to withdraw any of my money and that i had to top up my account to $100,000 in order to be able to withdraw my money. Feeling desperate, i went to transfer funds from my other bank accounts to try and hit the $100,000 target, and at the same time, she also said she will help me by transferring $20,000 into the app account to reach the $100,000 goal. I even had to use credit card cash advance, and incurred 8% interest charge. When i finally reached $100,000 goal, i tried to withdraw the money, but the app said i had to bet a few more times before i can withdraw. So i went to bet and when i tried to withdraw, the app said my account has been frozen. The app now said that in order for me to unfreeze my account, i will have to top up another $65k+ more to withdraw everything. I got very upset and desperate, and confided in my parents and wife that they told me that it was an obvious scam. In order to top up the $65k, the girl even offered to top up another $10k more to help me reach that goal. The original orient securities holdings brokerage firm contacted me later on to verify that their company does not have such an app and the one that i was using is a gambling app and is not regulated. In total, i lost about $80k to this scam
THere is a whatsapp message about earning money by part time The term that they like to use is affiliate marketing. they claim to THEY CLAIM TO WORK UNDER LAZADA THIRD PARTIES. 1) order the goods in lazada , snap shot to them 2) wire money to a local dbs bank account and they will refund you with the commission 3) submit the snap shot and complete the task 4) they claim to complete 3 tasks to earn $38, 5/6 tasks for $ 68 and blah blah blah it will be 1 local line to contact you for the bank acc number ,phone number and full name to so called register you in. the profile is a chinese with suit on, look profressional like those real estate agent with good english. he will guide us thru the intro. so they will create a chat group "exchange group" with the lazada logo, however if you take note, there is quite a few group they have. at first , i will doubt the job then you will see the members inside the group would start to start a conversation within the group and showcase the job completed. I was doubltful then i just quit. next day, they will ask if you want to join back, most likely is another group. that is how i know there are numerous group. here the funny part, if you see carefully , almost 90% of the members will be the same number and profile picture. and in the different group , you will see those member acting noob and ask those question like : "DOes this able to make money?" , "what do you mean by claim rewards? ", "ok , i will give it a try if i have time" etc etc. when you realise they are completing task on the previous group. another giveaway will be the numbers inside the whatsapp group, when you speak to them , they will not reply you with using voice voice and their answer is pretty standard. the best part is their english is so frequent english that there is no any singlish ,spelling mistake or broken english which was common in our region.
A lady with a strong Indian ascent claimed that she is a Singtel technician. she called and ask about the no of lights blinking on the router. then she will say that they notice that there is high data usage of up to 70% which is abnormal. she will then ask you how many devices are using the router. Then she would scare you by saying that they notice 20 over devices connected and that's where I told her that its impossible as my wireless network is password protect. she keep trying to dig further which I told her off to drop me a email and I say i'm not going to explain anymore on the phone where she just hang up during the argument. by the way, the SingTel internet account was signed up by my wife and my account was mobile only. so there is no way that they will call me on internet issues.
Got to know 2 potential scammers via okc/cmb: 1) Lin yang (via okc around mar 2021) - first big red flag was asking to converse in chinese. then he said he was in sg for his business and his uncle taught him how to do some investment and he wanted to teach me how. i said i wasnt interested as i was doing my own investments but he insisted and said that just 1k would be enough to try sth new. he also sent over flowers and cake despite us not having met before. the 2nd time he tried to persuade me to join but i didnt want to and then he ghosted me after that. 2) shiweize (via cmb May 2021) - did not talk to him much as it was a big red flag when he asked to converse in chinese as he grew up in china though he is a local. i said no i cant do chinese and so he continued to talk in english but when i asked him more specific questions about his ns, he couldnt answer and didnt reply after that.
Almost lost money to a scammer. This girl added me in line asking which part of sg i am in, i replied in Yishun . She then said she is also from yishun and then proceeded to offer me her sex services. She told me to meet up at Yishun, once there she told me take picture of the surroundings. I took it and sent to her. Then she said she is on the way and asked me for my hp no which i gave, then she said a guy will call me and i just needed to say i am not police can already. The guy called me, this was when my phone app highlighted in red with indonesia no +62000000001 with over 500 reports of scam, i picked up the call knowingly it is likely to end in scam. The guy i didn't catch the name, asked me if i am the first time using the service, i said yes. Then he told me because its 1st time, i will need to go axs machine to purchase not sure what credit, when the purchase is made and receipt printed, i will pass it to the girl upon meeting up . At this point i hesitated and but still joined the queue at the axs machine. I backed out and told the guy machine is spoilt. Then he asked me to go 7 eleven to buy a google play store gift card , which i refused cause i know at this point, it is definitely a scam. His tone started to have the threatening effect. He stressed that the sexual services are backed by gang call 369. And he also said he has my hp no which he is able to check my particulars. And that now even if i do not want service i still need to buy the gift card and pass it to the girl. I refused and continue making my way home. Blocked all nos and deleted line account. Nothing was lost except my hp no.
The caller was trying to impersonate an official from high court of singapore. He was speaking in heavily accented Mandarin and vehemently defending that he was from the chinese department of the high court. as an ex-civil servant, i knew straight off it was a scam call and questioned him on his identity, making him more irritable before calling him a scammer and cutting the line.
This kind of scams are quite new to me, and mostly to many others too. recently i shared my address info to a carousell seller so she could send out the items i ordered to me. today though, i received a message from someone named championcou. the message went like this. Your parcel IMS00925X18 has been scheduled for delivery to xx xx DR #xx-x Sxxxxxx by 2021-06-01. ~Champion Courier *inserts link* they ended off the text stating that the message was from champion courier. confused as i dont remember getting anything mailed by champion courier, i asked my seller about it. she said that she sent out my item by singpost. i trust her becuase ive done multiple transactions to and from with her and so far there werent any issues. thinking the message could be a scam, i searched about these type of scams and what they do to you but i ended up with only a few articles on it. they claim that these scams will insert viruses into your mobile devices once you click on the tracking link. however, that didnt scare me that much. what scares me the most is that people had access to my address and my contact number. furthermore, i had just moved here recently. i only remember revealing my address on whatsapp and that's about it. i am quite sure that there are some hackers out there that are able to get information from your text messages. so, do be careful when revealing your personal information online. even though i have not lost any money (yet) i still feel that the public needs to know about it as these scams may lead to many other unfavourable circumstances to vulnerable people Note: how i confirmed the message was fake was that i went to the offical champion courier website and searched for 'my' parcel with the tracking number provided to me but the website was unable to find an actual parcel registered under that number. also, i watched the tracking from the link provided. it showed me that the courier driver circled round the neighbourhood near me but it never stopped at my estate.
got a call from this number +65 8550 1716, june 01, 2021. the guys is posing as customer service of singtel and making me believe that there is a problem and immediate concern on my internet (which i find strange since we are in our household not experiencing anything as such), already got an idea that he's into something fishy so cut him off and drop the call. nothing was lost but worth a share to others they intend to scam.
It happened after she sent me a a facebook msg,and added me on whatapps ke ke,asked me to wait at choa chu kang mrt axs top up mycard credit and he threatened to hurt me and my family so i added protection fee.the amount keep go up and i stop 1600. He sent picture of people injured and to cheat me.
Received a call and it SOUNDS like an AUTOMATED machine. Notified me to bring the relevant documents and go to a location for quarantine. Prompted me to press '3' for inquiries but I did not do so. When i didn't press anything, it hung up on me. I tried calling again but line was busy.
I was contacted by an overseas number about a part time job for a “LIKE” Assistant, Merchandise Sales Agents. I proceeded to contact the "agent" which claims to be adding me as her downline so that both are able to earn commission together. After downloading the app "lazada rebate" to conduct the job. which was simple and quick to complete the tasks and the required number of orders (60) to be able to withdraw the commission. i also had to do a reload when there were consecutive orders and in order to clear them, i had to directly transfer money to an individual account provided by the plateform. things started getting fishy and realised I could be getting scammed when the reload amount started getting higher. as i was not able to keep up with the amount to transfer, the last order being about $23,000. i stopped and i tried to get my money out but the platform kept telling me to complete the 60 orders before i could withdraw all the funds which i have reloaded (which had amount to about $26000). i tried contacting the app customer service but was given the same answer to complete 60 orders before i could withdraw. also, the number of orders will reset to zero each new day. hence, another 60 orders will have to be completed. which will require more money to be transferred to them to clear the consecutive orders. i believe i have been a victim of a highly elaborated scam.
First messaged by +507 6240-7753 on whatsapp about part-time job opportunity involving "grabbing orders" on lazada.Then redirected to 'serene', phone number 81667024.Then told to install an apkQuote: 'it is to help the merchant to make orders in lazada rebate. I will give you the download link. You can download it now. After registered, you will need to send me your invitation code. I will use your invitation code to register an account as your downline, then i will give you the account and you can help me to grab the order, after grabbing 60 orders, your account will get 12% commissionThis is the invitation code that you will need to fill in when registration : 756128
I received a call from +65-8559-752? claiming to be MOH and regarding covid-19 child isolation press 3.I knew it was a scam since similar calls used to come claiming to be dbs bank. I am reporting this to safeguard others from such scams.
It's a female voice. Sounds like a Chinese national with a strong Chinese accent. Claimed to be calling from the authorities. To notify me that this is the final notification of my quarantine order and ask that i get prepared. Should i have any queries, please press '3'
I keep getting calls from various numbers. a recorded message first claims that they're from DBS in English. Then it goes on to say hold the line, and then something in chinese which i don't understand. I believe they then connect me to an operator however i always cut the call the moment i recognise this pattern. I'm sharing this encounter now so that no one else is harmed.
Been receiving recorded fake calls from DBS bank saying they have been trying to reach me about an issue with my account and they sounded like i need to take an action. The calls are from these numbers +658255051?, +659656974?, +659901480?. In the new regulations, all overseas calls will come with the plus sign prefix. If it is a local call, no prefix should be included and these number have the prefix +65.
1. received a call on 24 May 2021, at 1:55PM from this number and it was a recorded message stating that i did not respond or reply to dbs despite repeated attempts. I was then asked to press '3' to continue the call. I hung up as it did not make sense reaching out to me on my office mobile number as i had not provided this to dbs. so, this is definitely a phishing scam as the action to press '3' is to ascertain that they are reaching out to a human and hence any response would mean being 'baited' by them. nothing was lost except for time but thought it should be made aware to the public if they receive similar calls.
I received a call from +65 8745574? today. It claimed from MOH and relates to quarantine asking me to report to MOH HQ by 2hrs later...I asked why I need to quarantine? He Claimed that I visited TTSH! I did not visit TTSH more than a year ago. After that I call to MOH to inquire. MOH commented that it was a scam call. And reported to SPF. Don't be fooled by scammers, everyone!
1) received a call from +65 number today. It was a robocall claiming to be from MOH and relates to vaccination. Upon selecting the next, it was transferred to a Mandarin speaking person who claimed he is a customer service representative from MOH Singapore. I hung up after explaining i cannot understand/Speak mandarin. No money involved, as i hung up.
I received a scam call on 19.5.21, 3pm, from +6597628100. When i picked up it was an automated voicemail from MOH in mandarin saying that i was placed under quarantine order. Immediately after there was the option to speak to a “moh officer”, which i pressed. The call was then connected to the “officer” who said i needed to be placed under quarantine because i was found to have accessed tan tock seng hospital on 14.5.21 from contact tracing. Apparently someone with a china-number sim card had gone to ttsh and was at risk of exposure to someone with covid, and moh had tried to get in touch with him. However, they could not contact him, so they did some tracing and found that my particulars were used to register this china number in beijing in march 2021. That’s how the call led to my handphone number, he said. I told him it wasn’t me. The moh officer said that if it isn’t, then it could be a serious leak of personal information. There was nothing he could do but he pretended to speak to his “superior”, who said that because of the severity of the covid situation, they needed to be able to find this person. He also suggested making a police report to the beijing police to prevent my personal details from being used further, and he asked for my family member to act as my witness. He immediately connected the call to the "beijing police station."This “MOH officer” seemed helpful throughout, and gave details such as his employee number, name, my quarantine order code, and the correct moh hotline to call back. Even though he spoke in chinese the whole way, he said it was because he was from the moh branch that specializes n communications with Chinese nationals for this matter during this covid period. The “beijing police” asked for my mother's and my passport nr, nric, address and our family member's whereabouts. He said a police report had to be lodged and recorded as a video, so we used whatsapp video to communicate. My mother gave her whatsapp number. He said he would call us using +86 10 110. We saw his face, and he was fully dressed in uniform, for the first few seconds of the call. But for the lodging of the police report he said it was their regulations to record a one-way video, so his video was off after. After he recorded our details, we heard his “colleague” knock at the door, telling him my mother and i were found in their china police system to have opened a bank of china joint account which was flagged for involvement in money laundering. Too many things felt strange, so i asked for the joint account nr so that we can report to singapore police as well. He refused to give it to us. He claimed that another officer will call us. I received this new officer’s message and calls almost immediately.
Please Beware of fake phone calls pretending to be from "MOH" I received an impersonating phone call from +659625491? pretending to be from MOH, using automated Chinese voice machine.
I have been receiving scam calls. This morning, I received one ( 9431 3492) from 'ministry of health. it claimed the authority had been trying to contact me to get my vaccine jab and I needed to press '9' to get in touch with them. Both english and Mandarin were used. i had both my shot done recently. This is the first time i received such call from MOH. at this difficult period of time, i hope public are advised not to fall into this latest scam. thank you.
I needed a loan and submitted my name &amp; contact detils to a few companies found on advertisement online. Benson, impersonating as staff of a licensed moneylender contacted me under these number 8255 938? and 6978 841. After approving my loan, we discussed &amp; signed the contract for $16k loan. He demanded upfront payment of $1,387 as to secured the loan before the 16k is released. I paid on the fees as requested. After banking the money into this account 701-305-43?? UOB, He then sent me a screenshot of a 26k UOB bank transfer made to me. He says their Credit Department made a mistake and his manager would like to offer this 26K loan amount He apologized and offered a good deal for the extra 10k, so now will need to have SGD2234 and to top up another SGD847 on top of the transferred SGD1387 I sensed something wrong, called up my OCBC to stop this transaction and I checked on Scam Alert online and found out that this situation is similar to other scam stories shared here, I headed to lodge a police report immediately I lost $1,387 in total.

Received a spoof call from "Singtel". The person on the other line said they were from Singtel tech support an there were problems with internet access in the network. They wanted to speak with whoever paid the bill and tried to verify information with me. I hung up at this point. providing the number above as they appear to be using a singapore phone number.
Received call from 6429358? with no sound at first. This already triggered my alert since most scams call start with first 5-10 seconds of silence, maybe due to overseas connection. Anyway, After about 6 seconds, a male voice with South Asian accent said he was calling from singtel technical support and that the purpose of the call was to check on my Internet connection. This confirmed it was an impersonator since I am not a singtel customer. But I continued to play along to waste their time and money on the call and to see what else they would say. The modus operandi was similar to other stories shared - unauthorised usage of my Internet at night by 20-25 devices hacking the network. By which time, I was really not keen to listen anymore so I said I am not a singtel customer and I am recording this call. The caller hung up immediately. No financial loss, just time and some brain cells.
caller claims to be a ministry of health (MOH) official. I have uncollected health documents that need to be retrieved. I needed to follow the caller's instructions, which I didn't.
I received a text message from 932082?? with the below detail: [SingPost]You have the goods to be signed. Please check: https://is.gd/mI9OBA When I click there link, I was directed to a fake singpost website. https://singpost-rua.top/sg/phone.php (Important note: Do not click on the phishing link.) I did not proceed further. Nothing was lost.
A man called my wife's mobile number and knew her name. He said he was from MOH and that she had been traced to a potential covid 19 contact at novena on 8th may and must go into quarantine. my wife said she hadn't been to novena on 8th may, so this was not possible. the caller became aggressive and said that if she didn't comply, she would be breaking the law. my wife stood her ground, saying that she did nothing wrong and did not go to novena on that date. the caller asked how many family members are at the home and she said 4, husband and 2 kids. the caller said someone would come over shortly to pick her up to go to quarantine. of course, nobody came but what if she had been a vunerable person? we checked her trace together app, which had no concerns and this morning I called moh &amp; reported it. They said i should report here also. the call was from a +65 number, which we know is bad news but my wife was busy and didn't notice. the man spoke fluent english and mandarin.
Received an sms: singpost: we have issues with your shipping address for redeliver your package to your address pleas click here: https://bit.ly/3edn0xx (Note: Phishing website, do not click). if click on the link it goes to a look-alike singpost page but its not the real singpost website. In that fake website, you will received a tracking number and it will request your to fill in your personal info. Click and copy that tracking number and then go to google and search for singpost tacking webpage, in the real singpost parcel tracking page, you can paste the copied tracking number and it will come up with invalid. Why i know the webpage is fake because 1,the sms containsd many grammar and spelling errors. 2.certain links on the fake webpage are not clickable. 3. Why singpostl need all my personal info 4. Copy and track the number and used it on the real webpage 5. I did not order anything currently.
Received a call from the scammer stating that he was from singtel's security team. Was requested to share computer screen and showed me that there were people from overseas using my internet. Soon after, i realised it was a scam and hung up the phone.
I received call from DBS bank several time saying they tried to contact several times for urgent matter and asked to press "3" to talk to person. Then if I did, a man with a strong Chinese accent would speak to me. When I asked to use English, then hang up. It happened several time from different phone numbers.
Was contacted by phone +65 9042 6985, the guy claimed to be a singtel tech. Told me my internet had been hacked by 20-25 users. I was then forwarded to their "chief technician" Michael, who tried to get access to my computer by having me to first get a netstat via terminal, and then have me to download teamviewer. I 'smelled smoke in the kitchen' by then and didn't download....I pretended to have a bad connection on the phone with him and hung up. I lost nothing but time!
They claimed they are doing "affiliated marketing" with online platforms like lazada, shoppee, zalora to boost reviews and sales. Then they will ask you to join a group, requiring my details and bank account(in order to credit your commisiion). They will send you a link from lazada/shoppee for random items, will ask you add to cart but do not checkout, instead they asked you to bank in to his/her personal account, and claimed that after payment, they will reward you with item price + 10% commission.I find the job really suspicious and did not proceed further.
I needed a loan and submitted my name &amp; contact to a few companies found on google. Josh from s g credit called &amp; asked for my ic pic &amp; finance personal infoAfter approving my loan, we discussed &amp; signed the contract for 10k loan. He demanded upfront 500 processing fee &amp; 400 interest payment before the 10k is released. I paid He then sent me a screenshot of a 20k uob bank transfer made to me. He says the amount will be reflected in my account shortly, and i have to transfer him back the extra 10k he sent by mistake. He apologised and offered a good deal for the extra 10k. I signed another contract for the 20k new deal and paid another 400 interest But the 20k hasn’t appeared in my bank. He checked and said it is stuck with MAS. He then sent me an email from mas requiring me to pay 3k refundable validation fee to receive 20k + 3k. So i paid after that, he sent me another email from UOB requiring me to pay 5k immediate transfer fee to receive 23k + 5k. I sensed something wrong, so i forwarded the email to both mas &amp; uob to enquire a proof of authenticity. Both said that there’s no such thing. How did the scammer make the email addresses, letterhead etc. Look absolutely legit? I headed to lodge a police report immediately. I lost $4300 in total.

This happened to my best friend. She does not want to report to the police as she did not lose any money and she feels embarrassed that she fell for a scam.She was on a dating app and chatted with this mature looking chinese man who claimed to be a successful entrepreneur looking to expand his agro tech and cryptocurrency projects to Singapore. He is currently based in the Sates.She fell in love with him after some months of chatting online and over the phone. I did warn her that it sounds like a scam because why would a successful us-based businessman be on a dating app to look for love? But she told me he is real and that she is aware of scams so she will be careful.One day he asked her to be a co-investor together with him in his new Singapore-based business and also told her that he wants to come to Singapore to find her. She was about to transfer $5k to his us-based agent to handle the company registration but as she was quite broke at the time, she asked if she could wait until next salary month. Then that guy kept rushing her, that was when she felt something was wrong. She asked him more questions about his company and finally he ghosted her.At first she felt depressed and wondered if it was her fault. Only after our friends met up to cheer her up, she then told us this story and we helped her realised it was really a scam.
I got a call from mobile number + 65 8375 2055 few times. it says "this is DBS bank. We have tried to contact you several times, please press 3 immediately" . I didnt press and hang up . i call back to find out but the line is engaged. i have blocked the number.
A person claiming he is from Singtel called and asked to check the Singtel modem at my home. He mentioned that the modem had problem and needed to be verified. I told him that this check had to be done on site by Singtel and I would verify with singtel regarding the check authenticity. Paul William got agitated and said that he would get singtel to charge me for him to come over and Singtel would ban a user like me to not follow its instruction. I called up Singtel subsequently to verify whether such check was valid. Singtel told me that there was no such checks and this had to be reported to the anti scam department for record.
This guy called claiming to be from Singapore high court and told me i needed to attend a hearing. he then proceeded to get my ic and name and told me that i was involved in money laundering. i caught up to it the moment he said it was money laundering, but they have my full name and ic, which means they can do more fraudulent activities using my personal particulars. Please be wary and do not give in to provide more personal details despite caller having more of your personal details.
Received called from MOH, saying that I have a document to be collected and press 3 to retrieve the document. Claiming that I have purchased contraband in China and tried to courier back to singapore. Then followed by transferring call to "CHINA Interpol" to assist in the Investigation, which then using whatsapp to communicate. Very "professionally" executed with forged police ID, police report and so on......I knew it was a scam call and thus No bank account given and No money lost but just want to warn others of this scam.
I received an impersonating phone call pretending to be from MOH, using automated Chinese voice machine. Please note that MOH officers will not make any calls via automated voice machines.
I just received an sms from official singtel number, and this was the message:We decided to send a little gift to all our customer of 132.49 sgd for their loyalty to our program .please click here to claim it : https://bit.ly/3ueitvo (Impt: Phishing link, do not link)Https://okulumuyonet.com/x/cc1.php?validation=true (Impt: Phishing link, do not link)The link asked me to key in my credit card details to claim a cashback, but this was so dubious because the website looks exactly like singtel page but the icons like the chat bot, and homepage all do not work!! The web link led you a phishing website that looks like singtel.com but it isn't, and they mentioned 5% vat which was not a singapore term!!
Received a call that claimed to be from MOH and that i have yet to submit important information to them and i need to do so asap, when i was told to press 3, i just hung up. went to moh's website to confirm my doubt and it was true, it is stated that the moh will not call us with an automated voice message. i will make an online police report for this matter. i urge members of the public to ignore this number, 9033 3448 as it is a scam. always check with official website, and proceed to make a police report.
Saw online ad fuss free loan, contacted them and they says loan approval immediately, they ask for my ic front and back. When I realised something is wrong, too late, they ask u pay a admin charge of $3500 upfront before the loan.
Called in mentioning he is from Singtel. My Singtel ACCOUNT had an unusual spike in data usage so he need my details and particulars. I Do not BELIEVE as household internet is always unlimited usage and my handphone data is always more than enough. It sound SUSPICIOUS. After hung up the phone, I call Singtel to verify. It turned out that no one called and I confirmed that it was a scam.
Please do not engage These LOAN financial experts from FB. They are using real companies DETAILS, pictures, license and address. Don't trust when they say fuss free applications. I have been scammed of $2200. Lesson learned the hard way. On 5 may 2021, I chanced upon this GS credit Singapore on FB. I was looking for a loan of $5000 with repayment terms of 12mths. I did a check AND the LICENSE no. and office address is legitimate, included in THE moneylenders LIST. My MISTAKE WAS not CALLING the real phone number instead of the person HENRY. I asked why cannot go office, Henry said due to CURRENT pandemic SITUATION, meet up was stopped They will ASK for your ic, BANK statements and next of kin's contacts. Do not give anything to them. In short, AFTER their 'VALIDATION process', THEY WILL then ask you to send $500 deposit to them but They will DEPOSIT $250 to your bank account. After that they make you wait for some time, contract states you have to pay $750 as insurance for them if you default on your payments. Its when they send you a TAX invoice by Credit Bureau Singapore which told me that i was scammed. They ASK me to clear the 'govt Tax" in order to transfer the LOAN to be completed. I told them I will CHECK CBS for the validity and THEY panicked. I will pay them the extra if really I was taxed on the Next day. The 'finance" guy said ok and said I will get the LOAN the next day. I immediately made a police REPORT and informed CBS and blocked And report them from whatsapp. There's definitely a few of them.

I was called by a woman who called herself Debbie (with an Indian accent) claiming to be from Singtel saying that our internet usage is high. We don’t use Singtel that’s why i knew it was a scam so I hung up without saying anything. Then blocked their phone number. The background sounded really noisy and the person was eating. The call was on 6 May 2021 at 15:09.
1) Was using a dating app with purple coloured logo, intro by my friend. At first there's this girl who is keen to BEFRIEND me and asked for my number, and i gave her. 2) weeks later after we chat through WhatsApp, she mentioned that she's providing special services @ $60/hour 3) we then make an appointment, knowing that it might possibly be a scam. 4) as expected when I reach the destination, she mentioned that her friend would give me a call for security purpose. 5) when I was requested to pay via razor gold credits, i pretended that the signal was weak and forced them to drop the line. 6) i left the location, but I received a few calls from both the girl and her so called friend, and also received a video that a victim was SLASHED and some threatening voice message via WhatsApp mentioning to use my photo and phone number to track my residential address and send the girl to me the next day. 7) In the end, i simply blocked them and contacted my police officer friend regarding this matter and made a police report. For those who are using dating apps, please beware and think twice.

Luckily, i do not have a Singtel broadband connection and told him so, at which point he hung up immediately. phone transcript below Scammer: hello, my name is eric from Singtel.

I've recently fallen into a loan scam, came across this SMS ads and i wanted to take a loan for my credit card bills, i tired communicating with the scammer and they reassure me that this is a legit company source which they provided me with company details (credi? hu? capita?) and even forged their company letter head for me to endorse the agreement. This whole incident happened on the 29th april and within an hour i've lost more than $3,500. Please avoid contacting such organisation &amp; I hope that everyone in need of money will visit an actual loan agency to prevent themselves from getting scammed Editor's Note: Please note that unlicensed moneylenders can impersonate as licensed moneylenders by creating fake websites using their details.

The caller claims to be from MOH, speaking in fluent mandarin, spoken about I have covid 19 vaccine claimed from guangzhou renmin hospital and the vaccines are to be arranged to be sent to singapore.

They kept asking me to verify my phone and postal code address and even asked if i knew where they are call from. told them off as scam organisation trying scam me and the caller immediately hung up on me.
The caller identified first as ALOK KUMAR SINGH FROM HCI and said that there was some incorrect information provided by me in the immigration form and a legal case has been raised against me. i suspected the call to be scam and asked how can i trust then he said to check the phone number with the HCI website. it was matching and i started believing them. then he transferred the call to some guy who identified himself as thang lee, senior vigilance officer. he was threatening that my passport would be impounded and i will be imprisoned for 10 years with a fine of sgd 70k. . he was asking me to go to delhi to get the case cleared and as an alternative he was asking for sgd 2,700 as fees to be paid to clear my case.

Recently, the phone scammers changed their tactics. It is no longer the "I called you many times regarding your DBS account", but has become "there is something wrong with your vaccination, please press #".
An indian caller claimed to be from singtel alleging my internet security was breached for the last few days But i'm not singtel subscriber and she said all lines ride on singtel, which i bought because I am on myrepublic. She asked me to go check my router and tell her what lights i see. In true honestly i have like 5 different black boxes outside that i have no idea which does what. after trying many times to ask her to tell me which one does she exactly need me to check, i told her i cant help if you dont tell me what you want. she hung up.
Received a call impersonating as starhub stating there are illegal activities in my localtiy using my home internet. Asked details about router model, which lights blinking etc.. Asked me to go in front of a system/connected device (they insisted a windows pc rather than mac or ipad for obvious reasons). Confronted them stating, i didn't believe and asked them to summarize the technical issue as i am from it too.. Call was hung up...

I have recently received multiple calls from various numbers. Therefore, I decided to pick up one of the calls although i know that it was a scam. The phone call started from an automated voice recording saying that i have missed multiple calls from dbs bank. for more clarification, press "3". i followed accordingly, and a man's voice was heard saying in china chinese "hello this is dbs bank pte ltd etc.". I replied asking if he knows how to speak english (which should be the standard language if the bank was to call you), and he hung up on my phone call.
I was browsing for money lending options and i received a message from a loan consultant claimed to be from “jm? credi?”. Did a quick look up from ministry of law website, and saw the license number tally with the letterhead provided on the loan application, therefore i assured that it was a licensed money lender. Started engaging with the representative on monday (19 april 2021). Upon receiving "official agreement", they requested for further payments due to i'm an e-pass holder. Over the days, amount of random "fees" gradually increase amounted to sgd $22,000. Eventually i figured that this group of scammers are imposters, using other's licensed company name to convinced that they are from that companyEditor's Note: Please note that unlicensed moneylenders can impersonate as licensed moneylenders by creating fake websites using their details.

I checked my email and got one that informed me to pay for shipping. While I did not have any outstanding shipping payments to be made, I thought that it got to do with my purchase on Shopee. The phishing email got a link that took me to this website: https://nhansamlinhchi.net.vn/wp-content/plugins/sg-post/e5cb020375da07c/payment.php?payment#?fbclid=iwar3am6b1og_8mxyeouk573kwes3uc8nqzlbs-dfh_2ztutz44t_kiowxgQQ (Note: Phishing site.

I received a call on 20 apr 2021 afternoon, he seems to have an indian accent. he introduced himself as calling from singtel technical department and asked if i faced any internet connectivity issue recently. i said i don't use singtel. although i had doubts about the authenticity of this call at this point, i listened on since i do experience slow internet. he quickly responded that the lines offered by other telco (e.g. m1, starhub, myrepublic) are all sub lines under singtel. he proceeded to mention he's calling because he noticed my internet usage spiked significantly over the last 5 days in my household and asked if i have any friends or family that came over. i said no and further mentioned that i have no internet line signed under my name, and asked if he got the wrong number. he repeated my mobile number and asked if this is my contact. i said yes but repeated that there is no internet line under my name. he then asked for the contact of the person who has the internet line. i asked - shouldn't he have the information from his database? after a moment of silence, he hung up.
The SCammer called me few times, just happened today I PICKep up the call as I am off day at home. At first was a voice msg stated I have a mail / documents yet to collect from DBS. And the scammer connect my CALL n told me I have a credit card applied at Shanghai but the credit is unpaid. It was occurred on Feb n March 2021. I found ridiculous as I never been to Shanghai before. So I told the scammer, "FIRST I have a very good creditworthiness, I am never Been late in credit card payment. Second, during Feb n March, I was in Malaysia. So you may report to police n file official case as I am victim of scam as well if what you say are true." He then required me to go the HQ office at marina bay, which I refused and say I could only go to nearest DBS branch if needed. I insist we could make a police report n ask him full name and title, then he get panic n hang up the phone. Usually I will not ANSWER the voice msg, however this time round I did because I was away from Singapore for 6months. I thought maybe it was REAL that I have document stuck at bank. Somehow feel tiring....
I was contacted by Nxxxx Lee, a consultant from XX Credit Pte Ltd, after approaching them for a loan. As part of the loan, I had to provide my particulars and pay an initial processing fee.After making this initial fee payment, I started receiving emails from UOB (banking.alert@uob.com), MAS (info@mas.gov.sg), OCBC (banking.alert@ocbc.com) and ISD (isd_feedback@mha.gov.sg) requesting for various type of fee/tax payments before I could receive the loan amount. I realised later that all these were phishing emails, not sent by these organisations at all!All in all I have paid a total fee amount of $86,777 across multiple transactions to various “agencies” for a loan amount of $200,000. Till date I have yet to receive any money from the consultant or the company.

Recently I texted someone on WhatsApp for a $5000 loan. They told that they were from "Golden licensed moneylender". I provided pictures of the front and back of my I/C, CPF, statement and bank account details for approval but she went quiet shortly after that. The same day, I received a fund transfer of $200 from an unknown person. The next day I received a text from a person by the name of Sam Wong, 93710456 hp number, saying that I will need to return back $350 as they have given me the $200, which I didn't even asked for. Had a little exchange of words over WhatsApp and told him that I won't pay anything more than the $200 he had transferred to me. But he ignore and say that he will provide an account number next week for me to transfer the money.. So I insisted that the $200 would not be used and I would return it back to him as I didn't not even ask for the $200. he threatened me with videos and picture of ah longs burning and harassing people. I've made a police report with regards to this. I am still waiting for the stupid ah long (Sam Wong) to provide me with the account number so that I could return his $200. I blocked his number and all unknown. Beware of loan scams!

First connect them through fb (her name is Janet yeoh), who claimed that her company needed an account admin. They asked me to provide my bank account details in order to credit my salary to me. Next, I felt something WRONG as a huge sum of money has been credited into my bank account. They asked me just check the amount and send back to company acc. After 5 DAYS my bank account got frozen and I was being suspected to be involved in some scams! I was so SCARED! the scammer said if needed to settle this case, they have professional officers who can do it under TABLE and dismissed all the charges, the cost is 10K.... And I truly believed them, after that I cash deposit for them, they said needed another $5K. This time, I truly realized that it's a scam. I did some research online and found out similar cases. I felt silly to share my bank account details with them without checking. I HOPE every person please aware this kind of job scam and please remember don't provide your bank account number to anyone and if you have received money in your bank account, report the matter to the bank and police immediately. Do NOT touch the money
Recently looking for a licensed moneylender to borrow $5K, while approving to get the loan they actually tell me to go through a short term before I can loan the amount of 5K because I am a first timer, so here how it goes, he told me to provide NRIC and a saving bank account. Once I did, he transferred me an agreement on WhatsApp than he said he will transfer me a $400 but after the deduction of the admin fee($100) in the end transferred me $300 and charged me a interests of $300 so I have to return in 5 days a total amount of $600, but til now the person remain uncontactable after transferring me the $300, maybe he wanted to delay and tell me to pay more in the interests, this is all For everyone out there, please be vigilant and be aware of this person using this kind of method charging you interests and threatening people, I had made the police report.

We met on an online dating app. He took time to convinced me that he was a real deal by having a regular work schedule time to talk only during the so called free time and sending photos of his daily activities once in a while. His excuse for not being in Singapore was he needed to visit his parents back in China and needed some time before coming back to Singapore. He started sharing how he has a side income through cryptocurrency usdt trading. Despite my initial reluctance, he insisted that I should try. The initial amount started at only usd$800 but over time he would pretend to put in money to my-so called account and pretend to trade on the app with me to earn money. There was emotional pressure and time pressure put on me to put in the investments as he claimed he went to borrow money just to enable my account to trade in the highest category section. The worst was he actually had a fake relative who joins the chat to pretend that he was a real deal too. Eventually their fake advice ended up making me lose all my so called investments. Which is probably all fake transactions on a trading platform. The biggest fear now is my data floating out there since real data of photo ID had to be submitted for creating an account. Do not trust any Chinese successful professional online whom you do not see in real life and don't invest unless it is an accredited Mas investment products. I was emotionally affected by the experience and lost my common sense to judge rationally.
Scammer tried to impersonate as Singtel staff but i didn't listen to his whole story before i told him I was busy and asked him to hurry up which he promptly hanged up.
This scammer has been calling me many times using different phone numbers SUCH AS 89131767, 80337969, 88077733 but every time start with the same recording "You have aN URGENT MASSAGE from DBS bank. Press "1" to contact our customer services for more details. Once I PRESSED 1 and IT connected me to a PERSON WHO Greets me in Chinese "Hello! Thank you CONNECTING tO DBS Bank, PLEASE PROVIDE ME YOUR SINGPASS to proceed further". I asked him can he speak in English. He said "NO". This is the Chinese CS department" and then ask me "can you speak in Chinese?" in English. I replied "No", then he dropped my call.
I received a call on my mobile number at 8.35am on 15 April 2021. The call apparently was from the High Court and i was directed to the information desk. a male answered the call. when i said that I received a call from this number stating that it is from the high court, he said that maybe I have a court hearing and the officer in-charge was trying to contact me. he also mentioned that I have a court hearing on 19 April 2021, at 9am, for a money laundering case. I said that i am not involved in any court hearing. he asked for my full name and NRIC number for verification. i told him that i am not involved in any court cases and i am going to report this call to the police and hung up.
There was this person called (number +65 98444297) my wife on 27 March 2021 saying that the call was from Starhub and her phone connection going to be cancelled in 2 hours due to the number was used in china to register for some illegal activity. sadly my wife fell into the trap and continued conversation with the scammer. later the scammer assured my wife that, they already did the necessary and her starthub account will not be cancelled. after more than 30 minutes of conversation, the person told her that she will get a call from another number and answer only to that number. Also told her not to discuss about this to anyone. within a short time, she got a call from +86 2162310110 number and that number claimed her that they were calling from shanghai police department. they also talked to her for a while saying that her number was used for some illegal activity. During this time i noticed that my wife was talking in phone for quite sometime and looked panicky. So I asked her who was that. then the scammer asked her to go to a quiet room so that he can record some details clearly. i intervened at this moment and asked her to hang up the phone immediately. when the scammer heard my voice, he himself hang up the call. Please don't fall into such traps. starthub or other company will not call and cancel any service within such short notice and they will never inform you such matter over phone. although she talked to them quite sometime, no confidential information had been shared with scammer other than phone number. hopefully everything will be fine
Caller with a thick indian accent claimed to be calling from singtel . mentioning that there is a surge in my internet usage. asked me to hold on the line to speak to his senior technician named sam thomas who asked me to go infront of my laptop to key in some details. When i asked for verification of my address and name he did not have it and started shouting at me saying that i dont understand how serious this is. He hung up once I told him I knew it was a scam.
I got a call with an Indian guy around 9:20am, the call volume was really soft at the start and when i got him to turn the volume up, he kept cutting out. When i could finally hear him, I asked him to identified himself. He ignored it as though he didn't hear me before proceeding to ask if i was the one paying the internet bills which i did answer yes. He then said that abnormal usage was detected on my wifi throughout the night (something along the lines of 25 users using my wifi during the night) and asked if i shared my wifi password with anyone. I then asked him to identify himself and he finally answered that he is from singtel. Since I had no internet lines with singtel, it was obviously a fake so i put down the call straight away. Do note that he not once tried to even confirm my identity and address which a real telco would have done 1st before even sharing any info from their end. Also, real telco knows who their calling and will not make unsolicited phone calls informing you that there are problems with your internet connection!
A guy with strong Indian accent called saying they received feedback of slow and lagging internet connection. Later, he claimed that my connection was used by others from overseas to carry out illegal activities under my name. This is such a common scam. Beware!
Phone call came, claiming he is from singtel security department. Asked to check router and told me that there are a huge number of people using my internet connection. when i asked for a local number to call back in case the line gets cut off, he was not able to provide. gave a 9 digit number. when i asked why, the caller got angry. first, claimed they are external vendor appointed by singtel, after that, claimed they are singtel when i asked for the vendor's company name. also, they will transfer the line to another 'colleague' who will help to solve the issue. i asked for a number to call back again but was turned down. reason being, they have a huge flow of customers to assist, so if i call back, they can help me immediately. so i said to call back 30mins later. I called singtel after that to verify and was informed, similar cases of scam.
This scammer has been calling me a few times. It use different phone numbers but every time start with the same recording "You have a message from DBS bank. Press "1" to contact our customer services for more details. Once I am connected to a human, he Greets me at in Chinese "Hello! Thank you for calling DBS Bank" (which Is not me made the call!) I asked him if she can speak in English. He said "NO. This is the Chinese CS department" and then ask me "can you speak in Chinese?" in English. I replied "No", then he dropped my call. I literally don't know what kind of info they wanted to phish but I guess they tried to "verify" my personal details.
He called using the number above and claimed that he is from Singtel about "slowness" in my home network.

He called using the number above and claimed that he is from Singtel about technical issues. He has a strong Indian accent. when i told him, i didnt make any calls to singtel, he immediately hung up on me.
Nothing's lost and i just want to share the scam number so that people can block it. the guy claimed he is calling from telecommunication authority of Singapore and spoke out my name. he spoke mandarin all the way and had clear mainland china accent. he checked if my mobile number belongs to me and i said yes. then he said some misconduct was observed under my mobile line. It sounds like he was reading a script. i straight interrupted him and told him to shut up and hang the phone. I know i didn't mis-use my sim card and even if i did, any investigation should be done by police or singtel, instead of Singapore tel authority.
I usually receive robocalls but this morning I spoke to a person who claimed to be from call from a Chinese lady claiming she's from DB. She shared that she has a document for me and requested that I go visit someplace to collect it. I am concerned as she VERIFIED my full name WHEN I ANSWERED THE CALL.
I am shijo and work in cyber security industry. This report is just to help others and maybe the authorities to better educate the public at large or track down the syndicate. i picked up the call and started the conversation fully aware that it was a scam call. myintention was to understand scammers real motive so that i can probably alert others who may be less computer savy. I recorded the whole coversation too. this is how the call progressed... 1.i received a call from this scammer (i could hear other agents too. so this is a big team) 2.i was told that the call is from singtel tech support 3.the caller claims that my internet was being used by ohers illegaly 3.the caller asked me to go through a series of steps on my computer to convince me that many external forces are connected to my computer. they wanted me to run 'netstat' commands 4.i pretended that i was following their insructions when i was not 5.as i work in cyber security, i am very well aware of those commands and the expected output. so i played along to understand their real intention without running any single command --------- so here it is: ultimately the scammer wants you to access a remote control website and download their remote control executable so that they will be able to login remotely and take over your computer. website name: ultraviewer.net (i never accessed this site as i didnt want any drive by download or pugings to be installed on my comuter) i just wanted to share the scammers mode of operandi and hope this helps others. thanks
I share this story to make all the females out there to be more aware that love scammer needs to be taken seriously. This love scammer is so professionally manipulative. Scammer bio: match on tinder, korean born in france, work in HK, has thick French accent 34yo, contractor engineering, raised in orphanage since 4yo. Based on my experiences, i summarize his characteristics: 1. In the beginning, he will say hello on tinder and after several chats, asked to move to chat platform in my case is Whatsapp. 2. After a few days, he will confess his feelings to you and wants to have a future with you and meet your parents (to convince you how serious he is) 3. He will chat and call you every day, and keep saying will meet you in person soon and will buy you a flight ticket to visit him. 4. He is willing to invest his energy and time in you and being so patience until he wins your trust and heart. Don’t be surprised if he is willing to do this for a long time, my case was 1 month, some were more than 6 months. 5. He said want to settle down and buy a house in Singapore and asked me to find out how much the house price (wow…so convincing right?) 6. Once he knew you fall for him and gain your trust. He will suddenly tell you that something bad happened to him. After 3 weeks of chatting, he told me he will travel overseas to win a contract and showed his picture on a flight. He told me he needs to pay for the unexpected contract registration for about usd15,000 and he was out of cash. He said he cannot use his france card because it is not activated for overseas use and needs 4 working days, so he was asking me shyly to lend him usd2000 to survive for 4 days. He asked to transfer to his driver’s bank account or his bitcoin. At first, i rejected and he said it’s alright, it’s not your fault and comforted me which is his technique to make you feel guilty and worried about him even more as it is real. He even said i still love you no matter what, saying good night as usual. The next day, i felt bad as “his woman” so i almost transferred to his bitcoin but thank god i went through this website before going to the atm.Overall, there are obvious signs from love scammer: 1. He will never do a video call with you even after you ask several times. 2. He will never show you any of his social media (even he does then you need to check with google image or bing) 3. He will never meet you in person even he has been texting and calling you regardless how long. 4. In any circumstances, do not ever transfer any money/ invest to a person you have never met in person period!
From the contact number and from his words is already suspicious. He claimed to be from "MOM" and that my bank got frozen and need to reactivate. i told him I got no bank account and then he kept on explaining. I kept on saying i got no bank account He got fed up and said ok sir have a good day
I just received a called to said that he is from DBS Marina, he speaks only Mandarin (can't communicate in english), he said his name is Tan Boo? Pi?. He said I have applied a DBS card in China DBS branch on 10/2/2021 and I had purchased a Iphone equivalent to SGD$1,300. He even said that the DBS China branch had verified my particulars before giving me the DBS credit card...... he then continued to tell me all other information about my application of DBS card in China, I certainly regard these as nonsense. I denied everything that he said and I challenged him with multiple questions, he can't answer. He then said they will send the transaction history to DBS Singapore and to MAS, I told him please send the info today asap. I also told him that I am working in Cybersecurity service, don't try to fool me, He hang up The phone number is +6596398274 (this is definitely a fake display number), he said his name is Tan Boo? pi?
I was told that my I/C will expired in 2 hours and I have to press any option to get the matter resolved. I tried to call back but its a Starhub registered mobile line and the caller cannot be reached.
Beware of scammer! once you pick up a "DBS" automated message be played and then they will prompt you to press '3' to know why your acc has issues. Then a guy, with a strong Chinese accent asked for my name and details. I told the guy that I worked at dbs and i want his agent code, gave me 5768888, and said his name is he wen yi. scolded him real good over the phone because of how many people were scammed especially old folks and hung up on the scammer. they called me 3 times this week alone. beware of this kind of scammers! DBS will not use automated to call you! most dbs calls using english not speak in Mandarin also unless you request! please know the difference!
I received a robocall from “the supreme court” and that numerous calls were made to me and that I have not responded To any of the call and to press 8 To proceed. I was transferred to a Chinese speaking man asking me how he can help me. I responded by asking whether he could speak in English which He shockingly replied in English with a heavy Chinese accent askIng again how he could help me. I told him i have no idea as they were the one who called me. He said he was from the CHECKING department and i asked checking department from where and he replied “the supreme court”. I told him i had no dealing with the supreme court so i don’t know what this Is about and he again ask why i choose to be transferred to checking department which i told him that i didn’t. This went back and forth for awhile with him claiming I requested to transfer the call to him and me telling him i didn’t directed the call anywhere. Finally he sprouted some vulgarities at me and hung up on me.
Incident took place after searching online and applying interest in getting a legit loan for investment. Contact personnel was via whatsapp and seemed legit but after transferring some "processing" fees, they continue to ask for more that is out of agreement and eventually turned into a cheating case.Lost few thousands but worst of all is they threaten my household using my address and details. Don't ever reply to a whatsapp or put your interest online.Editor's note: Unlicensed moneylenders or scammers might pose as licensed moneylenders to cheat.

Person called me using the number 68920830 with a strong Indian accent. Claimed to be from the technical dept of singtel. Claimed to be calling regarding my internet connection (but i do not have a singtel internet account at all). I asked her who is looking for (i. E. Name, house address etc). But she could not provide it. Claimed that as it is a call recorded for training purposes, she could not say the details in the call. Just kept saying that she is looking for the "house owner of this internet connection", which sounds extremely fishy. She said she wanted nothing but my time. I didn’t bother and hung up. Editor's note: Please note that scammers will use spoofing technology to create fake numbers to cover their tracks. Numbers shown on users' Caller IDs are often invalid numbers or belonging to people who did not make the calls. The most effective measure against such phone impersonation scams is to be able to identify the scam and hang up.
A call from a lady (sounded like Indian) who identify as Singtel internet service provider. Later, she passed the call to her so called technician to get more information. This guy called micheal (sounds like Filipino) said a lot of hackers around 20+ hackers have been actively hacked into my system. He would try to guide me by using my computer to identify the hackers. He asked me to typed "cmd" run the files. And ask me to read out the details to him. I paused and asked can i call Singtel to verify this call. He started to get panic and told me he was a third party that Singtel engaged and no records. When I insisted and he hung up the phone. I would like to share this incident as I hope no one will fall in their prey. Thanks for reading.
i met this chinese guy at CMB named dunn, Chinese name : deng bo hong. chatted abit on the app before moving to whatsapp. he appeared as an owner of 2 transportation companies in johor and sg. he will text initially ever so often like morning, afternoon and night. at some nights, he will appear to be having late night calls with europe but when i asked europe is only 7 hours difference, he stuttered for awhile to answer. he can text in english but when he went over to whatsapp, he asked to text in chinese. that's my 1st red flag. 2nd red flag : dad passed away so went back to johor with the mom from shanghai. 3rd red flag : occasionally, he would mentioned about cryptocurrency as well as asked about whether my house is bought. and he will mentioned that he is coming back to Singapore and will be quarantined here 1 month later from jb. he also state that he have 2 properties in sg: Holland and Bukit Timah (too good to be true here...) the final flag came when he asked if i would like to invest 1000SGD in cryptocurrency and look at the returns. when i say i am not interested, he kept on going for awhile till i said not at all. he even said he is going to do it himself now. i told him he can go ahead without looking back. i have since blocked and reported him in both whatsapp and cmb. Just want to warn everyone reading this, somethings are too good to be true. Just be careful of who u met online. all these red flags made me read a lot online on what others have shared and avoided a love scam.
He said he's are speaking from DBS bank and DBS Bank has received a regulatory ORDER from SINGAPORE GOVT THAT ALL EXPATS BANK ACCOUNTs in SINGAPORE need to be re-verified. If I failed to re-verify, then my account will be frozen for 6 months. he said this is being done because there are a lot of scams happening, and govt is trying to prevent it. I denied sharing any information. but i am concerned if i lost any critical information.
I've tried facebook dating app recently and has actually met quite a lot of fakes already. But I will share about one guy from China that chat me up and was pleasant. Very fast to profess interest. Claims to work in Singapore in the finance industry. claims to be earning very well and his investments are very successful that made him a rich man. Most of these people will try to get us to move to WhatsAPP or Line or Messenger. I did not agree to whatsapp but as I don't have much personal information on facebook Messenger, I agree to it. Facebook tries to protect people by allowing the person to see only posts that are Public if the requests is from the dating APP. All went well though there were subtle warning signs in what he shared about himself that is quite hard to believe or some contradicting information. What exposed him is that someone else (probably His partner and is part of a SYNDICATE) created a profile with photos of the same person, different name and details, and tried to befriend me too. When I ask for a VIDEO call to see if he will agree to it, He responded that he prefers to see me in person and asked for my address and that he will drive over immediately to pick me up. It is late in the night. And then he insisted that he wants to bring me to his condo to have a look. I refused his suggestion and told him that I know that he does not want to video call and then block him. I did not give him ADDRESS or meet him. when I contact him to do the video call, he told me that he was busy. That his older sister called him and is giving him information to open an account for him to trade digital currencies. He told me that it will only take about 10+ mins to do it and can earn money. He took the opportunity to ask me if I want to do it too. I declined and asked him how come he has an older sister when he had earlier shared that he has an older brother only. His response is that it is his cousin. Having stumbled on this website and read other people's stories, I think this "Sister" must be his latest victim. Please be careful.
A lady called me on my handphone saying she is from Singtel and calling me because I am using singtel internet(i am not). When I told her I don't use singtel, she said singtel is mother company of all internet providers (a red flag). She said multiple people can use my internet so she wants to make sure it's safe. She asked me to go and check how many lights are blinking on my router. As rapid blinking means 20-25 people can be using my internet. I told her it's not possible because i could see how many people are connected to my router on router admin page. She immediately cut the call.
A scammer kept calling me claiming to be singtel. I eventually caved in and answered but ignored and blocked.

Matched with this guy named herman (father singaporean, mother chinese. Parents staying in china, he is alone in sg) on cmb. He asked to move conversation to line, and requested to converse in mandarin. Asked a lot of questions, shortly after he showed a screenshot of his earnings from bitcoin trading. Subsequently claimed he loved me, wanted his future wife to be able to manage wealth etc. One day he asked if i was busy, i replied no. But when i did not reply his message he got insecure and defensive. He claimed wanted me to practice trading hands on, made me download trading app 'dtcoin' (not found in app store), create an account. Told me to contact customer service to ask what was the minimum deposit (sgd1000). Told him i did not have that much, he pestered and ask if i really didn't want to invest that night (he claims good profit). Since he was earning thousands everyday, i asked if he could lend me $1000 to trade then i return him the money once i earn my profits - he said to think of alternatives. Next day, he asked if i was able to come up with the money (claims small amount), then said that my circle of friends is too small, i didn't know the importance of money etc. Told him i trust my religion and not money, am comfortable with what i have now. He was upset and became nasty.Signed up using a mobile phone number, have since deleted the app. Looks suspicious as it requires an id number to be a verified member. Searched the line id on instagram, one account came up with the same name. However, the guy looks different from what he sent.
Need some money for my bill, saw online this dio credit so fill in the enqury for loan.

Then ask to pay admin fee then ask pay lawyer fee then said payment wrong ask to pay again then ask to pay what loan protection fee then said i gang up with his staff to cheat loan ask to pay again inorder not to go legal issue. End up i want cancel loan and he ask to pay cancel fee. After that said i froze his account and wanted me pay again. Then I blocked all number and make police report. Then they start use all different number to whatsapp to threaten with loan shark harassment tactics.

They are listed as a seller on Lazada. They were offering PS5 at a cheap price. After i made the payment on Lazada the seller asked for additional $200 as insurance and vat. they said the money will be refunded post delivery. I checked with Lazada customer care and they said not to make any payment outside the platform. the dealer then contacted me personally on Whatsapp and asked to buy it directly from their website https://unlimitedgadgets-hub.com/ . the seller asked to pay 50% upfront and remaining payment on delivery , which looked very shady from their side. the website has no reviews . glad i stopped before making any payment else that money would have gone in a gutter
Call came through to my landline (no caller id) claimed to be Singtel engineer and rattled off some job id number and work id. said someone used my internet and high data volume - may be using it for crime. said will need to transfer call to senior technician to troubleshoot the problem. immediately said not free and hung up. checked my router, no unknown devices connected. called Singtel, they said technicians will not contact you if unsolicited, also checked with Singtel my connection was ok. The caller tried to call back repeatedly, hung up all.. Beware, Indian national voice
The scammer used an automated voice system, saying that the caller is from dbs bank and i have missed to call back the bank despite repeat reminders. The automated message then instructed me to press "3" to speak to the dbs bank customer service person. I do not own any account in dbs bank. Knowing that it might be scam and out of curiosity, i pressed 3. The guy spoke to me in chinese. I informed him that i cannot speak chinese but he continued to speak to me in chinese. After repeating twice that i cannot speak chinese, he asked back in not so fluent english to confirm that i cannot speak chinese. After my confirmation, he hung up. I would like to share this experience so that no one, be it elderlies, housewives or other vulnerable people, would fall to this type of scam. I myself was a bit intrigued by the automated message. Luckily i do not own any account with dbs and that is how i realized this most likely is a scam. Regardless, please be careful, esp, if the bank calls you using robocalls and in Mandarin! Please be careful.
I received the call and when i picked up, the guy mentioned that he is from singtel. when he mentioned there was a problem with my home internet connection, I straight away hang up since I am not using Singtel.

I then asked for more details how can it be connected when i am using starhub network. they claimed they are the master network provider... and he transferred my call to their senior technician "in Starhub".. i suspected this is not right immediately hung up and block the number. I called Starhub to report the issue and they advised me that it's a scam call.
An automated voice call received saying my mobile line has been compromised and would stop working in 2 hours. I hung up.
Received a call from the above number, and was informed by anna smith (sounds like indian national) that shes from the Singtel technical dept and they detected unusual activities or connections to my wifi, and request for me to share the devices or numbers of the devices connected to my house wifi. I did not answer to her question. And informed her that i have already changed my telco for broadband and its not singtel anymore, for which she advised that all Singapore internet are provided by singtel. i asked for a number for me to call her back but she said she’s calling from headquarters and i will not be able to call them. So i asked her to call back at 2pm, while I gathered the information. However, after reading the articles posted here, I realised that this is a scam.
I received a call from the mobile no. +65 91337148 Saying the call is from Singtel to check on my internet connection , the guy asked me to check the router whether the lights are glowing etc .

I have blocked that no. on my mobile .

I received a call on my mobile. an indian lady claiming that she is from singtel technical department. She claimed that she saw some unusual traffic on my router. Immediately, i know she is a scammer as my home broadband service provider is not from singtel and it is not registered under my name. She started to say that all the service providers are still using Singtel infrastructure. I called her a scammer and ignored what she said. The conversation lasted about 3 minutes and then she cut off. As I am aware of all these phishing and scam calls, i ignore all her questions. Nothing was lost but I hope to warn others of this scam.
I got to know him from tinder. He claimed to be a hongkonger/france. Working for as wood engineer. Everything was okay till he said he has to go philippines for his contract work. He started by saying he lost his laptop, and couldn't access his online banking. Started asking money ever since. I did avoid halfway thru but he kept promising everything will be fine. I ended up giving SGD$20,000. After the last transaction he started to avoid me and that's is when I realised something not right, and lodged police report. Never trust someone who you never met. He asked money from November 14 2020 till 1 feb 2021.
I received a message saying my Internet was hacked and being used by 3rd Parties. I did not respond and ignored it. Today i received a follow-up call from "STEVe ROgers" (indian Accent) saying he would help resolve the issue. i played along long enough to see what he wanted to do - which was downloaded a "TEAMVIEW" app so he could remote fix the "ISSUE". I then refused and asked for his singtel number and ID - he gave Id number of 456139 which I am sure is fake but no phone number. I hung up and called singtel - who confirmed that it was not them and therefore a scam.Editor's Note: We would advise that members of the public do not entertain scam calls but end the calls immediately. Try not to pick up calls with the "+" or "+ 65" prefix as these are signs that the calls have originated from overseas.
I was looking for a loan on the internet and I found A money lender that seemed to be genuine, I enquired, and they offered good rate, so I agreed, they kept making me pay this fees and that fees, And in the end compromised one of my bank accounts.

I was first called up by a chinese speaking man claiming to be from IMDA with a singapore number. HE ASKED ME IF I WAS (MY FRIEND NAME) AND I REPLIED NO AND TOLD HIM MY NAME. He stated that my phone line will be cut off within the next 2 hours, saying i did some violation activities online AND HE HUNG UP.
on 18 mar 1145hrs, i received a call on my home phone. caller claimed to be a singtel engineer who said that he was following up on recent cases of internet connectivity issues. he asked me to describe the number of blinking lights on my modem. as i am not a subscriber of singtel for my home phone line, i found it suspicious and requested that the caller authenticate himself and his company. caller's voice waivered and he hung up the line after a while. Followed up with my telco to check and realised that no such engineer assistance was deployed at that hour. starhub was only able to pull out the caller id log few months later so was unable to provide accurate details to lodge a proper case. I would advise that netizens share this with their loved ones so that they can be wary of such scam calls. These impersonators are out to get your personal details, including your bank details.
The caller claimed to be from Singtel and said that they had had complaints about poor wifi connection and router problems and he was calling to check if i had any problems. The call seemed to be from a call center abroad as there was time lag. The caller had an Indian accent.
When the person IMPERSONATE that he is calling from Singtel and I noticed it is from a mobile number, I felt something was not right. He told me that they detected that my internet has been used by 20 others and I told him to send me an email on that. He said he is not able to do so and I knew he probably does not have my email information. So I knew it was a scam and ended the call. The call took place today
Google-d and saw this website loanbeesg.com (fake and now disabled website). So I went to apply, later that day received a whatsapp call from melvin who claims that he's a staff from lending bee (Which he's not). Then he Whatsapp me and ask for my Personal details (nric front &amp; back, 2 months payslip, cpf contribution, bank account number, any letter that has my name on it, next 2 kin full name &amp; contact nUmber &amp; a selfie of me holding my nric) After sending him the details, he give me a Whatsapp call that i have to sign the loan agreement &amp; upfront invoice ($2k). He then said that he has transfer me $400 to my bank account. After sigNing the agreement, i transferred him $2.4k to his uob current account which he claims that i have done it wrongly. Reference number has to be shown under Payee name and not under comment sections. Then asked to transfer another $2.4k in a correct way. After much consideration, i told him i would like to cancel the Loan application and he said i have to pay the 7% cancellation fee ($1.4k). And, so, i transfer to his dbs current account and again he said is wrong. That's when i realised that i've been scammed and went to lodge a report. Police officer in charge has ask me to block hIs number. I dont really care about the lost of money, all i'm worried now is my safety &amp; my family safety. This Has hit me hard &amp; totally a lesson learnt. No licensed moneylender will take an upfront amount when applying for loan. Licensed moneylender would always deduct whatever admin fees through your loan amount. Please be careful and spread this awareness. I'm going to change my bank account number and contact number. Just hope that they won't harrass my next 2 kin and come to my house. Praying hard!Editor's Note: Please note that unlicensed moneylenders can impersonate as licensed moneylenders by creating fake websites using their details.

Scammer called me at 4:00pm on my mobile phone number and said that someone had been arrested for money laundering and had given my name as someone involved with the money laundering. They said i had to be part of a police interview with Interpol and sent an app link to my phone to download to partake in the interview. They asked for my passport number and a photo of my passport which i provided. They also asked for my fin details which I provided. When they asked for my bank account details I disconnected the call.
Automated message call saying 'this is DBS bank we have tried to get in touch with you many times by calling and sending messages ' THATS ALL I HEARD BEFORE CUTTING THE CALL - I DONT' HAVE A DBS BANK ACCOUNT AND I ALSO GOT THE SAME SCAM CALL FROM THE NUMBER 91798719. TWICE WITHIN 5 HOURS FROM DIFFERENT NUMBERS... TOTAL SCAM BUT COULD BE CONVINCING TO SOMEONE OLDER AND UNAWARE!
I am aware of loan scams thru messages but I got scammed by a fake money lending website. I sent an inquiry about getting a loan on sglendingbee.com (Note: fake website), and moments later I was contacted by Sam (8267 7949) thru WhatsApp. He got my credentials and approved my 10k loan, but over the next few days he requested for money transfers going to these accounts: 120-718326-? and 120-557558-? amounting to S$12k (admin fee, lawyer's fee, wrong transfer name, etc). I realized I was being scammed when he mistakenly sent a photo of a successful bank transfer but used my bank account as their fake money lending account. I had since lodged a police report and now hoping that these criminals will be exposed.Editor's Note: Please note that unlicensed moneylenders can impersonate as licensed moneylenders by creating fake websites using their details.

I saw some loan advertisement from the text messages so i decided to call for enquiries the person name: nick, admin : Darren ( This is just fake name as well as phone number take note ) Asking how much I'm looking for i said 20k then they said need NRIC and payslip in order to check my availability And ask them need to upfront any payment they said no. So i provide the detail to them. Then they send me a agreement contract ask me to sign. And then i just anyhow sign. Then later the admin staff call me and said i need to upfront 2k in order for them to reimburse the loan And then they will revert back the 2k (Both agreement and loan approval form from kim eng with logo on it look quite real) then i told them that just minus from the 20k loan i have no money. Of cause they said can't do that. Then i mediately i realised it's a scam. So i google everything and find out all is the same tactic there use. So immediately i report police. And follow what The investigation officer told me to do. Then, the next day some other phone text and call me to threatened me. And please share with you loved ones so that they don't all on this trick again.
Met Chaoxiang ling on dating apps. He CLAIMED he is a petroleum engineer in petronas, Not married. Father died and mother in USA. Said his ex cheated on him. He texted me 3 to 4 times a day. We chatted for 2 years and but no video calls as he claims camera cannot be used in oil rig. Me asked for money when his projects got into trouble and no money dor foods. Kept asking me to transfer money and buying itune cards. Said he will commit suicide if I don't send. Said he will return to Singapore and return me my money but did not.. Once he told me he met an accident on the way to airport and send me pictures but it was all fake. His PICTUREs can be seen at Instagram Chaoxiang Ken Ling (@officialken_ling). Might have stole someone photos. He befriended other women too. Hope they are not scammed by this evil man. Karma will go after him.
I was googling for personal loan and i saw this website https://goldenscredit-sg.com (Note: Fake website) to compare different loans so i clicked into it. There was "compare Now" button so i thought it was just comparing different bank loans website. after entering name, email address, contact number, monthly income and loan amount, i clicked on "compare now". My details was submitted. few moments later, i received 2 SMSes saying that I clicked onto their google ads and asking if i need loans. however, they are accomplice. 1st guy, Lucas, said that it's ok if i do not need to loan now however i will offend other moneylenders and he is able to help me to resolve my issues. 2 guy, Mervin started to threatened me the next day as I was ignoring his messages. he started sending me photos of my house. i panicked and i looked for lucas for help. Lucas asked me to send my details to him and the other moneylenders will not harass me if i registered in his company. after registering and asking me to sign a loan contract stating from best credit sg. he started to ask me to pay for lawyer fee of $5000 to protect myself from them harassing me. he sent me a lawyer letter. next day, he asked to pay $4800 for insurance fee to insure that anything happened to me within 2 years, insurance company able to pay for my loan. next he asked me to pay another $5000 to open a joint account with his company. that's when i find it strange and i called best credit sg to verify. they said they receive many such calls and asked me report to the police. i also went to contact the law firm and the lawyer confirmed that they did not issue the contract. i went to make police report and blocked lucas. lucas got angry and starting to harass my family members.

Received a call from a woman called herself DBS staff, to inform me of an unauthorized credit card purchase in Beijing, and very kindly help me to connect to the so-called international police in Beijing. Then a man gave a call to me, the number was exactly the same as the police station number in Beijing, probably modified somehow. he asked me to cooperate with the police investigation procedures, and contacted me via WhatsApp, and command me to stay in a place where no computers are allowed, no other people's intervening. all of this took about 40 mins, and my friend realized something wrong, thankfully he helped me identify this as a scam call!! Be careful everyone.
I was looking for a personal loan and came across this website https://bestscredit-sg.com (Note: Unlicensed moneylender misusing this company’s name ) I filled in my details and few mins later I receive a message from the above mentioned hp number.

Despite blocking them, they kept messaging from different numbers. I made a police report.Editor's Note:Please note that unlicensed moneylenders can impersonate as licensed moneylenders by creating fake websites using their details.

I got tempted by a online ad on locanto with the girl offering services for 200 for 3 hours. i then Proceeded to find the girl on line and made an appointment with her. she made sure to check on line which part of singapore im staying before giving me the address to meet her. During the meet up she will first give excuses such as being late and then ask for your phone number. she will then inform you that someone else would be calling you for security purposes. next a guy called himself (chinese speaking) ah bao called saying he is from some company and then he will ask you to go to the store that's conveniently nearby and buy stored-value cards. luckily in my case the cards happened to be out of stock and hence i paid an lesser amount for the cards. next they will give more excuses to convince you to buy the cards even if it means paying more and saying that they will pay you back the extra amount later. in my case i refused since I felt something was wrong after i bought the cards. However, my lustful self decided that i can afford to lose 160 to either have a chance to have sex or to buy a lesson. so once i refused, the scammers used the line account to persuade me to download and install an app on my phone and sign up as an member saying that will give me the discount to make up for the missing 40. after i scanned the .apk file with an anti-virus app which shows that it was fine, i then installed the app. but that's when they started asking for more money saying its to ensure you are not with the police. it was then i realised i was definitely being scammed and decided to pull out from it. unfortunately the app that i installed earlier came back to bite me and i realised that they could track my location using that app and it also downloaded numbers of my contacts. the ah bao person then called again and started the threats about your family and how he will divulge what you did to your friends and family. what i did from here was to ignore the threats and brace myself in case anything he said might be true while quickly uninstalling the app from my phone. afterwards i checked and realised the app that i installed was an malware. I hope it would be fine after I uninstalled the app.

At 13:28PM on 8 March 2021 I received a phonecall with number +6594999183 that had an automated voice recording informing me that I have been unresponsive to DBS bank trying to contact me several times and instructed me to dial '3' to speak to a staff member. I proceeded to do so and was responded by a man's voice saying "Hello DBS bank.." in a very low and slurred tone. I responded with "Hello.." and before I could say anything else the call was hung up. Only then that I realized that it was an unusual circumstance and proceeded to locate a scam call hotline and made a police report.
I received a phonecall at 11.55am on 8 March. the indian man claims that he is from singtel technical department and claims that my name cannot be found in their list. i do not have any subscriptions with singtel before so i detected it as a scam which i hung up immediately.
I had a call on 5th march at 11.57 am From a Filipino sOunding man who cLaimed that he’s from DBS. He said my account has been suspended and Wanted my account number and I/C. Luckily, I was already aware of the scams Via media and was rather annoyed at how NONCHALANT this caller is using DBS banks name For scamming. I told him “ i’ll report yoU to the police. You are Scammer." He stayed on the line for a while and hung up.
I got a call at about 8:40am and picked up the call. I heard there was a robotic voice claiming that the caller was from "DBS" and that i never picked up their "calls many times" despite them never calling me in the first place. When i heard that i have to contact their "customer support", I immediately hung up. This followed by 2 more separate calls (both in different numbers, +65 9108 8199 and +65 9834 8227) in the span of 18 minutes before not receiving more of these calls. I double-checked if the phone number i picked up was a scam call and i was so glad i did not pick up the other 2 phone calls as i found out that phone numbers with the "+65" prefix could be a spoofed calls.
A woman with Indian accent called claiming she was from Singtel.said that there were 20-30 devices linked to our internet and that hackers were trying to use our internet. she wanted to guide my hubby to go through our internet system.

when i answered the call, there's this voice msg that said dbs bank tried calling me many times but i did not response so i was aske to press "3" to speak to a customer service officer. the caller told me he's from dbs bank. he ask me for my name so he can check on the purpose of the call. after checking, he told me i have an outstanding balance on one of my credit card which was under my name. I asked for the transaction details, they told me its purchasing of gold chain of abt $3k. I told him I didn't buy any gold. he was speaking in mandarin so i ask him i want to speak to an english speaking customer service officer then he say he can't transfer. So i told him I would call DBS hotline myself. then I hung up.
I received a phone call from an Indian woman claiming to be from Singtel. she said that my internet has a security problem and asked me to turn on my laptop so that she can show me how my internet was compromised. I then hung up the call.

I have received an email supposedly from Singapore post saying that they noticed a delivery on hold due to non-payment of S$2.10 last week. they requested me to make payment of S$2.10 in order to receive the delivery. I ignored it because of the suspicious email address. then I received the email from the same email address again on 25 Feb 2021. I felt that i have to alert someone about it, hence this message.

I send the 250 and he then message and send a message after due to you sending the bank needs a validation fee to send the money. I got suspicious and he send a fake OUB screenshot. The next day I send 250. A manager call me and said MAs required a fee of 300 to immediate transfer.

1) This happened to my helper. My heper got to know a man by the name of aisha muhammad from facebook. They have been chatting for 3 weeks. He has expressed interest in my helper and claimed that he wants to come to singapore to marry her. He said that he is sending gifts from London to Singapore and needs my helper to remit sgd500 to the courier company for her to receive the gifts. He claimed that he is divorced and has 2 daughters. He even had a video call once with my helper. But after much questioning from me and probing of information from the voice messages sent, the voice of the man has an accent that doesn't sound like he is from London and his command of English seems to be quite bad. My helper has shared part of my address (excluding my unit) number with him and has even told him that she works at my place and disclosed how many people are at home. 2) happened today 26 feb 21 around sgt 5pm. This was the time my helper asked me to remit her salary to another account.3) money was not lost. The only thing lost was her disclosure of part of my address to the scammer
I did some online shopping and was expecting to receive some packages. I received this email, apparently from Singpost, indicating i have not made any payment and hence will not receive my package,There was a link "pay fees of my delivery" which kind of suspicious as usually i would be asked to make payment at the counter and collect my package.I checked the address of the link and discovered that it is actually directed to "https://howlimkaf.org/" (note: phishing website, do not click). I immediately rechecked the email address and also discovered that it is "@singapost.com.sg" (fake email address) instead of "@singpost.com.sg".
I received a phone call from someone claiming to be from singtel at 1:17 pm, it sound like a indian lady speaking. she said that my home internet is unsecure and it also happen to other peolple, she offer to secure the internet access and want me to give her access to my home internet which i said no and the lady hang up. at that point of time, i was thinking it can't be someone trying to gain access by social engineering by calling me as i seldom give out my mobile number (i do know that the call could be a scam as i have taken up cyber security before in my schooling years) made me think that the called could be suspisous and calling singtel's hotline for me to confirm is it true which they ended up confirming that the call was not made by them. Beware of this scam!
I was looking for licenced moneylender in Singapore and i saw a website from credit 89 moneylender and i input my details and loan amount. The next morning i received a whatsapp message from a guy named SAM claiming that he is from credit 89. I provided him copy of last 3 months bank statement and CPF contribution statement and photos of my ic. I informed him that i wish to loan $35k. I was then informed by Sam that i am required to upfront pay admin fee of 10% which is $3.5k. He suggested that i pay whatever amount i have first to secure a loan first. I transferred him $2k to secure a $20k loan first to a POSB bank account provided by him. However, I did 2 separate transactions of $1k each to the account which he say it is incorrect as it cannot be split and the bank required me to do another transfer of $2k in a single transaction. I then transferred him another $2k. The next day he whatsapp-ed messaged me again that the bank will be transferring me $37k ($35k loan amount plus the refunded $2k which i initially transferred incorrectly). He then informed me that i am required to transfer him the remaining $1.5k admin fee which i did transferred. After which, Sam informed me that the bank will be transferring me $40k instead as the bank is only able to transfer amount ending with $5000s denomination. He even showed me a screenshot of a successful posb bank transaction of the $40k transferring to my bank account which funds will be available after 2 working days. He informed that i am required to transfer him $3k immediately if not the bank will stop the transaction. I then transferred him. I called POSB the next day but was informed that there is no pending $40k incoming to my account. Sam informed that the bank had stopped the transaction. 2 days later, Sam whatsapp message me again to inform that they have received a government lawyer that his company had been fined $5k and i need to pay upfront and refunded to me later. Subsequently i paid another $8k more as informed by his company’s manager CK Tan to make sure the loan will be successfully. I had also spoken to their boss named Kong. I realised that this is a scam when i called up the law firm and was informed that they never issued this letter before and they had also received many feedbacks from other people receiving similar letters like this from other moneylenders including credit 89. I had also called up the credit 89 main line from the list of licenced moneylender from MinLaw and was informed that they have received before feedback of a scam involving personnel posing as credit 89 staff. In total we had transferred $18.5k to this company which we have not received back or received the loan amount.Editor's note: Scammers can impersonate real moneylenders by creating websites using their names.

I received the following phishing message from "dbs bank" on 16 feb 2021. what's scary is that the message was parked under the same conversation thread from the real DBS sender. "Dear customer, your atm card temporarily has been suspended by dbs because you didn't update yet if you want to activate please call us at 31293641" i called up dbs's hotline and they confirmed that they did not send any sms to me on that day. so i'm sure this is a phishing message.Editor's note: Scammers can send messages using the ID used by legitimate organisations.

The scammer (a lady with North Indian Accent) called from +65 8659 5191 and told me that she is calling from Singtel and that my Home internet router could be been hacked by an intruder. She asked me If I was the owner of the house? I replied, "I could be." She further pressed on and asked me to confirm my address and asked me where is my home or office located? At this point in time, I already knew that this was a scam call as I do not use Singtel internet, so I replied, "I am just located behind your house." - hearing this, the called dropped the call promptly. Imagine, if the scammer got through to an unsuspecting individual? The damage could have been catastrophic. Be careful of this kind of scammer. Never provide any personal information to anyone claiming to be from any dept, orgn or company or authority.
Under Facebook jobs. personal assistant category. there is quite a few of them with different names, mostly caucasians names, with a super vague profile. Their descriptions for the job will be "Looking for a honest PA, no experienced required, $$$$." the job requires you to post apartment listings on ur facebook market place, reply to the consumers' queries &amp; direct them to the mastermind. they will then email you an invoice for the salary wired to you. However, a activation fee will be required. Now, the mastermind will get you to purchase an itunes card in order to pay that fee. It's a very common listing in facebook jobs. Not only do the job seeker get scammed, those looking for the apartments too.
He impersonated as a technician from singtel that called my parents, asked if the internet is facing any issues. Coincidently, My parents are facing connectivity issues the past 2 days and thought that he is a genuine call to fix the issue. He gave his name as eric lewis, and a case id OTT_096/218/2021 for reference. Firstly, he requested my dad's personal information like name, IC, DOB, address for verification purposes. secondly, he requested a remote access to my dad's laptop to troubleshoot via some remote access tool. Once he has the access, he started opening the chrome browser to access the login page of the banks - OCBC, citibank, posb, corpass/singpass and requested my dad to login. luckily, my dad can't recall the password correctly and failed to login. My dad found it suspicious and asked for his company contact number to verify continuing the call. That's where he refused to provide and he hung up.
She send a hi message first To my whatsapp around 7.09 pm. I received an sms Regarding a whatsapp OTP xxx-xxx. Thereafter she Whatsapp-ed and said that she sent me a six digit code by mistake and if i could give it to her since it is urgent. I didn't send it back and blocked her from my whatsapp account cos it could be a verification code to access my Whatsapp.
1. received a call from +65 6807 63312. caller claim to be from Singtel technical dept (which i never heard of before)3. caller claim his name is Robin Wilson but has an obvious Indian accent4. said there is heavy data usage on my internet server (which i challenged him this should be singtel problem and not mine)Upon challenging him on further details, he reiterated that he couldn’t reveal anything over the phone.Once I told him I would contact singtel directly, he told me it is unnecessary as he is assigned to this.He put down as soon as I called his bluff.
I just received a call of this nature, who asked if I was having patchy internet and said that they have detected other devices "piggybacking" on my internet. Punchline is - my internet service provider isn’t SINGTEL.
I was recently contacted by 64366693 who was impersonating singtel on 2nd february 2021 regarding my home's fibre broadband, stating that I was referred to as a contact person by my mother regarding this. she even stated the full name of both my mother and i during the very start of the phone call. She also mentioned that my broadband had to re-contracted before that week's Friday, otherwise it will be terminated, and requested for credit card details to proceed with the payment. when i told her i have to discuss it with my family, she mentioned that she will give me a follow-up call which thankfully did not happen after. When I got home, I checked with my mother about this, but was told that she received no such calls from Singtel and did not refer me to be contacted by Singtel at all. i then contacted singtel to check about this and was told that there was no such number (+65 64366693) registered under any of their departments. IT'S a bit scary as the scammer knew the relation of my mother and i, as well as our full names. hope everyone will be aware of such scam and am concerned of some data breach somewhere since our names and relationship was known by the scammer. additional info: tHE SPEAKER was a female, and HAD A VERY STRONG INDIAN ACCENT.
Got a call from +65 6690 5833. It’s exacTly related to this https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-15Feb2021104602AM But i wanted to add that the caller 1) builds ‘credibility’ by not outwardly asking your particulars ( typical of scammers), 2) while they tried very hard, it was obvious that they were not locals, first ‘agent’ had very thick indian accent - they will confuse you and then they handover you to their ‘chief engineer’ 3) they claim your internet is pinging multiple security issues to their system and that the blinking light in your router is indicative of that, which will make you nervous and continue With the call. They will even ask you to go to your router. 4) My experience was that they will ask you over and over again “are you the owner of the internet line?” I Got to the point where they ask me To do the ‘assoc’ in cmd prompt. But luckily tHe call got cut off. And luckily i was on edge from the very first Time And never gave any details. My aDvise/tip, and this is what i did, was to immediately call singtel and verify it myself. If you Answer the call And you spotted its suspicious, just hangup. Take note - singtel will not call you this way for security issues. If anything they would fix it on their end. And if you get locked out due to security issues, sIngtel wont call you. At most, they will put a note in your profile about any pertinent issues. The scammer was pretty ballsy and tried calling me as i was speaking to a technical support from singtel.
I made a transfer with DBS i-banking and received a call from someone impersonating dbs within one minute. I felt like it was related to my dbs sms alert. I have set up an sms alert to be notified for every transfer above 1000 sgd. it was as if the scammer has received my alert. he was aware of me having made a transaction and was inquiring if I had any other bank accounts in Singapore. he hung up the phone when i asked for his name. I checked for sim swap scam and it says that my phone should have lost the network which it had not. how can someone get hold of SMS notification sent by DBS? Is it a pure coincidence?
Number called me and told me he was from singtel. he told me that singtel has detected a lot of weird activity on my internet the past few days(which is not wrong but always self rectifiable). he went through a long process of describing to me the ctrl key by spelling it out and the windows key next to it to press win+R. eventually led me to open the command bar and key in assoc by which time i had no more time to entertain him and just hung up at that point in time. ASSOC is a command that displays the program and/or functionality ASSOCiated with a specific file type. This particular CLSID is frequently misrepresented by scammers as being a unique identifier of the victim’s system and/or a license ID for the Windows operating system. In fact, a CLSID is an identifier that is unique not to a particular PC, but to a COM class object, which means that it will be the same on any Windows system where that object can be found. In other words, there are many millions of Windows computers where running the ASSOC command will show exactly the same text somewhere in its display. It does not represent a unique ID string for either the PC or for a specific installation of Windows. TLDR; its gonna end up with him convincing you to install teamviewer or something to let his friend gain access to your pc. do not do this. only let people you trust access your pc. remember, singtel is not gonna call you from a mobile phone number.
I saw a loan company from a website call Sg Credi? and I submittd an application. The person called Bernard Yeap replied. He told me about the process. From the application he mentioned that i need to pay him 1. $700.00 for 1 month deposit which uob required and $2500.00 for his administration fee which mas required. So i transfer him. I signed a contract with him. Then he said he transer by tomorrow the $25k that i asked for. Next day he said they transacte wrongly at $50k but cannot release the money because i need to pay another $700.00. So i asked them. They are sure once i pay $700 they will send over. After 3rd transfer, they send email using MAS said i need to pay another $5000.00 which i feel.is not right. I argue with bernard. He asked me go MAS and they won’t transfer until paid another $5000.00. From here, I realised that it was a scam that was planned to let me hook on. I checked on register of money lender, they supposed not to collect any fee from borrower. They can only deduct from the loan. Please beware of unlicensed moneylenders!
I get to know this guy through one of the dating apps, coffee meet begal in jul’2020. At first he is very friendly and i thought we can be friends, and might develop further. According to him, he is holding a managerial position in bank of china which is in hong kong. We chatted everyday and night via whatapps. Everything went well and few months later he confessed to me and said that I was the one that he was looking for all this while. I am a bit shocked as it was quite tough for me to be in relationship again but cos of those sweet words it was difficult to reject at times. I took two months to accept him and the story comes. One early morning he texted me to tell me that his dad in china is at critical condition which needs my financial assistance as his account was freezed. I asked him the reasons of frozen account and he says it was due to contract with the client that's why the account was frozen. He promised me he will return money to me once his account is active. Due to i am kind hearted person hence i agreed to transfer him money. He requested me to provide my ic i did ask him why and he told me cos he needs to withdraw money then i was like ok. Days later he requested me to transfer money and many times all the accounts i transferred is different account. Until one day police called me asks me why i transferred huge amount to one account then i wake up and feel something is wrong. I quickly lodged police report and now pending investigations. All i can say here is don't ever transer money to someone you have never met.

They asked for my age and asked me to stay near an authorised device. I said that i am not near that network now and they terminated the call thereafter.

He want some verification of my acct, once i heard singtel i know its scam as I'm not a singtel subscriber then when he mention he want verification i hang up as i dont know if the call is chargeable and seemed he want to make it longer. Talking explaining repeating that he is from singtel technical dept. As i know there are scam that will charge you the call so they will keep you on hold in the line as much as possible so they can charge more. So better don't say anything.
I reCeived an Email asking about The room Rental details and AVAILABILITY. After i forward My whatsapp for communication, she wrote me the email with tan Mui Joo Ic. Great reading from you again. I would like to secure the bedroom. I love a clean and peaceful environment. I will be coming down on the 19th of February and i will be staying for more than a year with you as long as we are all happy living together with each other. I will suggest transferring my rent and utilities over to you to secure the room prior to my coming because it is quite hard for me to get down there and start looking for a room to rent. If you have a PayPal account it would be so easy and safe for us because i have not been using my online access for so long and i will have to get to the bank before i can make a transfer but unfortunately i work till late and the banking hall closes before i finish at work. All you need is to set up a PayPal account if you don't have one just log into www.paypal.com and set up an account it doesn't take much time to set up and get back to me with your PayPal email address and also your PayPal name for me to transfer the fund over to you. Do also note that I have attached a copy of my IC for you. I will wait to read back from you. Take good care and have a great time over there. —- I search and find scammers with simiLar contents and i Ignored the email. Would like all to note in case “she” tried to scam others.

On 1st Feb, 2021, A lady by the name of CHEN ZHIHONG responded to my condo for rental ad in Gumtree. She told me to contact her at her gmail address = zhi81788@gmail.com. I replied her asking for her resident status, occupation, duration of stay, move in date &amp; budget. I also gave her my whatsapp number which was a mistake as i started receiving a DBS scam call after that. She replied saying she is 38 yrs old, A Singapore PR, single lady, non-smoking, working as a chef in a cruise ship. She was AT sea at that moment and will rent my condo apartment when she returns to Singapore. She asked me to calculate the total cost of 6 months rental and deposit, and attached a blue Singapore IC of CHEN ZHIHONG with NRIC #: S8080???H, date of birth: 24-01-1982, SEX: F, COUNTRY of birth: China in her email. I replied her with my ad link address in gumtree to show her the photos of my apartment as she requested. her next email reply was asking me to send her my paypal information such as name, paypal email and phone number so she can make a payment to me. She also gave me her whatsApp#: +63 956 319 1394, which is a Phillipines international code. That made me very suspicious, so i decided to write my story in this website. I decided to block the gmail address and stop all communication with this scammer.
I am close to 30 with no DATING experience. Due to the stress FROM family and friends, I DECIDED to try dating app. Then I met this guy on coffee meets bagel app. He claimed that he is a Taiwanese and he is doing food catering business with his friends in kuala Lumpur. He is gentle, mature, hardworking and always shows his concerns on me. I thought it may be a return after praying in the Yuelao temple. So I accepted his confession. After that he told me that his business was not good due to covid. So he used part of his fund to do investment. He told me that he studied finance in school and all the investment he did were safe after his calculation and analysis. So he asked me to follow him. I added the customer service and asked to deposit to a local bank acc. I did so as I felt safe when seeing a local bank acc instead of overseas acc. (So please do not share your bank acc to others to do any part time jobs. You are helping the scammers to cheat the real victims like me) In the end, of course I am not able to withdrawal my money back. He used 5 months time to win over my trust and cheated all my savings. I thought it was true love but what he truly loves is my money. It really hurts.
I came across this part time job listing on carousell Offering a part time position to handle Send some mails To the addresses he will provide. He even asked if i was staying near the post office. Why he was not able to send the parcels himself is due to him being stuck in new york. He Claims to be an architect there and will only be back in singapore by july 2021. He asked for my ic and bank account details for verification. Within a few hours, he mentioned that I was selected for the job. So he transferred $300 to my bank account and asked me to buy bitcoins so that he will be able to buy bAgs. He instructed me to download the Zengo app and purchase bitcoins there. After buying the bitcoins, he asked me to send it to the wallet address which he specified. Next day, he transferred another $150 and asked to do the same too. Few days later, I was a bit suspicious so i went down to make a police report. And i was informed that there was already a report against me for that bank account which was used hence it was frozen. I am stressed beyond believe. Now, I'm just waiting for the officer to call me down to take my statement. I Feel so helpless and I honestly Thought that it was a real part time job. My entire family has never had a criminal record once and its stressing me so much to think that i could be sentenced. One things for sure, I will never use Carousell to search for jobs. Carousell needs to have a better system for jobs listing, despite my efforts to report the user, it wasn’t taken down as the user did not violate any terms so there are more people who are looking at the same exact job posting that I saw and applied and Could potentially fall for this.
On 7th Jan, i was applying a loan from this Lending Be? website (fake website) at 7am. Then around 10am this guy name Melvin contacted me through Whatsapp to ask if I was applying for loan amount of 3k. As i thought it was the staff from the lending company, I passed him my personal information ( NRIC front and back ), my bank account and my Next of kin contact which is my brother. later in the afternoon around 12 plus, i call lending bee company directly to ask if there's any staff by the name of Melvin and the staff told me nope. immediately i deleted all the personal information in the whatsapps. the next day, this Melvin told me that already transfer me the money of $400. so i told him I didn't want the loan already but he say must return $600 if I wanted to cancel the request. That very night, I made a police report and the IO say I had encounter a illegal moneylender. the IO told me to return him the actual amount he transferred to me and showed him the receipt. After 2 separate payment of $200 each weekly, I blocked his number and change new number too. i thought everything will be gone by then but the guy started to call my brother and harassed him instead, so i went down to lodge another report but the officer told me to ask my brother lodge himself since he's the one being harassed. I resorted to installing CCTV at my house, I hope to warn all to not apply for loans without checking the details of moneylender. Don't apply your loan via Whatsapp, as you never know what is going to happen next.Editor's note: Unlicensed moneylenders or loan scammer will use licensed moneylender's details to cheat, including creating a fake website.

@trustdeals4_you - this person listed a bunch of apple products at a super low price. Like, he listed the M1 Macbook air for $500 on shopee. He encourages people to contact him on telegram (same username, with the firstname "bin"). Which i did, and he asked for my full name and address first. When I asked him if pickup was available and where his shop was, he listed regentville, 6 hougang street 9x, which I found out later is a bookkeeping company. Unfortunately, I had given him my details but quickly deleted the message, not sure if it was recorded or not. A few hours later, his shopee account was banned.
The caller claimed to be from Singtel, wanting to speak about my internet usage. I do not have a Singtel account, when challenged on this she claimed that the call was in relation to my internet usage and due to the fact that Singtel provides all underlying internet infrastructure in Singapore. I ended the call after two minutes.
Someone claiming that he's from starhub, and my internet has been accessed several times by outsiders and unknown users. He is seeking to look into my laptop (unsure how, as i hang up immediately). I re-confirmed with the starhub official team, and this number is verified as a scam (as starhub does not require you to access laptop for any particular reasons). Plus, i do not have a Starhub internet.
An Indian guy called me on whatsapp, has a very strong indian accent when speaking in english. he said he was calling from DBS bank. i just hanged up and reported the number on whatsapp. just hope people can take note of weird numbers calling their mobile.
Received a call from a lady with a heavy Indian accent telling me that my internet connection has been hacked by over a hundred users. I asked how she got my contact she said because I’m a singtel customer. I said I am not. And she immediately hung up. Clearly a scam. Be vigilant. Don't be scammed!

Sometime in November 2020, I met this girl on an online dating app and after chatting for a few days she introduced me to an investment app called 五洲国际. She says she has used this app to earn money and she wanted to help me to earn some money. Initially the first few days we earned a few hundred. She claimed that by putting in more money, the returns will be higher. She also introduced one of her friend from china to the app and we ended up losing all the money and she blamed it all on her friend instead. I also found out afterwards that there is no way to withdraw the money from the app. That is when I realised that i have been scammed but it was already too late. There were also attempts to reach her at her 'workplace' but there was not such person working there. Please do not ever put any money into this app or else you will not be able to get your money back.
Caller claimed to be from "Singtel" and informed me that my internet connection and router had a security breach. I stopped him at that point because I knew it was a scam. I'm not a Singtel user.
He add me up on Instagram and called himself Calvin who works as us classified military marine engineer. Pours loving words everyday without fail till I fall for it. Never video call before but he did called me after I said that our relationship going nowhere. It's been going on for months and he even mentioned that he wants to marry ME coz I was sent by God. Then on the 22nd Jan, he told me that he was going offshore and will be sending me gifts with 30k in it. It was SURREAL. On the day that I was suppose to receive the gift, I received a WhatsApp message stating that I need to pay sgd3500 for the overweight of a 35kg parcel. I became suspicious. Then I told Calvin. And he said he doesn't know about it and asked me to make the payment first. And I can take back my money when I received the parcel. I was being reluctant coz the bank details are all personal. My heart urged me to look up in the internet and I found the same WhatsApp number ( +65 8426 939?] with the almost similar story like mine. Thank God that my heart says don't go any further. Lesson learnt. Never fall for someone who claims that he FALLs for you in an INSTANT and never even once make a video CALL.. He should be caught and PAY the price for cheating vulnerable WOMEN's money.
Met on "Happn" (a social dating app), decided to converse on whatsapp thereafter. Introduced himself as "micheal lee", private jet pilot based in uk, also happens to be a real estate agent. Only child of late parents, born and raised in the UK (but English is worse than mine). Dad’s a Korean and Mom’s a S’porean/Indon. In our conversations, he said wanted to relocate to Indonesia. After that said may consider Singapore instead because it’s a safer place. One day suddenly said he saw some beautiful things and bought them for me, will mail &amp; requested for my address. Thinking twice, decided to give my old house address (i just moved). Next day said it was mailed &amp; provided a tracking number with the courier service website to track parcel - grant express services (https://www.grantexpressservices.com/). I input the tracking number and it said the parcel will arrive in Singapore next day. Found it odd cos air freight from UK to Singapore couldn't be that fast!! He also mentioned he already paid for international courier charges but didn't clear "local custom charge" which i may need to pay. Found this rather odd too. Next day, I received a Whatsapp text from this local number (+65 84269398) indicating I had to pay 3500sgd for custom clearance and overweight charges. I asked "Micheal" about it, he told me not to worry as he placed enough cash inside to reimburse me (20,000 usd). I could take what i needed and keep the rest for him till he comes to Singapore. Qns: #1. I barely knew him, why send me USD$20,000. He said he has a lot of money from his job and inheritance from his parents. #2. He's supposed to be in London, why in US dollars and not pounds? #3. I googled legit courier services in uk &amp; found the most expensive service was 200gbp for the same size/weight. I called back the sg number using landline, but "this singtel number is not in use”. Red flag. I whatsapp-called the courier guy, he sounded like a black whose English was probably his 3rd language. Told him to give me the bank account number, i’ll do a bank transfer. He said no bank transfer because it takes 3 days to clear, must be done via atm cash deposit. He sent acct details to me, it was a DBS account with a Malay female name. And finally, #4. Why is it a personal bank account instead of a business one? Then i knew it’s quite an elaborate scam they're running. Pity that I didn’t screenshot the bank account details and name (the text was subsequently deleted by the guy when i said i will report to the authorities). Told "Micheal" that if he wanted to cheat me of $3500, he's bumped into the wrong person. He suddenly turned nasty and said i was falsely accusing him, called me stingy for not wanting to pay $3500. Before I foiled his plans, he was pressuring me very hard to make the payment, and I knew something was wrong.
Received text message from ken lim "Claim he from DBS bank" ask me to transfer money to ap credit under ocbc account of $210 ( for gst govt) Therefore i keyed in wrong remark told me to pay penalty of $300. AFTER THAT ASK ME AGAIN TO PAY ANOTHER $500 CLAIMED THAT I WILL GET MY LOAN ASAP.
An Indian man called my mobile on 11jan21 2.04pm claiming to be from Singtel. He told me my router had too many devices (more than 35) connected to it and had high data usage. He offered to check if my router had been hacked. He asked about my router information but i didn't fall into his trap cause I'm not a Singtel subscriber. I hung up after i told him i will check with my teleco.
Someone called me and claimed that he was from singtel and i overheard a person speaking with him in Tamil. Caller asked him whether is my connection today good then he did not reply and i hung up.
I was a victim of online fraud. This month, I ordered 3 sets of branded grinder(Total $72) from Snoufu?(mall.snoufu?.com &lt;http://mall.snoufu?.com/&gt; ) but got 3 plain steel bowls.This company is so daring that despite my order cancellation before even they confirmed any shipment, they still did not accept my cancellation request and keep sending me shipment details. After 2 weeks of follow up on delivery, I got 3 steel bowls worth $3 . Beware of hidden traps when shopping online and please do your research first before carrying out any transactions with anyone or company!
Just receive a Telco (machine VOICE) voice line call in SAYS MY SINGTEL NO. WIL EXPIRE IN 2 HOURS ASK ME TO PRESS 5. Knowing it was a scam, I hung up.

I saw a ps5 selling on shopee and i contacted the person through whatsapp. The price was not even considered low, it was just $30-40 cheaper than retail price. It has all these info on a website, Instagram etc. so I thought it was quite legit. But when I transferred a $700 bank transfer to their uob bank account, they told me i have to pay for the insurance, vat, gst fee at a separate transfer of $320 and $410. They again asked for $510 shipping delivery insurance which all will be refunded after package is received. as the amount is too high, i did not comply and asked for a full refund which in the end no reply from the seller.

I get to know this guy from Cmb. We chatted in WhatsApp for around 3 weeks. Even though we never meet out but he confessed his love for me. I pushed him to meet out( he is in singapore) but he will always use his tight work schedule as an excuse. By the 3rd week of chatting, on one particular night he started to ask me to invest in this online investment link to earn some extra money. I REJECTed him and he was angry about it. He refused to continue to chat with me as he felt that there was no trust between us. My advice is 1) a guy that really has an interest in you ,will make an effort to meet you out 2) do not Invest in anything if you have not meet out the guy even though he claims he love you (high chance he is a scammer)
I received an unexpected phone call informing me that I have subscribed to a credit card on sep 25 and owe the bank money. He spoke only mandarin.

Told him off as I declined his offer of loan. I managed to transfer back that $400(300 plus interest of $100) As I thought the problem was solved but little did i know that he used my ic for borrowing money from other loansharks.

I was looking for a loan, made a few applications online. Someone FROM "G? credit" contacted me direct on whatsapp, but not the real G? Credit. They lied about the Loan terms to get a signature on the doc and then started threatening the cancellation fee when I didn't go ahead (as they wanted up front fees paid - so obviously a scam) and then I said I would report to police and they sent many threatening whatsapp using various numbers as I blocked each number.

Got to know this guy through cmb and thereafter we moved on to whatsapp. Eventually he start to introduce an investment app that you've to install via a 3rd party link which it doesn't look legit. Hence i kept decline his offer to "earn extra pocket money".However, during the conversation, there are a couple of loopholes that you will know he is a scammer.List of examples:1. Saying he is a taiwanese but having a china accent and holding on to a hongkong line. 2. Telling you about his occupation (doctor or lawyer), but you're unable to google him.3. During this pandemic period, he is in singapore for work purpose and staying at mbs, when mbs is no longer a shn hotel. Hence to everyone, be observant when talking to someone that we just know from social media.

I got to know this girl from dating app. Then she started telling me to join her in this investment app which we need to put in money to invest. Soon, the app said we can put in more money to earn more returns and I did. When i need to withdraw they said the amount is too big and MAS needed me to top up more money in order to release the funds and if i didn't, I would incur charges. Then, I realized that I got scammed. She claimed to be from China, living in Sentosa now with her ailing mother taking care of her and not working. Beware!

Please share with your love one - it all started when i receive a text message with a link attached to it as such i click on it and it direct to a whatapps page where i have to chat with a guy name Darrel tan, he will pretend as a licensed moneylender in singapore and offer attractive loan and requested me to transfer sgd500 to open an account and request me to transfer more and more when i decided not to loan or give in anymore, the second guy name card will appear and ask whether you need a loan - they will drop you a whatapps msg proving that they have transfer to your account but that was not my account at all and they will also edit a print screen whereby they already transfer to your account - all this is fake! When i rejected they started to threaten and harassed me.this is a loan scams.in a licensed moneylender is not allowed to make any cold calls or send unsolicited messages. As i can't prevent a scam to happen but i hope my story will prevent the next victim in getting scams.

Posted an advertisement for room Rental online and received an email from yeo siew lian, A SINGAPOREAN WORKING IN TURKEY WHO WILL BE COMING BACK TO SINGAPORE ON JANUARY 5TH AND needed a room. ————- Hello, Great reading from you again. I have seen the pictures and I am sure that is exactly how the room is as it is in the pictures. I would like to secure the bedroom. I love a clean and peaceful environment. I will be coming down on the 5th of January and I will be staying for more than a year with you as long as we are all happy living together with each other. I will suggest transferring my rent and utilities over to you to secure the room prior to my coming because it is quite hard for me to get down there and start looking for a room to rent. If you have a PayPal account it would be so easy and safe for us because i have not been using my online access for so long and i will have to get to the bank before i can make a transfer but unfortunately i work till late and the banking hall closes before i finish at work. All you need is to set up a PayPal account if you don't have one just log into www.paypal.com and set up an account it doesn't take much time to set up and get back to me with your PayPal email address and also your PayPal name for me to transfer the fund over to you. Do also note that I have attached a copy of my IC for you. I will wait to read back from you. Take good care and have a great time over there. Regards Yeo

我在网上找到了借贷公司，我在他们的网站上填写了在线表格。过了不久他称自己是在Credit 8?打来的。他们与我联系讨论贷款。但是，我发现他们具有很强的马来西亚口音。 我说我要借2万，借贷人就说帮我安排，资料都发了过去给他，过了不久那人就打回来说我可以贷款，但是我需要先付10％的压低钱，他说这是MAS规定的，我听了有一点点奇怪但是又说要他弄好合约给我看，看完了我把合约签了发回去，于是我就准备过账给他。等了几个小时他发户口号码来了，我就过账给他，但是很幸运的就是一直过不到，系统提示户口无效。我感到不对劲了，就直接GOOGLE找，刚好找到这个网站，点了一个新案例是跟我同一间公司的。我就知道受骗了。 在这里提醒大家小心这类型的欺骗案。

i just wanted to share with all the ladies out there who are on online dating, in order to stop scam and stop losing your money as well as your emotional wellbeing. I was matched with this guy in cmb (coffee meets bagel). he asked to move chat to whatsapp, but i asked for telegram instead so he won't know my number. he claimed to be a korean, lives in florida. his father died when he was young and mother is living in busan with relative. he would text every morning and evening. he is gemologist, who deals with different kind of precious stone and he said his life is comfortable. there are already a lot of red flags here. i asked him why he put his location as singapore when he is physically not here, he said because he likes singaporean. i confronted him, why would he dates someone thousands miles away and being so concern about me (always asked about my wellbeing in chat) when we haven't even met in person. he said distance is not a problem, we can know each other through chat as you will never know where your soulmate is. i already knew he is a scammer, i just want to waste his time and teach him a lesson. nothing is lost here and i also checked in cmb, he has been flagged by cmb and no longer there, but this kind of people can just create more and more fake profiles online. please ladies, stop chatting with someone you know from online and only wants to date virtually, you should only date someone who can meet you in person.

Matched with Fang William, 37 years old 170cm thru Paktor app in Sep 2020. His LINE ID as fang_william. Claimed to be staying in Dallas Texas USA, born of Korean and Taiwanese mixed parentage. Parents had passed on and with NO siblings. Had a 4 year old son named Billy. Wife passed on during childbirth. Switched to chat on LINE app on the same day we chatted on Paktor. Voice call on that same day via LINE to chat. Speaks English and no trace of Chinese nor Korean accent at all in his speech, more like a Caucasian accent. His occupation is a Construction Engineer in the Telecommunications industry. Started addressing me "Sugar", "Honey", "Baby", "Dear" Very reluctant to do video call (red flag). Texted every day without fail almost at the same timing, every morning and night. One month into the chat, said we were together for a month now. Days later, said he was bidding for a contract and will need to fly out to Germany for 3 weeks to complete the project. Got the project in just 2 days, competing with 3 other individuals and got it due to his past good works with the client. At this juncture, I had discovered that he’s using fake profile pics and the pics he sent were all extracted from IG. The real person behind those pics is a successful good looking Korean man residing in Korea. Flew to Germany on 04 Nov 2020. Followed the timing in Germany to send his texts promptly. Stayed in a hotel in Germany and no lockdown in Germany. There’s no truth in his words. 1 week in Germany was I was asked to transfer monies of EURO 1500 to him as his card was blocked and insufficient cash on hand to buy a material in Germany. No monies was lost at my end. Ladies, be extra cautious when you come across scammers through dating apps. Do a Google image reverse search and pay attention to the details on their given pics to pick up clues to search for more information on the web regarding that person. Bank Details to transfer the monies: Name: theophilus Marfo Bank name: Sparkasse bank Destination of bank transfer: Germany

I was told i had a DBS credit card that was applied on the 20th August 2020, via online through DBS Beijing's branch in china. I was also informed I have an outstanding debt of $3900 that i have yet to make payment to it. They gave me the details of the 'credit card' number as well as the purchase details, which was a gold necklace brought from a mall in Beijing.I told them i did not apply such a card, and it is impossible for me to make such a purchase because of covid pandemic. After which they double confirmed with me a few times whether did I apply the card or not. I insisted i did and after which, they suggested to me to file a report to Beijing police and DBS branch in Beijing. I agreed and they transferred me the line. That was the first indicator that triggered my suspicionI had a long talk with the 'police at china' mainly is revolving on the whole issue, which i have trouble understanding what they were saying. After which they suggested to file a recorded report via Whatsapp, so as to better facilitate the investigation at the 'DBS branch at Beijiing'. This triggered my suspicion the second time that this might be a scam. Everything didn’t add up for me at all. Throughout the whole incident it was converse in Mandarin. I gave them my contact number and they claimed that they will call me later via Whastapp to do the recorded police report. Shortly after, I called the DBS customer service afterwards to double clarify on this overseas credit card issue, which they told me it’s a scam. Please do not provide any requested details to callers who call you unexpectedly and always, always verify the caller’s identity.

I met this guy name Lee wang in Instagram. I Chatted with him for like a day and asked for my number for whatsapp. He looked like a gentleman and DECENT. Pictures of him did not look fake at all. He claimed to be an American-born SINGaporean living in California. We messaged every day, and he was caring, sweet and sincere. And I thought it might be a good guy. Talking for about a week and he said he had this contract which he had been pursuing for a long time and was asked to go for an interview the next day. And asked to wish and pray FOR HIM and would give me a surprise if he got his contract. Next day, he said that he had been awarded for the contract and he was very happy and did shopping for himself and things he needed for the contract and also took the opportunity to shop for me and would send me before he went for his contract work for 2months offshore in mexico. He asked for my full name and address. Since I was hesitant on how pricey the gifts was, I didn't give him my real name nor my address. He sent me the pictures of the gifts AND i was shocked. He said that he bought a MAC laptop, Chanel bag, perfumes and others. He was asked for my name and address persistently and he said it was his way of showing his appreciation to me.

Pls be alert and do your investigations like reverse image search on various platforms (google might not show up results), look into the details of pictures they send over, and ask them where it was taken. don't be afraid to ask them more questions than for them to ask you (do not reveal too much of yourself until you are sure).

I would like to share my story so that pple is aware of such scams, also since there is a number she is using, i would hope you can share the number out to the rest to warn them and also to the police. 1) the lady claims she is from Singtel tech dept called me via my mobile saying my internet is being hacked by people from other places 2) this morning at about 9.30am (5 nov 2020) 3) nothing was lost as I found the reason she gave didn't make sense.
Someone called pretending to be a Singtel technician claiming that my internet connection was compromised by overseas IP addresses. she asked how many lights were there on the router, how many devices were connected and provided singtel address and employee id as "verification" when she asked if I'm the owner and i said no, she then said she will have to check with her senior technician before calling me back. i told her i don't use Singtel. she said "i know, you use Starhub" and proceeded to hang up.
It started off with a friend request on facebook, switched to whatsapp:1) to gain access to your phone number.2) to make you trust them as they show you their number 3) its free of charge (especially for oversea scammers)4) they now know which country you live in. He claims he is a widow, i will put as many of his fake facebook profiles and articles i find about this scammer down below.He claims he is a pilot flying for china airlines. Lives in america, dallas and has a daughter.First started of with loving messages. Messages such as ‘you are my only love’, ‘honey, you know i love you’ and ‘yoh are the love of my life’, speaking as though you guys are married and are in a long-distanced relationship.He will avoid video calls or sending any videos in general. However! He will send you photos of himself whichA) look sketchy and photoshopped (+old)B) these photos can be easily accessed online and have been used many times on different dating apps.He will say he just landed and sends a picture with another pilot, but that picture had been from many years before....He will then ask for thr real stuff. Money. Starting with the parcel. On this website i found an article which had the name alex liwei wong and talks about the parcel scam in more detail. Just search ‘internet love scam alex liwei wong’. Basically saying there’s money in parcel, but later needing you to pay the tax. The company sent was fake (denmontcourier.com) and he would send you a receipt with non of his details (except phone number he used to scam) and would’ve gained full access to your address, name and phone number.It will slowly he would start asking for money by saying how urgent he needs the cash. Trust me, if he was rich enough, he doesn’t need money. After finding out his online scam, i confronted him and he apologised saying that it was identity theft and he reported this many times. It is not normal for your face to be everywhere, known as the scammer. If it’s true, he should contact the police. I suggest if you have the same situation, confront him if needed and delete + block him. Do not fall for his trap about your future.Scammer details:Name: alex hongwei wong (goes by many names such as william choong)Number: +12082168157Other:-works at china airlines-from america, dallas, texas -chinese ethnicity, but only speaks english

This friendly Hong Kong guy approached me on a friendship website in august 2020 and tempted me how much he won in investing in usdt cryptocurrency. He came from rich family and came to Singapore to set up a company. He lured me into setting up an investment account with name and email and small amount of money. I credited small sum of money into the account via an investment officer in China. I profited from investment in beginning but made a lost later. He told me I need to invest more and he would help me earn the loss. I profited but lost again second time. Third time he asked me to put in some money together with him and he would help me to earn back .the profit would all go to me while he would bear the losses. This round we made profit but again last minute the currency plunged. He asked me to help him clear his debt else he would pass my contact to the investment company to chase after me. I realised it is a scam and blocked his messages.

i cross path with this guy through an app, okcupid, we subsequently exchanged numbers and started communicating through whatsapp. he had introduced himself as a hong kong resident residing in singapore with his relatives and had plans of expanding his hotel business in singapore. after chatting with him for 1-2months, he understand that i had intention of switching jobs and started sharing with me a chinese investment app, 五洲国际 which allows you to earn quick cash overnight. initially, i had agreed to join him by making small investments and managed to win few thousands in a night. subsequently, he would persuade you to pump in more money into the app to increase the winnings. he had then lead you to make larger bettings and eventually lose all the money you had pump into the app initially. after being suspicious of his actions, i decided to share the story and happened to see another victim sharing a similar story. i had then recalled him saying that i am the only person that he was talking to and he had deleted the app long ago, therefore, i realised i have been duped all these while. please do not continue any conversations with guys that persuade you to join them in any investing activities as any gains you made initially will result to a greater loss of personal savings eventually.
Beware of MOH scam call ! A call from this number +6567244789 was received at 1:07pm 2 Nov 2020. The phone call starts with an automated voice speaking in English. It talks about I have a pending document to collect from MOH. The voice said "please press 2 for Customer Service" Then the same lines were repeated in Chinese. I pressed 2 to continue &amp; to see how far this scam will go. Immediately the call connected to a young, male, Mandarin-speaking with a polished and soothing voice. The conversation goes like this (I have a rough understanding of Mandarin): "Customer Service Rep" in Mandarin: How may I help you? My replies in English: may I know what this call is about? "Rep" in Mandarin: Why did you press this button ? (something along that line) English: May I speak to someone who can speak in English? "Rep" : Immediately disconnects the call.
I found a moneylender - Credit 89 - online. I filled in the online form on their website. They got in touch with me to discuss the loan. However, they had a very strong Malaysian accent and I had a tough timing understanding them. I asked for a contract. The contract states that I need 10% admin charge so I did not comply and they changed it to deduct from my loan quantum. So i signed after they promised. However i did not receive any money and they called me the day after saying that I would need to pay 2 months of installments. I declined and said i wont loan the money. They came up with another story sayinG it is processinG and i will be charged $1000 for holding charges each day. But if i pay the installMents, they will send Me money and i can return so there is no Additional charges. So i complied but to receive a cancellation fee of 15% and said they will send me lawyer letter. That is when i called the police and Reported. The moral of the story is to never sign anytHing online without physically being there and to decline any requests for money. Also never send your details to them as they will use the details against you. Editor's note: Note that licensed moneylenders are NOT allowed to approve loans remotely. Please get in touch with them through the contact details found here: https://rom.mlaw.gov.sg/files/ML%20Lists/ML%20List%20as%20at%20011020.pdf
The phone call starts with an automated voice speaking in English first then Chinese. It talks about I have an important piece of document still with DBS that you didn't collect/see/notice. After that, you press a number and they connect you to the 'customer service officer'. They will then ask you for your name to check your information in the system, and tell you that you have a bill that you have yet to pay or a transaction from your credit card that isn't made by you. After that they'll ask for personal details.
I was contacted by a friend's friend SAYING he wants to buy bitcoin. He transferred money to my bank account and I'd buy bitcoin and send to him. After 2-3 days, my bank account was frozen and I panicked so I called the bank and made a police report. I'm living in anxiety every single day since then. So please, do not use your bank account for other purpose, Including 'helping' people, just use it for your personal use.
I received a robocall from "DBS" that informed me that the bank tried to get in touch with me several times in regard to my personal account with DBS. The message was in Mandarin. I was asked to press '3' to speak with an agent. As DBS does not refer their service providers as agent and would not use a robocall to call their customers. Hope by sharing this experience, it will help warn others of this scam.

I met many scammers on dating apps. I just want to share Ways Of identifying them: - Keep asking questions. A genuine person Who is serious abt a relationship shoulD not find you offensive unless the qns are really too private. The more you ask, It will be harder for them to keep a story straight all the time. - chat oN local matters to see if the person is really local as cLaimed. - Validate provided info. Such as company naMe, person thru facebook, Linkedin Etc. - if the person only replies within a specific time zone, it might be time zone diFf. And a scammer UsuallY operates outside SG. - reQuest for photos at wHere They have been and requests for photos With specified posts like cLapping hands - request for meetup after a few meaningful conversations. If they do not agree and keep delaying, this is the red flag - Why expose yourself to UNCERTAINTIES and long distance relationships? Say "No" to other nationalities, foreign numbers, line, telegram and wechat. - do not get swayed by compliments and sweet nothings. A person without knowing you in person would not be calling you honey, darling, you are so pretty, i wish i met you earlier, i mIss you, if we were to get married one day..:. Etc. Scammers are manipulative. They tell you what you want to hear. - never give out email address, credit card Info or go into unknown websites Most importantly, protect yourself. It is not about being negative or distrustful. We believe that there is true love thru dating apps and that is why we choose wisely. Never get swayed if someone discredit you or label you as not loving when you don't want to help them as such because a geuine and serious and responsible person wIll stand in your shoes to think for you.
I received an SMS claiming to be from "DBS" Bank. However, the sender included a mobile phone number as the contact point to request for the loan and to direct all enquiries to. I immediately knew that it was not genuinely an SMS sent from DBS Bank Singapore. Body of the message: "&lt;DBS&gt; Installment Loan 3.8% P.A SGD 20,000=600x36 Months SGD 100,000=1,900x60 Months 83080157 https://wa.me/6583080157"
Call from scammer claiming to be from Singtel. caller id was +61 4657 20226. She claimed that there was a problem with "my network". I am not with Singtel. She hung up when I asked why Singtel has Call Centre staff in Australia.
I met this Taiwanese guy through online social app in september 2020. Thereafter, we moved to Line app and chatted for more than a week. He claimed to own a business in Singapore, has EP status and stayed at park infinia at novena. He called me every night via LINE app. Then, he started introduced me the lottery website where he earns extra income through his wisely planning and loophole of the website. Firstly, he lets me try to use his account to play and thereafter he asked me to cReate one for myself. Few times later, the account was locked and requested for more funds to transfer In order to withdrawal the money. He said he sold his house, borrowed from friends, bank and personal loan lenders to help me even though i have to transfer some myself, so i trusted him and do so. Then, subsequently I saw that some of his pictures were being used in same online social app so i texted him and told him. He told me they were being used by loansharks. Then a day later, he disappeared. His facebook is 蒋云清 and instagram is eric520550. I saw his line post have some friends added him, noted some are Singapore residents, i hope they are not be next victim.
I received an unknown phone call. Caller pretended to be from MOH(&lt;inistry of Health) and telling me to call them back as i have to collect something from them. This is clearly a scam call as I have no dealings or ongoing conversations with MOH!
I received a call in viber using this number +65 96733333. upon answering the buy on the line said they are from DBS bank and they found that my account has not updated the biometrics yet. I knew it's a scam call but i just wanted to answer the call to see on how they execute the scam. Later they asked for my mobile number and sent me an otp through sms (under the number of +1 831-231-2777). Although i received the OTP, i didnt give it to them coz i have no idea if they can use that to access my phone. Please beware of such scams and NEVER release OTPs of any accounts to anyone.Editor's Note: We do not encourage the public to interact with the scammers. End such phone calls immediately.
I met a guy named lucas chan who claimed that he's a korean but was born and raised in us in the app meef and he told me to have chat in whats app. That time i don't have anything to do so i said okay lets chat there and we got to know each other. That's what i thought. Few days later, he confessed his love to me. That time i didn't think he's a bad guy because he didn't ask for some nude photos so i think there's nothing wrong to continue chatting with him. Days passed, and he told me that he was bidding for a contract, and only 7 companies will be chosen out of 14. Afterwards, he said he got the contract and he did shopping for himself and mine as well. He wants to send the package to me. I said to him i don't need that we just know each other for a few days. But he insisted. He gave me the tracker but the receiver was not my name so i skeptically believe him. And later on i am sure that this guy was fake because the photos he keeps n sending is a Korean actor. I did my own investigation because i feel sad for myself because i wasted my time to someone who is a scammer. I hope my story would help you guys to not easily trust people whom you meet in online.

Matched with a "China" guy Zhou Kai through Bumble and thereafter moved the conversation to Telegram (+669841524?? | @zhou123?) and then to Whatsapp (+669889138??). Those were Thailand numbers, he claimed he used to stay at Phuket and was lazy to change the numbers associated with Telegram/Whatsapp. We chatted fervently from noon to 2am daily via Chinese text/voice messages. He claimed he doesn’t use his phone in mornings as he’s busy with work. He was very ‘attentive’ as he remembered what I’ve said before. Shortly after, he professed his liking towards me and I noticed he deleted the Bumble app which he claimed he wants to concentrate on someone he likes and urged me to delete the app as well, so he doesn’t have to compete with others. He mentioned his hobby on blockchain technology, which his university professor introduced. He asked if I’m keen to try i could download the app (https://www.bitfinex3??.com/web/down/hb). I thought the website looked legitimate due to the https. Later I realized this was a spoof website, whose domain was registered in July 2020, but he has dabbled in this app for a few years. He was very patient with me and praised me for being smart in following the steps to buy cryptocurrency and transfer to the fake app’s wallet. Spent $1k on my first investment for the futures trading, which netted in a small profit (the bait) and I was able to withdraw the entire sum back in my bank account. Looking back, he was very manipulative, cunning, and convincing. For some days he would talk about random lifestyle stuffs, tailored and peppered with sweet nothings without mentioning anything about the investment. There were some red flags but I had brushed them off since I saw that i was able to encash the profit. He later convinced me to transfer $6k SGD to the platform (his initial target was $10k) and the trading "earned" $500+ USD. He said I didn’t have to withdraw the funds since the buying/transfer process was tedious. Few days later, he further pushed me to put in another $6k SGD to the platform, which “earned” $2.5k USD. He claimed his analysis of the data/trends gave him 80% confidence of making profits during good days. He shared screenshots of his trades (both losses/profits) as well as his holdings on the platform ($156k USD). I subsequently found his second profile in Bumble and confronted him, where he flared up and claimed I distrusted him, and that his photos were stolen. I tried to withdraw the money in my account on the fake app, and the system restricted me from withdrawing, stating that they require I trade 100% of whatever funds I have on hand in the same day in order to withdraw. They also suggested I topped up more money to upgrade to VIP level, where there’ll be no restrictions on the withdrawal. I did not proceed, and I've lost a total of 12k SGD at this point.
the scammer called me on my number, pretending to call from DBS with a broken english on the 23.10.2020 @ 10:40 am. i just drop the call and there were no lost. i just want to report this number used by the scammer 9465146?.
I received a phone call from a lady with what sounded like a foreign (south asian) accent. she said that she was from "singtel" and wanted to do a check on a recent test that they had done to my internet because the line was recently cut. i was mildly convinced at that time because we did have trouble with our internet recently, with weak internet strength. she asked me to check on how many lights are present on the router. i said 3. then she asked me to test the speed of my internet by typing in "test internet speed" on google. she asked if there were differences in upload and download speed - i said there was. she then went on to say that it is the result of the singtel troubleshoot test and they have already resolved the issue. she then asked me to type in "my ip" on google and report whether it says "public" or "private" under it. at this time, i grew suspicious and asked her why she needed to know details about my ip. she said she just wanted to know whether it was "private" or "public". I decided this could be a "foot-in-the-door" tactic and that revealing any information about my ip could be potentially harmeful, SO I ENDED THE CALL.
I was given a call today by a lady who sounded like she came from overseas. The first thing that struck me was how patchy the call was, and how slowly she seemed to respond what I was saying. She told me that there was an issue with the internet address I had- my ip address was supposed to be "private", but it was "public" and that my internet would be cut because they were trying to fix this issue. She instructed me to type "my ip" into a search bar on my laptop to prove she was correct. Thereafter she proceeded to ask me other details like modem information, how many lights were on on my modem, or which was the main device I used in the house which seemed suspicious . I asked her to verify first whether she was from Singtel and how I could, she quoted me this number " 8004922408" to call, but I didn't think the number resembled a Singapore line or any recognisable number, so I left her on the phone, checked the Singtel hotline and called them to verify if this lady was working for them. they confirmed this was a scam. I put the phone down immediately. I hope more people hear about this so they too won't give out valuable information about their network settings.
I received a call yesterday from +65 6609 2907 claiming to be "dbs", and they said they have been trying to contact me because there was an important message/problem with my bank account, i was asked to dial "3" to proceed. (earlier the day, i also received spam calls thrice, with no one speaking at the end of the call.) Once i did that, i was directed to the 'customer service' and someone speaking in mandarin spoke to me and said he was from the Chinese customer service department from the DBS HQ at Marina Bay.He said that I've owed sgd1260 from a credit card spend and that it would be deducted from my account in two hours if unsettled. I told him that i didn't have any credit card and did not make that spend. So he said that maybe someone had used my details to create a credit card and spent money using it. He told me that he would call his manager over to speak to me, and the 'manager' explained that i would need to make a report to the 'international police in beijing' to ask them to check who was the one who created the credit card account, and to send a report to DBS to verify that it was not me who signed the credit card.I was directed to a china number (+86 10 8408 1110) who claimed to be the 国际刑警, and explained the case to him. He said that to file a case for them to conduct the search, they'd need me to make a recording of my case. The man then said to use whatsapp/qq/other channels to call so as to free up the police hotline. So he called me on whatsapp using another number (+86 186 7518 5283), sent me a couple of verifications eg police id and asked for my verifications so i gave him my personal details. As I happened to have things to tend to, I told them I would call them again. So I hung up the call and later made a trip to the DBS physical staff, where their staff identified it to be a scam and quickly helped me to check my account and change my password.
I met this guy, Steven Benardo, virtually via online dating website OkCupid. After conversing via WhatsApp for a couple of weeks and having made plans to meet up on Sunday, 25 October, he suddenly says that he has no cash flow and having problems with his offshore bank account, and asking for me to loan him $5,000 to open up a bank account in Singapore.He claims he is from Canada, only child, 40 this year and working in a oil and gas company based in Jurong Island, and that his work requires him to be on a ship tanker. He also claims that it is his first job outside of his home country and does not know much about how the different banks in Singapore works, hence he asked for my assistance on giving him a loan. After I rejected him, he started getting angry over the phone, and kept insulting me. After a few hours, he would text me again, asking for help.I have since blocked his number.Below are his contact details that he gave me:Email: steveofficial0?@gmail.comContact number: +65 8104 1??
I received a phone call claimed to be from dbs bank and requested me to collect document from DBS bank. I quickly hung up the call and called DBS bank to verify and confirm it is scam call.
I received an automated call from 9123 9343 and asking to press 9 to speak person, lady by name Lee Lin Mee spoke to me stating its a call from Singapore High Court. she mentioned a case with high court is registered under my name for money laundering since a person by name Joey Tan claimed to have known me. She later collected my full name and NRIC claiming that a Interpol office by name Eric Wong will talk to me and share more details. As i was waiting for the call to be transferred i did a quick check in internet and found out to be a scam and became alert. however, i still wanted to see what does the so called Interpol officer will talk to me about. he was talking very rudely and asked me same details as the previous lady was asking me. i replied to him rudely too that since I already shared case number what's the need to ask for same information again. he insisted that share with him what did the previous lady inform me about, By this time, I got really impatient and hung up the call and told him if he do not have details better hang up. I then checked through website and found about similar scam cases.
I received a VOICE CALL From +65 67939388, Claiming that they are from DBS. tHE MOMENT I Press 3, THE GUY Speaks, AND I IMMEDIATELY HANG OUT THE PHONE. This time, the person who spokes have an accent from prc/taiwanese. After hanging up, I recieved ANOTHER CALL +6597034415 and i quickly end the call. LOOK OUT FOR +65, singapore calls don't have +65 call in front.
I received an automated robocall from +6566668931 claiming to be DBS and how they've been trying to reach me as they found an issue(?) with my bank and to press '3' to proceed. I didn't heed their instruction and immediately reject the call as i found it to be highly suspicious. I've heard of phishing call scams before so i'm very wary whenever i received one. it happened this morning 17/10/20 8.04am and this was the second phishing call scam that I've experienced. I didn't lose any money but i know others who would and could fall prey to their scam. If in doubt, go to the authentic sources and clarify your doubts with them. The most important thing is never to divulge personal sensitive details to anyone online and offline.
It started with him liking me on coffee meets bagel in mid may and he asked to move to whatspp the next day. he claimed to be an only child, widower, canadian born with s'porean parents, now a PR. He stays at Bishan, works in oil &amp; gas and drives a mercedes c400. We conversed and text as much as four times daily throughout the 4 month experience. he serenaded to me and even sent me song lists, music and video links. I requested for video chat but he claimed his phone screen was broken. i insisted but all i saw was a black screen which he probably covered up the camera although he could see me. He claimed to have flown to turkey in early June after passing a covid19 test. soon after he had a lot of problems from a fire causing injuries to workers who required hospitalisation, machines were damaged and he had malaria. due to being offshore, he claimed difficulty transferring funds from his offshore bank account at the oil rig so he provided me access to his account. after helping him with 2 transactions, his account was frozen and he started asking for money including money to seek treatment!I transferred usd33,000 over 4 transactions to a foreign account and 2 local accounts over that period. the final straw was when he requested for help to pay resident tax to his bank, i found out he wasn't at the quarantine hotel where he claimed to be and the bank contact details he provided were fake. i sought legal advice and reported to the police. I subsequently found that his phone line was perpetually on airplane mode. the bank website was a fake and the photos of his profile were taken from an instagram account of an american asian.I felt emotionally betrayed by a very skilful and experienced scammer and it was a bitter lesson.
I was looking for personal loan from banks for another debt i had to clear but i was mostly not eligible. I researched on licensed moneylenders and found this website which i checked was under "MOL" registered moneylender so i trusted in them. after i paid them the processing fee of $450 for my initial loan of $4.5k, they said their processing side made a double entry and my loan became $9k instead and that i have to pay another $450 for it to be processed but they will refund it back to me. They did not transfer me any amount. Later, a finance team called me and told me i had to pay another $1080 for the loan to be transferred to me as POSB bank had requested as part of the account validation fee, which was odd. They however promised me they will refund the amount back to me together with my loan as it was their company's processing error.i asked for a proof or get dbs to call me. they then sent me a dbs document referring to the account validation fee. i then forwarded it to dbs to which they had verified that there was no such thing as an account validation fee and that the document was fake, do not transfer any more money to that company and advised me to lodge a police report immediately. Be careful everyone! Note: All licensed moneylenders are registered with the Ministry of Law. Please only get in touch via the contact details found in this list: https://rom.mlaw.gov.sg/files/ML%20Lists/ML%20List%20as%20at%20011020.pdf Reference: https://rom.mlaw.gov.sg/information-for-borrowers/list-of-licensed-moneylenders-in-singapore/
Received a call from a local mobile number +65 87742030, when i picked up was greeted by an automated voice message from “dbs bank” telling me that they have tried to contact me many times unsuccessfully. i was directed to “press 3” to speak with a customer service representative, but hung up. sharing this for awareness as people should be wary that there are a lot of callers with (+65) numbers impersonating banks/telcos/govt agencies nowadays.
I was looking to borrow money from a moneylender and came across this website - www.sg-loanhu?.com/ After providing my contact details, I received a text which informed me to transfer some fees over to 'test my bank account'. After the initial transfer, another girl from the moneylender contacted me and told me to pay a loan insurance of $1500. Again, i transferred to them. After that, I was contacted by another person and he told me to open an account with them and needed me to pay a processing fee of $1,000 through 2 transfers. After I made the transfer, another person contacted me to ask me to settle the last fee before they can release my loan to me. I believed them and transferred again. I thought that it's my last fee to pay before I could get my loan. But the story went on! I was contacted by another person and this time, I was asked to pay another fee for government tax and lawyer fee which amounted to $3220. this time I said "NO!" and to cancel my loan. He shared that to cancel the loan, I had to pay $3800.I told him “no money”. After 1 day, he texted me to tell me that he would offer a discount and asked me to pay $2300. I told him “No” and ignored them. He texted me again to tell me to settle the issue and called me many times but I didn’t pick up his calls. Then on 14/10, another text was sent to me and this time it threatened me that if I didn’t settle the loan, they would come to my house. After that, I went to make a police report. And blocked all their no.
A call from 92520274 was received at 02:25PM 14 October 2020. An automated voice message was telling me this is the singapore high court, and repeated the same thing in Mandarin. I press "9" for more information. Then i waited for a few rings. a guy answered me IN ENGLISH "singapore high court how can i help". By this time i was googling high court call and came across many instances of scams. I answered "i got a call but i'm not sure what is it for...?" Then I immediately disconnected my call.
The caller wasn't local, he pretended to be the staff from Singtel saying that my line will be cut off in two hours’ time. He told me all telecos are under "Singtel" but that’s how I uncovered his lies.
I received a robocall informing me that my mobile plan will be DISCONNECTED in 2 hours, and in order to prevent that you have to press a number on your phone. The message is in English and Mandarin. I have received other calls these past 2 weeks impersonating different companies, but the type of scam (asking to press numbers on your phone) IS THE SAME. Be aware to those type of calls!
I received a voice automated call impersonating Singapore high court but I did not follow the instructions and hung up
Someone had already shared the experience but i was unlucky and careless. I received an SMS from "Singpost" yesterday evening. Was not paying attention and provided my apple id and password. Before i realised its a scam it was too late. Scammer have removed my trusted phone number. Really stress about it as Apple is helpless in re-authenticate my number. I cannot get back my apple id ever again. And the thing is the apple id will still be there in the hand of the scammer! Please be alert!
I received below SMS. [SingPost]You have the goods to be signed. Please check: https://is.gd/h2XdU? (Note: Phishing site)
Received an unknown call from +6568867579 but i ignored it. the caller then left a voice message. I listened to the contents of the voice mail which was repeated 3 times - 1st and 3rd time in Mandarin, 2nd time in english. all messages were pre-recorded.1st and 3rd time in Mandarin: (translated) dear user, your phone will be forcibly stopped in 2 hours time. please press "5" for more details. 2nd in English: this is an important notice. your phone will be stopped in 2 hours. press "5" for more information.I realised that this was a scam after an initial scare. Please know that scammers will threaten you to get you to react immediately. Do not give in to threats and telecos will NOT cut your line without first informing you via official correspondence.
Received a text message from (singpost) which says that i have goods to be signed. Please check the link provided. When i clicked on the link, brought me to a singpost page which looks legitimate. Details i had to key in was my appleid, which should have been the first alarm. But as i was busy, i half-concentrated and keyed in my id. But the phone started to lag and i thought something was not right. Went back to the site and tried clicking all the other links on the homepage but it went to a dead end. Definitely a phishing attempt. I then noticed on my phone that there was a new device logged into my apple id. Quickly changed my passwords a few times and signed out that device. Checked all my credit card, icloud and other information. So far nothing was lost, but will be on lookout for suspicious activities over the next few days. Do not click on the links provided in SMS or emails without verifying it. It does not make sense for SingPost to ask for your Apple ID!
A lady called in from the number +65 81814120, mentioned that they are calling from singtel and needed some personal information for clarification. As I'm not Singtel customer, I requested for them to call me from the main singtel hotline for verification. They couldn't. Please be careful, everyone!
Called me to inform and asked me to press 5 . Call claimed that I have an important notification from MOH, i pressed 5 and was asked to talk to a guy, who spoke in Mandarin. It just didn't feel fright for a government agency to speak in Mandarin.. I hung up the call.

Call from "DBS" turned out to be a scamSimilar thing happened to me as well. Caller claimed to be from dbs &amp; mentioned that they tried to contact me multiple times but however it does not make sense as dbs does not use a personal number to call you. The number that called me is 9663 8249.Please take note because they will ask you to press a number to enter and they most probably will ask you for the details!I just hung up this call and block the number.

I received a phone on Friday. Caller had a strong Indian accent, claimed that he was calling from microsoft and microsoft has received numerous error message from my computer. I ask how can i know for sure he is from microsoft, he said he has my pc id number and he can tell me my pc id. i told him i did not even know my pc id - he then walked me through while i was at my pc on how to get my pc id , the number generated from the dos window matches what he recited to. he then directed me to check the administration events for errors and when i told him there are many errors, he sound serious and advised that i need to get these errors fixed. i told him i do not trust him and i need more than just pc id to confirm. i said if he is really from microsoft please email me with microsoft email. he then said he could give me his staff id so that i can call to verify. i hung up the call and i have not receive any email in 1hour time. Good thing i read about similar tech-scam here.
I received an automated voice call from dbs (+65 92532368) 2 days ago (07/10/2020), saying the bank has been trying to contact me innumerous times, and i should press certain number on my phone in order to proceed with the call. The voice message was in English and Mandarin, and it sounded legit, but i immediately suspected that it was a scam and disconnected, as i have never been contacted by DBS before and the "numerous attempts of contacting me" did not make any sense.
I received a call from +6568081267 this morning at 7.33am. A lady claimed that she was calling from Singtel Technical Dept to check on my internet connectivity problem.

A loud alarm sound which got me to panic mode, a pop up screen showing "Microsoft edge" with a number appeared, I called thinking my laptop will be infected by a virus. the scammer had a thick accent, but he convinced me to give him remote access to my laptop, to create a "firewall" as some hackers are trying to get my bank details. unfortunately I keyed in my bank details &amp; log-in id and OTP, hacker said I "do not" have to tell him my pin I just have to key it in. he told me not to login to my internet banking, and put me on the line for many hours! I did not have the chance to talk to anyone during this duration. I lost $12.5k as he did a "cash advance" on my credit card! it was transferred to another account in the same bank, but now the bank is demanding for payment from me, as investigation is still ongoing. Do not give remote access to anyone! And if a pop-up window appears randomly at while you are surfing some sites, DO not click!
Received a call from DBS saying i have a credit card applied in China and have been trying to contact me numerous times. Saying i will be getting a fine if i dont pay in 2 hours as the credit card debt has not been paid. $1,265 SGD. Asked me to come to Financial Centre to settle it. when i said i could come down immediately. He told me he would get his manager to clarify. But told me the same thing again. asked me to call china DBS bank for CCTV footage and confirmed that I did not apply for the card. This all turned out to be a scam.

Received a robocall basically telling me to collect document from DBS. Press "3" to contact DBS. Please ignore and hang up the call.
I received a call from this caller posing as 'DBS bank' saying that i have left a document behind, press '3' to speak to their customer service officer. it was an automated message in both English (very strong chinese accent) and Mandarin It was definitely a scam because dbs bank will not get a Chinese national to record automated messages.
The call began with a operator-like voice saying I've been contacted many times by DBS bank and couldn't be found. Now, I have a package with the bank and I have to press #3 to continue. I'm pretty sure this is a scam call designed to phish information.
At around 11:30 on 2 October 2020 I saw an ad on shopee for a laptop going at $550 so I went to pm the seller and ask if it still available. And got a response in a few mins saying yes so I text them on WhatsApp for fast response and was told not to order from Shopee as they will have to give 50% of what they are selling. So I asked what they want me to DO and was told to transfer money to them so they can put me on the next delivery so I will get my item by 3pm today. I was not thinking a lot that time all I ask for was an invoice after the payment was make they did sent an invoice it look so real. So I waited till 3pm there was no delivery so I ask the guy he told there an issue on his side and told me that wait till 7pm but still no delivery man so I text him again but this time he call me and demand for $300 because he was stuck on singapore Airport customs but I did not give him as I realised he was not in Singapore and don't sound like a Malaysian man more like an Africa man and after a long talk and text he told me he will Refund me the next MORNING at 9am. So the next morning I text him to update me when he transferred my money and waited till 11am got his reply asking for a new sim card number and then I will get my refund back at first I don't know what was their intention but after I got the new sim he told me to give the 6 digits code for WhatsApp so I did and after that he ask me for a new shopee account they make using the new SIM number I Got but I didn't give that where when I checked the old Shopee account they were using was banned i knew that they needed a new one.
I received a call from +6590319938, posing as DBS bank saying that they have tried to call me many times and asked me to press #3 to directly connect to customer care to discuss some important issue.

i received a friend request on instagram on 19/09/20. the next day he strike a conversation with me. his ig account name is iamharry_adam. his name is jang. he told me hie is a korean staying in manchester uk. he is 30 years old and single. we chat for a few days on line app after that. then he said he wanted to send me a love gift card. he asked me if i am willingly to accept his gift and asked for my address and mobile number to be couriered to. i skeptically gave it to him. he then sent me a verification code and the link to click on to arrange for delivery. i googled the courier company name universal express courier (www.uexpresscourier.com) but it was blocked. then i tried clicking the link given by jang but luckily it was blocked by sg MDA as well, saying it possible scam. I confronted him and he got angry and say im mad and stupid for suspecting him. then he blocked me on ig. the next day i received a whatsapp text from an unknown number +6586487752. he said his name is mohamed harris and he has got instructions from a mr jang fom uk to deliver a parcel and ask for my verification code. I ignored the message. and by now i am very sure he is trying to scam me. so i used his photo to check using google reverse image search and saw that he actually is a impersonator. the guy i spoke to for the past week is not even the guy in the photo. the photo belongs to someone else. meanwhile, this jang kept asking me why i did not reply the courier guy. i sent him a pic of the actual guy in his real ig account and said i already made a police report and goodbye. then I changed my privacy settings in my ig account and closed my line account for good. actually all along i have noticed something strange about him. his followers and those following him on IG fluctuate lot everyday. most of his followers are ladies from singapore, thailand, vietnam, taiwan , philippines. and mostly married and with kids. he doesnt tell me much about himself. When I asked if Jang is his last name, he reply just "jang". so ladies, please be careful of these scammers and do not hesitate to google or talk to someone if you think is a fraud.

I was googling for personal loan and stumble upon this website and the company was called credit-8?, i wanted to take up a $4k loan and was contacted by a guy called christian, he called me once and susequently we whatsapp each other, he nevr did inform me abt collateral fees to be paid before the funds can be disbursed, a sum of $720 was needed to secure the sum. I told him that this was a lot and asked for deferment and reduced the amt to $360 instead. On the morning of 30th sept, i ws him to agree on trfing the $360 to secure the loan, sum was transferred and a few mins later, he replied with shots from MAS that I needed to settle a 10% GST to $400 before the loan can be disbursed. I sensed something is wrong and called up credit-89, there's no such person working in that company at all. I realized i've been scammed and immediately went down to the police station to make a report. I blocked him on Whatsapp, number and now i fear for the safety of my family as a copy of my nric is with him and i feared my personal data might be misused. Lesson learnt not to apply online but go over to the company phonline instead.
I have been receiving a few calls from DBS and in this incident someone with an automated voice saying that they are from MOH ministry of Health saying that I have an important message.

I connected with this guy who goes by the name ‘Keat chang’ on the cmb app. WitHin an hour of chatting, he asked that we moved our chat to whatsapp and also that we both exit the dating app. He claimed that he spoke to two other ladies before on the app but since theY both have found ‘the one’, they have exited the app. He said he’s a singaporean who just Returned from uk to Sg three years ago. Lived and studied in uk fOr most of his life. He has a mum in sG and only child. Also cLAimS that his ex-GF chEated on him with his best frIend. Red flags that this person is a scammer:- - Professed his undying love wIthin days -- texting regularly every day with frequent updates - left for a work trip within two days of chatting - claimed to be doing his own oil and gas biZ and this is his first project in uzbekistAn - asked for personal details regarding job and family - The final straw: Asked for a a favour as his machine that he bought broke down and he needed cash to help. Needed to transfer money from his online account to the supplier (The catch: he’s on an oil rig which would limit access to his online account and therefore need needed you to help do the transfer first). - Pleaded for your help Do this Instead: - just Say no - Block him immediately - flag Him on the dating app I learnt a precious lesson that took all of three weeks...trust your instincts. True love doesn't require money!
Was in need of some cash. Browsed through Facebook and saw this ad from joth?moneylender. A guy named Samuel contacted me. He forged email from MAS and asked me to transfer admin fee, validation fee and all kinds of fees before my loan could be disbursed. Even lied and said that I gotten this `SAMUEL' into trouble with the law and the manager Jeffery took over. Was scammed almost $11k. Wish to inform all that licenced moneylenders are not allowed to advertise their services and will need to approve the loan face to face. They will not ask for any fees before loans can be disbursed.
I received a call from an unknown number saying it was from Singapore's dbs company with the DBS logo set as the profile picture, phone number ( +92 310 2150481 ) on 26 Sep 2020. They told me that my card had been blocked but no money was lost. But the thing is that I currently have no credit card in my possession so it was already obvious it was a scam especially just by looking at the phone number is it not from Singapore.

Then I ask them whats my name and FIN number. They said they can't provide it's because of confidentiality. I said its confidential for others not for me. Just tell me my name.

RECEIVED a friend request from my senior from SCHOOL. I have followed her, but i thought she possibly could have created a new account. Once accepted, I received a private message from the account asking for my phone number. I did not think much of it and just gave it and asked if she had changed phone, she gave me a 'like' on the answer without actually saying yes. The next moment she sends a 'Shopee 7th Year Special Campaign' and asked me to send her all the otps i receive. I kept receiving multiple otps so kinda gave them to 'her' without realizing i was getting charged. When i did not give 'her' the otp within 2 minutes, 'she' KEpt calling my phone through instagram video call. I picked up the call once but showed the ceiling instead, 'her' video call was blurred and immediately 'she' hangup after a few SECONDS and 'she' would rudely demands for the code by JUST texting 'code?' The moment i realized it was a scam when 'she' sent me a picture of Shopee stating i have won S$950 for VOTING and requires me to give her my credit card details so money can be transferred. At that point i just ended the CONVERSATION. When i checked my grab app, i realised $110 been paid to Razor Gold. Immediately called and cut off my bank, made a police report and emailed grab at their Help Centre.

I accepted a follow request on Instagram. The account username is 1882_jo. His name is alex kim jong-ho. He started chatting with me on 21 june. He said that he is a 29-year-old korean working in london as a subsea inspector with bv oil company. After that, he was busy and seldom on instagram, so he requested to shift to whatsapp to chat on 6 august. He used a business account. He confessed his love for me on 10 august. He chatted with me every day and called me honey and dear. He even said that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. We sent each other photos and audio recordings. I fell in love with him too. He called me 4 times on the phone. I asked for a video call but he said he was shy. On 13 september, he said that he was done with his work and could not chat on whatsapp anymore. We shifted to google hangouts. On 21 september, he asked me to open a trading account to start investing for our future. I told him that i was not interested. He said that i yelled at him. Then he called me on 22 september. His voice was different from the one that i heard previously. He still claimed that his voice changed because he was stressed. I pointed out to him that it was not possible and he quickly hung up. He sounded like a Caucasian and older. The one that called me at whatsapp sounded asian and boyish. I did a google reverse image search before with the photos that he sent me but there was no result. I just want to warn everyone that there are people operating as a syndicate preying on their victims' emotions and intending to scam money eventually. Their acting was superb. They showered me with love and concern. I didn't lose any money but i was scammed of my feelings and time.
2 weeks ago, A friend of mine whom 8 had not seen for 4 years contacted me thru fb messenger, informing me that she had change her contact no. And ask for mine. I did not suspect anything in the beginning. I asked her how had she been, then she suddenly popped out on shopee 6th year special campaign and she will sent me an sms to take part in the contest. For a sec, i paused and ask her if this is a spam. She answer no. She then generate an otp and asked me to reveal to her. I did give her the OTP, then i asked her where she working now. She didn't answer. So i tried to get her on the line but no answer. For some reason, i just felt that something was very wrong. So, I persisted and asked her where she was working now. She still didn't answer my question but she went on telling me that she would check what i won from the Shopee lucky draw. She went on congratulate me that i have won $1000 on Shopee. At this point, I was sure that my friend's fb acct had been compromised. So, I asked her what to do next. She asked me for my debit and credit card. I also persistent on asking her where she is working now. Still she didn't reply me. I told 'HER' that i have no cards as i prefer using cash. 'friend' ask me if can do card transfer or online banking , i replied, i don't keep money in bank as i keep money at home. 'she' gave me a thumbs up emoji. So i ask 'her' why don't she help me to transfer to her acct and pass me the money when we meetup since we are very good friends. 'she' gave me a thumbs up emoji again. And i still asked her where she was working. Thereafter, she blocked me. Editor's Note: Please not to give out your personal or bank account details and one-time passwords to anyone, including friends and family.

licensed money lender will never ask for submission of documents and validation without you presence physically at their office. And no upfront fee needed until the load is disbursed. i was looking for a loan to clear my credit card debts, then i went to search on google and came across a website sgcreditgro??.com. I asked for a loan of sgd 25000. Later on, one male namely, Bernard tay replied and told me to send my nric front and back, my company name and bank account number. he also made me sign on a contract he sent via whatsapp. After providing him the detail, it was agreed that i pay sgd520 monthly once i received the full payment of sgd 25000. However, bernard told me to pay several fees before he could transfer the full amount to my account. after paying him S$8140, he told me to pay another sgd 1500. that was when I realised that I could have been scammed.
Met "Alvin" at a dating app called bumble. His photos looks nice, like if he is a famous instagrammer or influencer. couldn't find his photo by doing reverse image search so I thought he could be real. He then asked to talk via whatsapp but i refused, so we changed into telegram. He told me that he came from China and worked in singapore for 2 years. he said that he was working at RWS as IT consultant but online platform. I confronted him saying that online gambling in Singapore is illegal, but he insisted that RWS casino has online platform and he has to work everyday, including weekend and he only had days off 4 days in a month. He also had to work overtime everyday and so, he couldn't meet me in person. He also refused to do video call, saying that he was still at work (like at 11 PM still working) and his office doesn't allow him to do video call or take photo due to confidential nature. He told me that he found a way to make money online and asked me to click on a dubious link. I told him that I would not do that unless that he showed me the link in person. He stopped contacting me after that. Be careful of friends who you met online as they may not be genuine.

When i questioned why he was from google if i recieved an earlier call from yahoo, he insisted they were the same company. I politely thanked him and hung up. A minute later “Kerry” called again and also hung up when i shared the google story with her.

The person will ask you to turn on your computer and do a WINdow+R to run EVENTVWR. This will show the events happening in the background of your computer. he/she will ask you to click on custom view in the event windows and then click on administrative events. he/she will ask you to see how many errors/warnings that you have. then they will say, these are the errors and will help you to remove them. then they will ask you to windows+R to run www.anydesk.com and to download an app/software. Please do not download. I ended the call with them thereafter as there is no issue with my computer or my internet. they will continue to persuade you to download the app/software. when you say no, they will tell you that they will need to suspend the internet connection immediately. the person has told me multiple times but it never happen.

They never give up, because they call me multiple times.

Do not engage with these callers and simply hang up!

Scammer called my home and, with an urgent tone, informed me that they had detected suspicious activity from my home internet connection. He said that it could be a malicious software and is using my home computer to make downloads. I asked the caller to give me a name and id so that i can call singtel to verify that his is indeed calling from singtel. He pressed on to ask me to cooperate and gave a name "peter wong" and an id number "05321". The phone connection was very poor and i asked him to repeat the information but he did not do so. Was suspicious due to the quality of the call and he did not sound to have a local accent consistent with the name he gave. He hung up after a while called singtel 1688 and they kindly verified that the call was not made by any singtel representatives. They had advised me not to reveal any details on your broadband or computer to anyone over the phone. Always verify with them first.
A strong indian accented man claims to be calling from dbs/posb head office in marina. He asked for my card details to block my card as dbs was updating something. And that today was the last day. Otherwise card will be locked for 5 years.
2 encounters. 1st Samuel Chong from CMB, quite good looking, claiming he’s a Singaporean but living in USA. Owned a biz in healthcare equipment. Moved our chat to WhatsApp but immediately I spotted its scam because he said he has duo citizenship n holding 2 passports, it’s impossible. We stopped chatting &amp; I blocked him. 2nd encounter, Kelvin Lee, age 50, from Skout. He’s charming, claiming his mum is a Taiwanese n dad from USA. His dad passed away when he was 7 after his mum n him relocated to the US. His ex cheated on him 4 yrs ago. Now he hopes to find a relationship. He received a contract to work with Shell in sg &amp; he’s settling down in sg, hoping to bring his mum to sg soon. Whenever I asked to have video call, it never connect successfully, not even voice chat via Wechat app. All he can do is to send me photos &amp; videos which of course I know can be faked. His profile is found in CMB n stated he’s from UK (instead of USA), age 45.
A guy on Coffee meets Bagel contacted me in sept 2020. He said he was from seoul, korea. He is working as petroleum engineer with company pacific oil and gas in singapore. The company is legit, i checked it out. We chatted for couple of days on Wechat. His wechat id: true_honesty200. He said was on 3-4 months contract and working on a oil rig off turkey and he was head of operations in charge of the oil rig. Was an orphan and goes to church every week. Likes to buy things for orphanage and visits the orphans regularly. Has a pomerian dog named mark. Stays at Tampines. Drives a mercedes amg car and a ferrari in rochester ny. His modus operandi is showing his vulnerable side. He would cry and showed he was sad by some comments i made. He would pray and be very sweet. He would use words like "dear", "honey" and i told him i was uncomfortable. His English and grammar was fairly ok. But because he said he was from Korea, it is easily forgivable if there are mistakes. Lastly, if you asked him about korea food, he can name a few. But when asking about more details which church or locations in singapore, he will avoid and ask you other questions. Not easy to detect he is a scammer. No money was lost as he stopped contacting me. I think it was because i said jokingly i felt he was like a conman sweet talking me into something..Just trust your instincts. If you feel the person is moving too fast or too good to be true (job, material possessions or having faith, being religious, being kind and vulnerable...) Be aware. Also run a check of his profile photos on google image and check if other names show up.
In May 2020, I received a caLl from ms chen jen (staff id 10288) from DHL at changi airpoRt, saying that i had sent a package on 17/3/2020 to xuhuigu, nandan-lu, no. 105, shanghai. Call was connected to mr chen jie, Police officer in shanghai, who informEd the package was confiscated as The contEnTs are fm2, drugs relating to sleepiNg pills, etc. I denied the involvement. Mr chen put me to a video conference via whatsapp. Questioned me as well as taking down my full name, nric number, residential address and mobile number to open a police case and to check whether i have any criminal records. Call duration lasted 3 hours. He told me that i was involved in a money-laundering case in shanghai. If i do not cooperate they will come to arrest me and bring me back to shanghai. I was extremely shocked and agReE to work with him. The mastermind, mr zhang jin, a senior manager in hsBc singapore, had created a saving account under my name on 03/12/2019. He had swindled 16 villagers for the amount of rmb 6million. In exchanged for my nric number he will gIve me 10% commission. The mastermind had been arrested. Mr Chen asked to purchase a 2nd-hand iphone for communication to avoid detection. I had to report to Him twice a day on my movements. Instructed not to leak out anY details to my family members and friends. On 05/09/2020, i was asked to transfer sgd30k to beijing court so that mr Lin, a prosecutor appointed bY beijing court will take up my case and assist to clear my name for money-launderIng. Became suspicious i checked scam-alert.sg immediaTely and i found similar stories here. I’m adding my story in hope that it will benefit someone else.
It happened in June 2020. I met the scammer in CMB dating app (but these scammers can be on any dating app and may have multiple profiles). He was an attractive man (American Chinese with a US number) and quickly wanted to chat on another platform, Whatsapp. At the same time, on the scammer’s dating app profile, it stated that his account would be locked as the administrator needed to verify his identity. I asked him about it and he said he had deleted the app as he had already found “the one”. What I think happened, was that he deleted his profile to avoid getting caught. Like other internet love scams, he had a good job as a petroleum engineer (freelance and based in Kuwait?). He also had a sob story that his father died when he was young and his mum (who is Singaporean) died years ago and he had no siblings. He would message daily to form a close relationship with me and also gain my trust. He also shared his pictures, which I now presume was stolen from someone’s account on the internet. I used the “Reverse image” search for similar pictures in the internet but I could not find anything. He claimed that his contract was ending and that he would want to return to Singapore thereafter. All this while, he gave hope that I would be meeting him eventually in person, hopefully after this Covid pandemic stabilised. Be aware if the scammer is based overseas and gives excuses in not meeting you. After the third week, he said he would now be working at the oil rig. Initially, things would still be going on smoothly for him. However, the oil pump machine started to give him problems. Eventually, the pump spoilt and he said he had to purchase a new pump. While he was trying to transfer money to the supplier for the purchase of the new pump, he said he had trouble logging into his offshore account’s website. He sounded desperate and said that as a last resort, he might need my help in logging into his account, from another country as it might help. Every one should beware, as helping to do a money transfer is also a form of money laundering. He said he would continue to try logging into the bank’s website the next day. Alas, the next day, he still could not log into the bank’s website. When I suggested for him to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to try and log into the website, he said he already tried it and was unsuccessful. This was when the scammer became more ridiculous by asking if I could transfer my money to the company and that he would pay me back the money with interests. When I said I could not help, he whined and said that I could not help him in times of need. I eventually blocked his number on Whatsapp. No money was lost.

The second caller (9542436?) I scolded to stop lying while he insisted I could verify his claim (yeah right). I hung up after a while, boring conversation. Both numbers reported and blocked.

I received a call on 3rd Sep on my mobile, a woman with an Indian accent claimed she's calling from Singtel and told me that my home broadband has suffered a "line cut", don't quite understand what she was saying due to poor voice quality so I hung up. soon after, I got another call, this time from an unknown number, a man also with a heavy indian accent claimed to be a senior tech from singtel and basically try to sell me the story that my home broadband has been hacked and "very bad people from overseas" are using my broadband for malicious activities. to prove his story, he asked me to run the netstat command and read the IP addresses of the last few rows and saying that those are foreign IP addresses. he then directed me to teamviewer.com to download some software so that he can help me "clean up" my home network. I declined and hung up. I checked scamalert.sg immediately after the call and (sure enough) I found a few similar stories here. I'm adding my story in hope that it'll benefit someone. stay safe and be wary of unsolicited calls!
Scammer posing as singtel technician claiming that there is an issue with my internet connection. told them i dont have internet connection under singtel, "she" said that singtel is the main service provider in singapore so they have been tasked to attend to trouble shoot internet connection issues. i asked is this a scam (she obviously denied). Then i insisted that i had no problem i dont have internet with singtel and hung up. just want others to be known of the number used.
I got this scam call today from +21289861587, where the callers (bangladeshi accent) posing as Singtel technical staff claimed that my home Internet connection is being hacked, and they will fix it for me. even though i do not have Singtel, they told me all internet providers in Singapore were "linked" to Singtel (strange).. they did not sound anything like Singtel staffer, so I was suspicious already. They asked me to check if any blinking lights on my internet modem. there was one,. they said it indicates my network is hacked. (wrong,.. blinking light just indicates network communication is ongoing). then they asked me to execute command "assoc" on my comp, which displayed a number which they spelt out for me to check if correct. it was correct. i googled it. it is a generic CLSID for Microsoft software and every windows computer has the same number...my suspicion grew) They said only me and my internet provider Starhub should know this number (ok...then how did this person from Singtel know it !?!). then they asked me to execute command "netstat" on my comp, that shows which devices are connected to my network. they said the ones appearing under "foreign address" are the ones which are hacking my network. I told them I only see my own computer name there ;). they said that means hackers are posing as "you" (nice try, i said to myself). then they asked me to execute command from my computer, then I asked them what was it for? they told me it will download a software that will "kill" all the hacking computers and make my network safer. I googled the command and saw it is used to lure you into downloading a scam software which they will actually use to hack your network/computer. At this point, I was damn sure they were hackers. i told them i am not going to download anything, my network is just fine, and I "know" that they are hackers. at which point they hung up immediately. I have also made a police complaint..
So i was using tantan and this guy matched, so he went on to say that he is from taiwan and come singapore to work for uncle. So he will try to chit chat to gain your trust and after a while tell you that he is doing some cyptocurrency trade that he is earning lots in a day. sending screenshots of profits and whatsapp call to explain. eventually asking if you wanted to play by putting in minimum $500 for as start in a web call huobi. I found him quite suspicious and tried googling about this sort of scams and there's one similar story. luckily i am cautious and not giving money and personal information online, ESPECIALLY to those that did not meet in real life. no money was lost and i've reported to the app and banned him.
I received this call number @8806 1176 on my hp claiming to be from IMDA spore wanting to cut off my existing mobile number within 2 hours bec there was a complaint lodged in beijing police station that a mobile number @9662 60?? was registered under my name sending out scams call and beijing police station want to take legal action agst me.. I was then put to a so called supervisor ( chen jia) phone number @ 9260 15?? in imda spore who then transfered my call to beijing police station. The police officer insisted that i take a flight to Beijing to clarify the matter. This police officer in beijing made me to do video conferencing via Whatsapp and questioned me as well as taking down my full name, i/c number, address and mobile number. The police officer used my i/c number and checked whether i have any criminal records.Then he told me i am involved in moneylaundering business and they are going to arrest me because i collaborated with this man (Kang Qing) in china who was then already arrested. He even threatened me that no one is going to employ me anymore. He keeps on interrogating me and said that the Singapore Police is aware of it. I got very frustrated and told him fine when in the first place I didn’t commit any crime at all and I hung up the call.
I received a call from +60171587232. the person claimed to be a Singtel technician and informed me there's something wrong with my internet connection. i said i couldn't hear him because i wanted to record the conversation (i figured quickly it was a scam) and said that i only had a Starhub connection. then i asked again if it was my phone or home line and he said he was calling from starhub. i pretended to be confuse and asked if he was asking for my Singtel line which was my phone network. he decided the best way to manage this was to say Singtel and Starhub was under the same tech company. Before he could continue, I quickly interjected and asked if m1 is also under his account because my ipad connection is very weak. He ended the call immediately.
On 20 august 2020 at 10.48 am, i received a call from a indian man introduced himself as " austin" from singtel security team. He claimed that singtel has detected my wifi has been hacked and that he assured me that he was here to help eradicate those hackers. He then asked me to install a software called " anydesk", which i later found out it is a remote desktop software. He led me to key in something in the search tool that seemed like a software that indicated my desktop have been hacked up to 9800 times since last september 2019.He continued to run some software which i only found out later that this process was to download or upload lots of date from or into my desktop. During the data loading process, there were intermittent message popped out that indicated 9 hackers were attempting to hack into my pc and my banking account. He then asked me to log in to my bank account so that he could get rid of those hackers. I log into my dbs account but i did not activate my 2fa authentication as i was still quite skeptical. After i logged in, i was quite suspicious as he kept going to the page that displayed my bank details. After a minute, another message popped out from the software that showed only 5 hackers remaining which austin claimed he had eradicated 4 hackers. Next he asked me to log in to another bank account which i followed his instruction.I began to get suspicious as his tone began more anxious than at the initial stage when he sounded calm and assuring. He also instructed me not to leave the phone or tell anyone as the hackers were attempting to hack into my banking account. As i was responding to him using my phone speaker, i called Singtel to verify. When Singtel confirmed it is a scam, i terminated all the software that were running on my pc and hanged up my mobile phone instantly and called the two banks to terminate my internet banking immediately. After hanging up my phone, he continued to call me repeatedly for the next three times.This guy sounded professional and well-trained such that he was able to use psycho-emotional technique to manipulated human behaviour. First, he instilled fear by claiming that my wifi network has been hacked. Next, he used soothing tone to provide assurance. He was patient enough to ask me to log into my bank account only after 30 min of selling trust by showing those convincing data. Please do not allow unknown personnel to gain access to your computer or download any unknown software.

I've asked how to post in shopee, thn he told me to post in carousell in my account. then i came to know that posting means selling in carousell. i created 3 posts and saw that there was one message in carousell telling me about this scam. initially i ignored it without reading.

I immediately deleted all my postings and blocked and reported that whatsapp number i was contacting. also, carousell blocked my account immediately after. so far i have not lost anything, but i have provided my phone, address, name and email. i should never fall for home based data entry job offerings.
Malaysian guy identified himself as Singtel technician, i missed his first call, but he called again and i picked up. he told me that my computer was COMPROMISED as someone had hacked through my computer to use my wifi. he PERSISTENTLY said that he is calling "to teach how to protect my devices from future hacks". He provided a step by step to run the command 'Netstat' on command board to show how the computer has been 'Compromised' and requested to download a software. After asking him to why i have not received any notice from singtel, he refused to answer any of my questions and raised his voice to follow his steps exactly. i told him i will clarify with singtel directly and ended the call immediately. please beware of any unsolicited caller who indentify themselves as "Singtel" staff!!!
A scammer called and identified as he is from Microsoft and he knows my email address and mobile. He said that I have purchased a particular software in 2018 through Microsoft and the partner company is no longer in service so Microsoft wants to refund the amount to me. I asked how and he proceeds to want to assist me in the processing of this refund. He asked me to get online and go to this website: "ultraviewer.com" to download ultraviwer and let him has remote access to my pc so he can help me process the claim. He assured me that throughout the remote access process, I will be able to see what he is doing and so I should be "at ease". I find this really suspicious and asked for more details. He kept saying that if I want my refund I have to follow his steps. At this point, I got really upset and asked him to bugger off and keep the refund. He didnt call again. I just want to warn everyone to beware of this. Caller is calling from an "unknown" (no caller ID) number and sounds like an Indian male. Do becareful of this scam. I cannot imagine what he will install on my pc once he has access to it.

He (Suhaimi) said, "You will have to buy directly from us because if you pay through Lazada, the item will be posted as a set." So you will have to wait abut 3 weeks before you receive your item because many customers order."

i WAS IN A ZOOM MEETING WHEN IT SUDDENLY SAID "CONNecting..." and it directed me to a tab in google asking me if i would like to enter the meeting again, then it led me to another tab and suddenly a huge siren sounded and it said that it was the "singapore police" and that i had done something illegal on an illegal website and said that i have 1 hour to pay the fee when i did not even know how much it was. I tried closing the window but it would not let me. i thought quick and pressed the "esc" button on my keypad and found out that it was not an actual tab just a filter and closed it. i had to re-enter the meeting again for it to continue. thankfully, nothing was lost during the incident.

I got a phone call by an Indian person. He called to report some SUSPICIOUS activity on my laptop . He said that, "Singtel had been receiving notifications that there are some hacking activity happening on my laptop.". so I told them i don't use singtel. I saiD that i use my hotspot and that they should contact my parents instead. then they said, " are you using the laptop or your parents?" they then made some comment like ( you mean you don't have a laptop?" of course i said i had one and was using one and then they said, "it doesn't matter what you use because the moment you turn on your laptop, the hackers will keep hacking and we will get the notifications." Then I told him, "thank you for informing me, i will contact singtel directly to find out is this true." The guy at the other end got so mad. He demanded an EXPLANATION as to why i don't trust them and they are trying to help me and that I must listen to them. I sad that i didn't believe him because he was using a handphone number and no a singtel company number. also the claims he was making was ridiculous. He kept getting angrier so i just ended the call.

I heard a rooster crowing suddenly. I told her i do not have computer at home and cannot connect to network. she tries to coax me into logging into network for configuration. i told her to call back in 3 hours time. this gives me time to check and verify. I did not provide any personal details or passwords.
Same as some of the other stories about singtel impersonation scams - an indian woman called, claimed to be a singtel staff who wanted to check on the security status of my network as it was "outdated". She was also initially adamant about having my parents on the line instead, claiming that she needs to provide a "security code". I told her that my parents were not home as i was suspicious of the call. She subsequently asked to run a windows command (windows+r) claiming to check for potential hackers trying to access my internet connection, and proceeded to direct me to a website called www.teamviewer.com. That was when i hung up knowing that it was a website that enables remote desktop access onto my device. Do be careful of similar calls of people claiming to be staff of a company, and check directly with the relevant parties or companies if necessary before entertaining such callers.

A lad claiming to be from "Singtel" called me around 4PM and saying that there was something wrong with my internet connection.

Caller had a strong an indian national, claimed that he was calling from singtel technical dept. explaining the reason why he called. Saying that my home internet got hacked into and wanted to get more information from me. I immediately felt not right and told him that i dont use singtel broadband or internet. getting impatient, he then told me it's not about singtel line etc, trying to make me listen. As his tone is getting fiercer, i immediately cut him off and shut off the line. Then, I went to call Singtel to verify if the phone number belongs to their technical dept. Singtel assured and confirmed with me that their technical dept dont do personal calls to customers unless they requested to be called back after logging in an issue.
I received a call from +65 96007697 (of Indian nationality). If this is indeed a scam/ phishing, I think this would help raise awareness that there might be an increase trend from many other parts of the world etc. and better help raise awareness. I was told the call was from Singtel technical support team and there are unauthorized usage of my Broadband. I told them that my provider was M1, but they claim Singtel is the main provider of bandwidth for all the telcos (which have some truth). In any case, they did some checks on how many device connected, who is the main user without any information identification checks. After which they wanted me to access my board band (i think it's IP address) by my computer to "Show me" the errors. This was a red flag and I told them to call me back another day. This is such an obvious scam!
1) caller called first time to conduct survey and shared that they had upcoming event in sg. 2) caller called A month after said event to say that i had won a prize even though i did not attend. The reason i won was because They enrolled me as i had completed survey and even though i didnt attend, they enrolled everyone who completed survey due to covid. Prize was third prize travel voucher but due to coVid i could exchange it for cash. Caller then gave me her company name,her name and company number. Had a long talk and she said how i shouldnt share the news first as she had to fill up a form to submit to her backend For approval (because i wasnt present at event). I then gave her my full name and nric number (i swear ill never do that again). She then said it would take 1/2 days to process and she would call me back, she then convinced me not to tell my family first since its not approved yet to not make them disappointed. Also told me to not tEll friends as they could take advantage of me ( it sounded Really friendly at that point in time). 3) she also talked about how others also got their gifts and kept reassuring i need not pay anything. But after researching on company and said event, i cant find any more logical reason that this lucky draw is true. Will be ignoring any future calls and please be careful everyone. I used to laugh it off that i will never fall for this but i just did. Got carried Away by greed. Take care peeps and don't trust people so easily!

Today, at 2.00pm, i received a call from +65 9749038?, which i clearly knew was a scam call. It was first an automated voice, which said, "hello, good afternoon.

After approval, the funds will transfer to your preferred account within 3 hours. Press 1 for more information. Your call will be diverted to our sales officer. Press 2 to repeat the message." I press 1 and it was transferred to a lady with a filipino accent. She said the company's name was 'ac? capital' and asked me how much i wished to loan. I said i wanted to loan $2,000. Next, she asked what was my monthly salary and said that they can approve loan amounts within 2 to 2.5 times the monthly income. She said somebody from the sales department will contact me again today regarding my application. She said her name was 'avi'.After that, I called the number back and not surprising that it was an invalid number.

https://scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-10Jun2019161626PM https://scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-01Aug2020123835PM Similarly to these cases above, i was contacted by a friendly taiwanese woman claiming that i've won hk$530k (3rd prize) and would need to provide nric+name+dob+marital status+occupation for her team to verify my identity for prize redemption which would take 1-2 working day... how it went: 1) call to invite event 2) call for attendance 3) call to say i've won 3rd prize + ask for identity verification 4) confirmation on verification + ask for bank account no. please be careful. 1. caller was able to detect the info i've provided was false in the beginning. 2. she was able to provide a website to prove her said company. 3. she will come up with many stories to manipulate your thoughts to trick you into divulging more details. (such as knowing ur telco) 4. do your part to verify business registration no, if possible. xinhongda (HK) was found dissolved on hk govt website.
Caller claimed to be from singtel and offering to assist to fix some connection issues. The sound was very distant and choppy, and it was clear he was speaking off a speech so i caught on early. however, this is an old scam that is still running so please be careful.

Received a phone call at 2pm on thursday 30th july from +65 86548072 the person on the line indicated himself to be from singtel and calling regarding traffic overload on my wifi (many people from different locations accessing my router) This alone was suspicious because an official singtel service wouldn't be calling from a mobile phone. He then asked me to check how many lights on my router was flashing and if i had the wifi bills with me. after i said no, my parents are the ones paying the bills, he asked if he could speak with them, but they were not home, so i asked if he would like to call back later just to see how far he would take this, but he just cut the call. also here's the kicker, my wifi is under starhub not singtel.
I received a call from 'singtel' to say my computer had been hacked by a foreign entity and that they are able to help me deal with this threat.

They tried to convince me to run 'eventvwr', i was told this was top secret and not to share it. I did not run it. At this point I asked them for contact details so I could call them back.

He hung up when he heard the word police. We knew it was a scam because we don't have a singtel connection, ours is a starhub connection.

I do a bit of investment and so i was interested about was she was talking. She bring me into the topic of bit coin and Crypto Currency then i was a bit interested as the stuff she said was legit. Then she say her uncle was in a bank and send me screenshot of picture and official information and then she deleted. So then I was quite interested as she had inside info on the investment. So i went in and follow her steps of investment. Then we added on Whatsapp for more info. At first it was just 800 but then the website showed my coin was showing a very good growth. Due to greed i went to put in another $1000 sgd. The next month(June) another $2000 until on July 7, she started asking me to sell my stocks and invest with her. I felt a bit fishy as she is trying to force me to sell my stock where i do not want to. So in the end i did more research on the website and found out that the coin transferred in could not be taken out. i blocked her immediately on all social media platform and communication All in all, I learnt a lesson but i am just insecure about my info was given to them so I make a police report for a record.
I got to know this guy because he DM me on Instagram. We talked from march 2020 until early July. He always talked about love and tell me that he is Korean who was currently staying in America. He had a construction business in States. At first, he didn't talk about money. We just talked like friends. After he knew that I trusted him, he asked me to help receive money. He told me that the money was from him Mom and asked him why she didnt send it directly to him. He told me his bank account was closed. He asked me buy bitcoin because he used that "currency" more. When this happened too many times, I told him that I couldn't help him anymore as the funds came from different people. I blocked his number immediately. Please be careful when making friends online. Never allow others to use your bank to receive and transfer money!
My story is similar to those shared in Feb and Mar 2020. Got to know Jason (claimed to be a freelance architect) from okc since Mar 2020 and had chatted with him daily for about 4 months. He mentioned he is from moscow, adopted by russian couple and was there since 3 years old. mum passed away, dad at nursing home. he was very sweet, caring. sent me daily morning message and after known him for about a month, he asked for my email address and also sent me daily emails.

He was told client requested compensation of USD 50K and his lawyer had helped him with 24K, left 26K. Called me desperately and sounded super real that he needed help to raise money. I didn't give him any money as I suspected that he's a scammer. Blocked him off after that.

I rceived a call from a lady claiming to be calling from singtel. She started off a call with "how are you today". She had an indian accent and her call quality was very spotty, sounded like an internet call. She told me they had detected some issue with my router and internet connection. She proceeded to ask me to check how many blinking lights there were on my router. I started getting suspicious about her EXPLANATION and requests. She then asked me how many devices are connected to my router. I could barely hear her over the call as her volume was very low, so she eventually transferred me to a "Senior technician" who was a man who also had an indian accent. He also started off the call with "how are you today" He proceeded to explain that they have been detecting some unusual activity in my router from 12am to 6am and that unauthorised people were trying to access my internet. He wanted to "seek my cooperation" to follow his instructions to rectify this issue. he told me to get a device, phone or computer so I went to take my laptop and quickly googled "singtel scam" to which I found the description of this scam. He then told me to go to "spotlight search" on my mac, to which i promptly hung up the phone. Please be wary of such scam phone calls.
details: I received a call from what seemed like a Singapore mobile phone (91617809), so I picked up without suspicion at first. It was an automated computer generated voice claiming to be from the Singapore High/ Supreme Court. The caller claims that I was issued a Summon or have been summoned by the Court, and requested me to press on '9' for more details. My family were around me back then, and having heard news about the recent Court scam calls news, asked me to immediately end the call, which I did. I then did my research, and am aware that I have just received a scam call. ANY LOSS: I HAD NO ACTUAL LOSS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ETC, SO I HAVE YET TO MAKE A POLICE REPORT. FYI: I also had an experience RECEIVING a scam message from a self-claimed bank (number: 31594622) under a realistic name "smsalert". what happened in the end: I later verified/ did my research with actual DBS, and they have kindly assured me that it was nothing but a scam message. SOme tips that might be helpful 1. BANK WILL NOT ASK FOR YOUR ATM CARD DETAILS OVER PHONE! 2. NEVER CARELESSLY SHARE YOUR BANK DETAILS/ FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND PERSONAL INFORMATION OVER PHONE! Hopefully less people, especially the elderly and the vulnerable, will get scammed in the future and Thanks everyone for the effort in helping to combat scams, let's do our best to help raise awareness!

This person by the name marian franco stephanie reached out to me through meetup group, saying that she wants to be friend and wanted to talk to me via Whatsapp as she is from ny and coming to sg for work and possibly looking at signing a contract in Singapore soon. The number this person reached out is +1(217)5164789. Within a few days of messaging, she said she was coming to singapore through a private jet and would be here for 3 days for contract and job interview which amounted to millions. She started asking all personal questions and started sending inappropriate pics, which I later realised when I googled that this person is taking stealing the pictures from a model instagram page name marian franco who is from mexico. She claimed to return back to ny and asked for help to pay her real-estate agent about S$3000 and she wanted to end it once she is back to sg permanently for her work. She also sent a fake contract. When I challenged on the address given on the contract, the person put it onto the agent and said that's why she needed help as she couldn’t trust the agent if they are legitimate. Later she came back with an excuse saying she found another property and asked me to contact the agent @ +65858925?? and pay him the money and take the key from him. I got bit afraid as the address she shared this time is just within a mile of my house.I politely asked her to back off any not message me again. While i reported the number on whatsapp, i'm not sure if i shall be making a police report as it's bit scary if this person is actually tracking me physically. Beware friends!

I did not lost anything right now.
Received a text saying a parcel addressed to me was stopped and I had to pay shipping fees. When i clicked on the link, I did not recognise the courier service and I got suspicious when there were no specific details on what item it was. At the end, I was prompted to key in my card number for payment, which i didn’t do. Website looks very legit, so I hope this wont fool anyone! The website that I was re-redirected to was called “TRACK AND TRACE” and later i was re-redirected to another website - quizine.s?.
Got an automated call from a singapore mobile number saying that my DBS account has been frozen and that I had to press number “3” to proceed further. I hung the call as felt highly suspicious as bank never calls for these purposes unless I personally raised complaint.
I got this call around 5pm on 3 july 2020. one lady (Accent chinese/thAi/vietNam/korean) Told that my computer is hacked and is currently used for illegal purpose. I asked her how many operating systems were installed on my PC. She then said she will pass this info to her “senior officer”. A more mature lady agian with same accent started to say the same story. I told her, I was an IT expert, and that I would have known it well before anyone else would.
Lady with heavy Indian accent, claimed to be singtel called to inform there are unusual usage of My Wifi These few days. Requested me to turn on computer so that She can Guide on troubleshooting. I asked for verification she said she can provide me with her employee id. told her i do not have computer at home and she replied rudely that I was lying. I simply hung up.
I received a whatsapp audio call from the number +92 306 8664215 and the person from other end told that he is calling from dbs branch. The contact number had DBS/POSB picture as a profile picture . The person claimed that my account is locked and if i give my ATM card number and pin he will unlock. I disconnected the call immediately. Kindly take the necessary steps to make the people aware of these scammers. From the country code of the phone number the guy called from Pakistan.
Lady caller (heavy indian accent) called my wife hp to inform that our Singtel internet service is being hacked. she mentioned that there were many intrusion attempts into our home internet connection. caller introduce herself as an employee from singtel technical department and would like to verify our connection details via a CLS ID which she provided. she then told my wife to access a pc connected to our home internet so that she can guide us step by step to verify our connection status and to take steps to protect ourselves from getting unwanted internet intrusions. We comply just to see where she is going with this steps. She tells us to access a pc and press the windows+R key. We know that this will bring up the run box to enter commands. fortunately we do not have a windows pc at home, explained as such and she tried to refer us to a senior technician. At this point we had enough info to log a SCAM and so we put down the phone. Main reasons we think this is a scam is because: our internet account is not under my wife's name we have never been told to provide a ID number before she was unable to identify our singtel account number for verification she tried to get us to run a command on our pc
A female called my mobile number indicating that she's calling from Singtel maintenance/cyber SECURITY claiming that there are SUSPICIOUS/UNAUTHORIZED persons using my singtel internet connection and need to remove it immediately. saying that my credit card/bank details might be compromised and they cant fix it on their end. sounded like indian national. requested that i key in this certain ID to check. when asked, she even provided the singtel number 6562351688 to call to confirm that this call was genuine after checking with people around her. i also asked why is she calling from from such a "weird" number, her reply was that this a an internet call so that's why it's like that. kept saying that this is urgent that's why they need to call you directly. Hung up after I said I would call singtel directly to confirm.
Was looking for part-time work when i saw a listing on carousell asking for someone to do a simple task, sign a phone contract and receive a reimbursement. happened somewhere in september 2019. Claimed they will settle the bill and took the phone and sim card and left. Now it is july 2020 and I am left with no cash transfer, a huge telco bill sum that i will have to pay and the person is no where to be found. Be careful and don't sign any contracts on behalf of others!
I was approached by a lady from china who goes by the name "jiang lin" on wechat. She claims to be from a well-to-do family from beijing and has an "uncle" who is a financial expert.After a couple of text exchanges she introduced me to invest in a cryptocurrency known as "obb", trading on a cryptocurrency online platform known as "bftbit" (www.bftbit.com). Bftbit turns out to be a fake trading platform and obb is a non-existent cryptocurrency. Once monies are deposited into bftbit it goes directly to the scammers, although on bftbit it reflects as deposited into your bftbit account and no matter how you try to withdraw the monies, the withdrawal status would remain as "processing".In the beginning i was very skeptical and refused to believe her. But a moment of greed and "too smart for my own good" led me to foolishly believe in her and lost an unrecoverable sum of s$14,500.The modus operandi:1) she would first introduce that she had been into this obb investment for 3 years under the guidance of her financial expert uncle who guides her to invest at the relevant time on bftbit which most of the time would be profit-making as the uncle knows the market.2) she would ask you to invest in a small sum of us$500 first which would make profits after 2 rounds of investment on bftbit. She would also provide step-by-step guidance [i.e. buying of cryptocurrency on huobi (an authentic ans well-known cryptocurrency exchange incorporated in singapore), transferring of currency from huobi to bftbit, making trades in obb on bftbit and withdrawal and transferring of a small sum of currency from bftbit to huobi (this withdrawal is to make one believe that bftbit is an authentic trading platform but in fact the withdrawal is done by the scammers)]. From there, she would entice you to invest in us$10,000 as her uncle predicts that a big market trend is coming, thus earning more profit.3) she would then suggest to make a joint trade of usd$20,000 which would require us$30,000 as security deposit. In order to gain your trust, she would transfer us$40,000 into your bftbit account. Once you transfer your us$10,000 into the account it is gone forever.4) at the time when you (and her) are jointly trading on the obb big market trend, the trading system would stop for unknown reason and when you refresh the trading system you would realise that the joint trade suffers an 80% loss. From there, she would claim to be your fault and ask for refund of her us$40,000.5) a much serious concern is that in setting up your account with bftbit you need to furnish a copy of your nric which is at the scammers' disposal.
I just want to inform and be aware of this number +65 6599 8004. The guy (sound Like an Indian) claims that he is from singtel and my Internet is being hacked and misused by Other. But I do not uses singtel operator for my Internet. He claims singtel is in control of the whole Singapore Internet. I immediately end the call as I feel something suspicious.
a person called at 8 a.m. informing that she called from singtel and saying that there is some error message regarding to the wifi/internet connection which required me to switch off my laptop and follow her instruction. so I asked the name and department so I would make a call back. name given is jean goh or something (it was not clear) from singtel technical department.
The caller claimed to be from DBS, claimed that there was issues with my ATM card, that there are changes to my NRIC which I didn't update them. Hence, he asked for my nric. Beware of this scam!! they used Whatsapp call, and even mis-using DBS logo in their profile picture. These scammers are annoying. be careful people!!
I was aware of indian caller scams from youtube videos that happened in the USA. So i did not fall for the scam. They called my home number first and then my personal number. I hope you can alert via facebook or any way for the public to know that this indian scammers are now calling singapore residents.
An Indian nationalist claimed to be from Singtel and mentioned that he is here to help me with my internet connection with Singtel. He called using the following number: ‭+65 9888 5032‬ He asked if I was using a windows or Mac and wanted to guide me to fix something on the computer and pretended to transfer the call to another department. I found the the whole situation so suspicious and ended the call.
met a girl through Tinder and proceed to Whatsapp. After chatting for a while, she asked if we wanted to do a video call to chat. I was bored so I agreed. shortly after the chat did get a bit flirty and then we proceed to get butt naked over the video call. shortly after she ended the call and said it was laggy, so she sent a link (DO NOT FALL FOR THIS) and said why not we chat at her private room. To login, is to put your number and the room number of hers. Stupidly I did it and shortly after she sent a video saying it got recorded and threaten to send it to my family and friends. the "manager" later called and threatened to send if I don't transfer money to him now. I did not even have the time to react or to think. but luckily I managed to negotiate not to send the full amount. but still, money was still lost in the process. If you received such threats, just block their numbers straight away and just ignore. Yes, I know you are afraid that they might send cos I was in the same situation as you. But just make a police report and block their numbers. because I believe even if you send the full amount, they will demand more. It's never-ending, I was lucky that I negotiated to only send half over. Brothers, I understand the needs or desires that we fall into. but learn from my mistake, don't do online video call ever. Even if the girl seems genuine. Cos mine did too. And I admit I had some indecent video calls before but I never thought I would be a victim of this. Never get complacent. if their number ever starts with +852 esp, do not contact them ever.
At 29 June 2020, SGT 2.24pm. I received 1 call on my whatsapp. The caller had the DBS paylah logo as his avatar with an Indian male on the line claiming to be from dbs paylah. i believe he was asking for my personal details as i could not make out what he was saying; so i hung up the call. i received a second call less than 5 minutes later, with the same guy explaining that he is from dbs paylah. once again, as i could not fully understand what he was saying, i asked for him to reconfirm the details. he did not, and started pressing me for my nric and banking details; so i hung up a second time. The caller mentioned something along the lines of my "Paylah" account was going to be deactivated after some time and he needed my NRIC to confirm if it was mine. I hung up immediately.
I was just doing my own business and the phone rang. There was a brief silence and a lot of 'hello-ing' back and forth. Then she said, with a thick Indian accent, 'Hi, i am calling from singtel regarding the intermittent connectivity issues.'. It's true that I was facing some issues but seeing that number and that telecos don't make such unsolicited phone calls telling their customers that they have issues with their internet, I hung up.
i received a scam/spam call from this number +65 98885032 asking for details about my singtel internet connection. I'm not even a subscriber of any singnet/singtel services. So, I ended the call. I thought it would be great to share my experience here to warn others of this scam.

Please do not fall to such scam and do not be afraid when threatened

A woman with a strong indian accent called to say she was from singtel, and that they had noted unusual downloads on my home wifi, and said they suspected people have illegally hacked my wifi. Said there were many downloads. I told her that i am not a subscriber to singtel - her glib reply was that all internet in singapore is under singtel. She then asked me to turn on my computer so that i could see the illegal internet traffic. I said no, then hung up. I called starhub to verify this. They said that they have received many calls on this and asked me to visit scam alert website to report it. Be very careful! Lots of scammers out there these days.

I got to know jerry cheung from tantan apps, we move on to wechat to continue for chatting. Like a similar story shared, he told me that he is a Russian, i knew her start from august 2019. That's how we start our "love story" I lost a lot of money. The worse case is when i cannot continue to supply him the money, he tried to threaten me. first time he requested the money, is when he said the building he erected is collapsed. asked the money from me for around EUR5000 to rescue him. i paid him with doubt, i cannot search any similar story or name online. few weeks later, the victims in the collapsed building die. the victim family asked for compensation, for EUR20,000. He said he has a very good lawyer to represent him. the lawyer paid EUR15,000 and i only need to pay eur5000 so that he can go back to russia and start his life again. after a very long time dragging between us, i "help" him again. one weeks later, the victim uncle came back from china, and said the earlier compensation is not suffcient. they asked for another EUR15,000 (if i not mistaken), the lawyer paid EUR8000 and i top up another EUR7000. how stupid i am is i still help him with EUR5000. he can anytime spam me, ask the money from me, cry in the phone call, etc. this is not the end of the story. few days later, he suddenly missing. the 'lawyer' start to appear in the story. the lawyer said the day when he was at the airport and waiting for the departure, airport staffs found there is drugs in his bag. and he dunno how this could happened. The lawyer told me, we can rescue him by paying money to the Indonesian authority. he got the 'lubang' where all these can settle under table. Asked for USD20,000 from me to rescue him. I told him that i won't pay him. he show me the photo with the prison wear. I've told him that I won't pay as I don't have the money anymore. few days later, he said if i dun pay, he will inform the indonesia authority that i will get involve with the drug case as well. He said he would do something nasty to me. When I felt that my life is being threaten at that time, and i make the police report at that night. I was vulnerable when I got into a relationship with him and I hope that my story can help alert the other ladies out there in search of love online. To all the ladies out there, please don't trust other people easily.
Received a scam call from a guy with a strong foreign accent, claiming to be from "Singtel" technician. He said that they received a warning of unidentified ip addresses being found from my internet (smth like that) and it is an issue that needs to be fixed asap. Which sounded legit at first - but then He told me to open up my computer and download 'teamviewer' and i started being suspicious because that's a screen sharing app. i immediately told him that i need to run for a meeting, and to reschedule if need be (to entertain him LOL). then hung up. i called singtel to verify and they advice to not pick up such calls. also: 1. SIngtel only calls for plan &amp; billing matters 2. Anything else is we call first be aware guys!
A number starting with +9 called me. Without looking, i thought it was an sg mobile number. the caller identified himself from singtel and that there has been abnormally high use of data on my home wifi for the past few days. this indicates a possible hack to my home wifi and singtel noticed that there were more than 20 uses for my wifi. as the first step, he needed us to verify our home wifi number. he guided us on the computer to a DOS command screen to type in some simple commands. he then read out this set of info - 888DCA60-FC0A-11CF-8F0F-00C04FD7D0?? - which is also on our screen. This helped him prove that he's from Singtel (as only singtel has this info about my home wifi). to work with us to troubleshoot the hacking. He then asked for our confidential information like nric number, wifi password and router number. We started our search online and found that this is a scam. We immediately ended the call. Be careful everyone!
The lady named sussane called twice. The first number displayed was ‭+7 (293) 204-93-5‬. Said that my network was seeing high traffic and under cyber attack. Second number ‭+1 (221) 969-842‬. Beware and do not respond to callers who claim that your internet has "issues".
AT 10AM SGT on 22nd June 20 the scammer called from +65 6721 0127 impersonating a singtel helpdesk agent. Here's their plot: 1. They inform that there's a high internet traffic from your house/some error messages from the router. 2. The agent asks some convincing questions like (a) have you shared your password with neighbours, etc (B) have you noticed buffering in your internet videos, etc. To both their questions my response was "what do you want me to do?". Eventually they mentioned I need to login to my router using a computer and perform a couple of steps. I replied I won't be doing that. The scammer immediately disconnected. I'M NOT EVEN A SINGTEL SUBSCRIBER, BUT WANTED TO PLAY ALONG TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE UP TO. Beware: With access to your home router, they will have access to every network connected device in your house! Even if you feel the call is legitimate, please disconnect and call your ISP's hotline number to validate the complain. Every day these scammers come up with new ways to steal HARD EARNED MONEY from unsuspecting individuals.
I received a call from a SG number and there was a woman with a Filipino accent requesting for information on the router stating that there was a recurring error message on their end and needed us to use a computer to fix it. She sounded quite professional, however, when asked to send a technician instead, she said that they will send an email regarding this and hung up (didn't take the email address).
1) - match zhenxi via tinder. She started the conversation but will soon divert the conversation to wechat, asking me to add her.She will share that she’s someone who travels around often maintaining her trading business based in guangzhou shenzhen. She will come off as someone who is financially capable, emphasizing her knowledge in investing as a side business to maintain the high standard of livings there.For the first few days, she would attempt to phish for personal information (location, salary, interest, investment knowledge, close relatives). Slowly, the conversation will progress to how she and her friend invest during their free time and earning fast bucks. Never in the conversation would she encourage you to join in investing, nor would she ask you to lend her money. When you ask for more info, she would offer her help for free to teach you how to invest. Next, she would direct you to this 'trading platform' (ccysu?.com), which shows a dashboard with various currency exchange and a crypto-coin. She asked to set up an account, and from there will send you another wechat account (trading platform support contact), asking you to seek advice from there for information of transfer of funds to the platform. The platform consultant will then send you a local account information of transfer of funds. Sometimes another account number will be given if the you mentioned the transferring amount is substantial. Platform consultant as sop will direct you a company's link and prove that they are a global customer. A smart move so that if anything happens, the blame would be on the platform, not the girl. 3) personal info, money, time and effort all will be lost if one is to fall for this trap. I can only assume that you can 'trade' on the platform for the first couple of days or weeks since the scammer is only asking for a small amount of money to be invested initially. The platform is fake, so an easily manipulated bear chart will have you keep buying in for cost averaging down, unknowingly pumping in more money to the 'platform'.To add, I believe is critical to continue the conversation even when realising that it is a scam. This way, counter scamming would enable us to phish more details from scammers and their operating sop. To that end of course never transfer any money or personal info to achieve it.

Went online shopping in shopee on 20 june 2020 and found this sg seller. item was offered at $350 with no delivery fee required. I contact seller through whatsapp (83792917) and He counter offer at $300 and told us to make a direct bank transfer. i worried this is a scam so he offer a deposit of $200 instead, he even provide me with an NRIC (both side copy) to make me feel safe. coming to think of it now, the nric must have belong to some other victim as well. anyway, story is, i transfer the $200 to posb-??8032065 and was told to contact his boss for the item. through whatsapp (83022302) with the boss, he told me to make the remaining payment if we want to get the item cos his staff is new and not too sure of the procedure. once again, $100 was transfer, this time to another bank account (posb-??6470451). then we are told that we need to make another payment of $100 as delivery fee. only then, did i realise this is a scam... i confront the boss, as usual it is pointless, then i told him i wanted a refund... of cos there is no refund so my money is gone... I wish to raise awareness and hope it will help to prevent you from falling into similiar case or being cheated by the same scammer. There are 2 person in incident who cheated me of a total of $300.
A call came at 12.10pm on 21 jun 2020 from +65 62024526 impersonating DBS in mandarin. Message mentioned that it had an urgent message for me. I hung up immediately &amp; blocked the caller.
They posted adverts on Facebook for iphones and other electronics at very low prices. When they received private messages for inquiries, they would request to communicate via whatsapp. 1. stated during june 20th that due to covid 19 situation they are unable to do store collection, which is funny because phrase two already started. 2. asked for 50% deposit into their company bank account instead of full cash on delivery. Conclusion: Scammers will lure you with unbelievably low prices on e-commerce sites! Beware!
Met the guy on a dating website. Very quickly, he asked for us to be in a relationship. Professing love and care. Saying he will come over to visit from scotland and his mother was in singapore.

I received a call from someone claiming is from Singtel to check on my internet router but my broadband/wifi is from starhub so i questioned the person why will i receive a call from singtel when i buy from starhub. she mentioned that starhub authorised singtel to check with customers on wifi issues. she also mentioned there have been unauthorised person using my ip address for the past few days. she then ask to speak to my dad who was the person who subscribed the broadband and requested to come down to take change our router. my dad found this very suspicious and asked her to write an official email requesting this and ended the call immediately.
Caller claimed from Singtel internet provider (I'm using Starhub). He shared that many unauthorized users were using my internet. Said will help me to resolve the issue and ask me to check on laptop netstat on internet activities. Highlighted that many foreign IPs were detected. Put me to his supervisor to help celar the unauthorized users. Supervisor asked me to download anydesk.com to access my laptop... Found it fishy, due to background road noise, wrong internet subscriber... Hang up and call starhub to verify.
The caller claim to be a network security specialist calling from "Microsoft Network" security. They claimed that your home network is being compromised by hacker and the hackers can access your computer to steal information. In order for you to believe them they will ask you to open the program command prompt for windows or terminal for mac. They will ask you type netstat and hit enter. Upon doing that, you will see a list of active internet connections. the caller will claim that these are the foreigner addresses now accessing your computer. they will ask you to connect to their secure server to allow them to remotely access to your computer. Do not give anyone remote access to your computer as this would allow them to access info saved on your computer or monitor what you are doing!

A lady caller by the name of "Olivia" called to say that she is from Starhub. She claimed that the company had detected some people using my internet to do some illegal stuff. She also claimed that they are trying to resolve the issue and would require me to turn on my laptop to do so. I told her that i can only use an ipad now and she had trouble tryIng to find a solution, so she cut the line and got another person to call me. I told them that i will call Starhub on my own to find out and they insisted that they are from starhub. I told them that i do not believe so and would check with starhub directly, which i did and starhub referred me to the scam hotline, which was full. Therefore i’m leaving a message here. Thanks.

My wife received a call on 17th june 2020 at about 8.30am. the guy, with an indian accent, introduced himself as martin and was calling from singtel technical office. he told my wife that someone had used our internet connection behind our back to do illegal things. he wanted us to login to our desktop/laptop and he would remotely teach us how to secure our internet connection. he kept repeating that he's from singtel and was trying to help us secure our internet connection. sensing something amiss, we probed him to check if he is genuinely a singtel technical staff. Upon our probing, he immediately cut off the call. subsequently we called up singtel and was told that they will not actively call up customers to notify about internet issues. most of the time, internet problems were raised by customers instead.
Some guy with a middle-eastern accent said he was from singtel, and he had to update my router. asked for my router details, which made me suspicious so I asked him to verify that he was from singtel. he gave me a long ALPHA-NUMERAL code and said this is my singtel id for my internet. he then asked me to go into my computer command prompt for him to give me instruction on how to check my internet code and to update my router. Anyway, I asked him to give me my full name or that was registered with singtel to prove that he is from singtel. He gave the wrong name. so I told him he got the wrong number and not to call me again.
This lady with a south-Asian / middle-eastern accent called with this international number to my office line. I thought that it was a work call and picked it up. She introduced herself as calling from Singtel and wanted to talk to me about my internet connection issues. I have been working from home for a while now, and my home internet is from another Telco company and is not under my name. My office is using Singtel, but nobody is there using the internet and I am not the person listed as a contact for internet issues. Therefore I thought her calling me was weird. I told her that I don't use Singtel, and she said "Yeah I know, but let me tell you about Singtel. Singtel is the mother internet provider for whole of Singapore..." before she could finish I just cut off the call. It was so obviously a scam and a waste of time. Beware, people!! I checked the number and based on the country code, the call is from Kazakhstan. I don't think Singtel has a base there and would direct my internet connection issues to an overseas call centre. They probably didn't think I'd see the number because she called a land-line. So be careful if you can't see the caller ID! Ask questions to verify before providing any information! besides, she doesn't even know my name!
I received a call from a man who claimed he was from from singtel. He did not address me and only said that there was a problem with my internet connect these few days, he could see IT from his end. When I told him that I wasn't a Singtel user, he hung up.
I met him on Tinder. we chatted for awhile there before moving to whatsapp. he was nice, decent and very respectful. he called me briefly after a week of chatting and asked me to call back in 2 hours time. but he never answered my call and only apologised for missing the call (But never called back) two weeks of chatting he said he is interested in me and looking forward to meeting post circuit breaker. there was not a single suspicion that he is a love scammer/fake person as he has never asked anything other than my photos. i questioned him for not having a video call and he said i was unstable and went missing for few days but he replied when i reached out to him - we reconnected and things get better. he declared his love and always wrote me nice words to start my day. we have planned to meet now that phase 2 is coming soon, he suggested his place so he can cook for us. our chat turned flirty once or twice and then back to normal. although we chatted less, the quality of the conversation got better. he left me a 'good night and sweet dreams Bae' with a heart emoticon on midnight, i replied in the morning and i didn't hear anything anymore. the following day he was no longer there and his number (digital phone number) belongs to someone else out of singapore now. i don't know the intention of the communication - i may not lose anything material but my emotional is really affected by this encounter. it has been almost a week but i still couldn't move on - what actually happened? this is a question i will never get the answer on. Be careful with whom you are talking to online and if the person expresses his affection for you very early on, something is WRONG! Don't get affected like me.
RECEIVED A CALL AT 1.05PM ON 17/6/2020, AND AFTER THE CALL I Saw a user on this website share the exact same experience i had, but with a different phone number (63380970),: "A lady with strong Indian accent called me to say that she was from SINGTEL, calling to create awareness and they have detected abnormal behaviour from a third party accessing my internet. she had ASKED me to go to my laptop in order for her to help." I was asked if I was experiencing any technically difficulties lately and was told to check my internet modem to see how many lights were flashing. I asked her what my modem number was because i was feeling rather skeptical, and she instantly hung up. would advise you guys to ask for specific details that only a legitimate company can answer to make sure it is not a scam.
A guy claimed that he's calling from DBS and mentioned that my account is going to be suspended if i don't update my NRIC number. I requested to update the information myself online but he claimed that it can only be done at his end. after around 20 minutes of back and forth discussion whether this is a scam call, somehow he persuaded me that he's really from DBS by sending out a message from mom. after that, i was asked to give out my internet banking user id, which i did unfortunately. then he told me that he would transfer the call out for password verification. i was told to speak out my password to a machine (a recorded sound, which may not be a transferred call come to think about it), which I did as well unfortunately. then he told me that he's going to update my details and kept giving me update on the % of the progress. i have been suspicious since the beginning, but somehow he managed to lead me to give him 3 times of otp without allowing me time to check through my emails and messages from dbs. i came to notice that someone is trying to make transactions from my account and dropped the call to call posb right away when finally got chance to read my messages. the guy successfully transferred money from my account twice, both time around $7k each.

A guy with an accent called me (his mobile number: 91412513) and identified himself as "Singtel" representative from the IT department. I asked what is this called about? He replied saying that it is regarding my singtel internet connectivity issue. I told him that the thing is i am not singtel subscriber. then he straight away hang up my call. I googling from the internet and found out that someone also received similar phone call from the same mobile number before and it's a scam. Hence, i decided to share my story to make sure everyone is aware of this type of scam.
I received a phone call from someone claiming to be from singtel, saying that i had a "very serious issue" with my internet.The caller had a strong Indian accent, and could not provide further details when probed. The connection was also very bad and I could barely hear him. I did not respond and he hung up soon after.
Someone called with indian accent, say his name is stephen and he is calling from singtel, i told him " sorry i think you got the wrong number as i am not using sintel service, he then pause for about 5 seconds and reply " dear sir, as you know Singtel is the only main provider in Singapore and the rest of the service provider like Starhub and M1 are sub-vendor of singtel....etc etc, i "told him i not interested in change service provider thank you", he then reply "actually we are just calling to check internet speed", i replied i do not have any speed issue all is fine", he say " just doing some normal checks, can you check you router and tell me your IP" after hearing this i just hung up.
I received a call this morning (16 june 2020 at 8,35am) on my mobile. the number reflected is +65 9533 9068. the caller informed me he is an employee of singtel who is tasked to follow up on my internet connectivity as the service provider had detected a number of illegal foreign connections over the past 2 weeks. he asked me to turn on my laptop and gave instructions so i could access the ip address report of illegal logins. he also asked me to provide details on what I could view on my screen. to verify his identity, I asked him to provide details of my registered home address. but he claimed he is from the technical team and has no access to customers' info (but he is able to call my mobile). I asked him to provide his staff info so I could call singtel to verify his identity. he gave his name as john Williamson (he has a strong native Indian accent though) and his employee number SNGT0269. he requested to be put on hold while I call singtel to check, but I ask for his number instead. he claimed he is on satellite call and to call him back, I need to dial 800 492 2408 followed by #101. After calling singtel, I discovered the call was a scam. there was no financial of info loss.
caller identified himself as a singtel representative. called me to say someone is using my internet without my knowledge. Could not answer basic questions - and hung up when questioned. Indian person with a fake American accent.
This call came as an agent from Singtel saying my internet connection has issues. I've continue to call to get details from the caller as much as possible. SCam phone number : +65 95510512 First there was a lady called, and tried to prove that I've internet issues by asking me to open command prompt and running "netstat" command. Since, I speak as I've convinced, Then the call was transferred to a male person. He tried to install below application to get remote access. https://www.teamviewer.com/en/ https://www.iperiusremote.com/ https://anydesk.com/en This is all I was manage to get and I had to hang the after half an hour as I could get nothing without installing the remote desktop application.
Received a call from a scammer saying that someone is using my singtel internet to do ILLEGAL business. what they don't know my ISP is myrepublic. I can tell that they are using a VOIP to spoof call a local number because there is lag when I respond to them. Also, calling the number back, returns an invalid number. A quick search shows that they are spoofing a singtel number. Another sign that this is a scam is both persons I spoke to were indian men with generic english names like John. this is a dead give away that they are a scam center located in india. do your research, there is a huge wave of indian scammers that will try their luck on unsuspecting people who might not know what is going on with their internet providers. wasted his time by pretending to not know how to use my computer. Take note of these scammers as they will try to get you to most probably get you to log onto their website and steal your credit card details or get you to pay money. To anyone reading this, do Understand that ISP and telcos will never call you using a handphone number. If someone you don't know asks for your personal details or ask you to download some programmes, don't do it.
Received a "Singtel" impersonation scam call. Purportedly, Singtel staff called my mobile from a mobile line that I did not recognise. He spoke eloquently, with indian accent. he claimed he called as they detected unauthorised use of my internet connection in recent days. i said i did not report any unauthorised use, told him he was a scammer and hung up.
The call just claim that she noted my internet have issued and not stable. And immediately i am alert straight away from the scam call. 1st of all, she don't sound professional. Plus singtel technical won't make unsolicited phone calls to their customers if we never make a report on technical issues.
It was an automated voice call from "DBS'. it was in Mandarin, which was really suspicious. And the person called from a handphone number. I hanged up because it sounded too scammy.
received a phone call stating she is from Singtel and that my internet has been misused by someone which at this point i already know its a scam and i just continue to play along. after which i got a call transfer to another guy. he ask me to boot into my computer and follow his instructions: *****Waring! please do not proceed if you do not know what you are doing***** 1. winows key + R 2. CMD (Command Prompt) 3. Netstat 4. EVentVWR 5. visit www.anydesk.com to download the remote desktop so at this point i did not visit the site because there may be viruses. and i confronted and later he disconnected the call.
Received call on whatsapp from the above number. The person claimed to be from POSB bank and said that my account is locked as I have not updated details. i knew its a scam as the number was a US number and call was on Whatsapp. They ended the call when they found out that I knew it was a scam call. Scammer number: 14388345387
I received a phone call from someone who claimed to be from Singtel. He claimed to be a technician who is checking on my singtel broadband connection as he received anomalies on the broadband connections. He gave his name as 'Alex murphy', but spoke with a strong indian accent. I asked for this identification number but he randomly gave 3 letters and 4 digits as the number. I told him that i would call Singtel to check his identity, and he even dared me to do it. Upon finding out that I am not a singtel broadband subscriber, he hung up the call.
I was looking for a part time job and I came across their listing to be a part time cashier personal assistance from home. my job was to receive funds from sales rep and keep records. it didn't suspect anything until they asked me for account number so that customers will transfer to my account. Luckily i checked this website and came across other people who experienced the same thing before it was too late
I met this fraudster on a social network, it was my birthday, and he asked me address, phone and other personal information, to send me a gift, I thought flowers, as romantic as I am. And instead I was contacted to pick up a package of 12 kg, at a cost of $2500 USD. At the payment request I was given an account number sent to me with a strange royal express email &lt;royalexpressdelivery.pcs@gmail.com&gt; : Name : Khiew Tze M?? Account number : ???-5-043407 Bank : OCBC bank Swift Code: OCBCSGSG To be made with an ATM cash payment. Of course I did not do it, the figure is very high, although in the package the crook had later told me to pick it up because it contains, two bags of value, bracelet earrings and necklace, white and yellow gold, a watch and an iphone. Let me say we knew each other for a week. Don't be lured by the "expensive" gift offered by online fried!
two weeks ago i was looking for a job online and i came across this job listing "Home based Personal Assistant" so I whatsapp the number on the listing. The guy told me that the job scope was to receive funds and record transactions from their sales rep. So upon reviewing and approving my CV, he asked for my bank details and I gave it to him. The next day he notified me that a certain amount of money has been credited because of sales. He said I have to record it down and then transfer the money out to another bank account. I just did what he told me to do for the next couple of days AS I thought my main job purpose was to record the transactions. Until 2-3 days later I found out that my bank account had been frozen. I panicked and called the bank, they said my account was under investigation by the police. So I called the police and they told me to go down and give a statement because I am now involved as the account is mine. i hope no one else encounters a case like this because it is horrible. I know nothing about money laundering and nothing about laws and the police so this was very frightening for me.
Just received the call @ 11.52am. The person claimed that he's from the police department and said that my nric was misused and involved in a criminal activity. Pls beware of this impersonation scam!
I almost fell prey to an Internet Love scam. I met on dating app tinder. I got connected to this boy 3 weeks ago, he said he was based in UK and asked me for my WhatsApp number to be able to talk frequently, soon he became very emotional and attached and calling everyday. Last week around 4th June, 2020 I suggested to do a video call over the coming weekend , which he agreed to, however , he did not make it for that virtual date and I was really upset and deleted my tinder profile and his contact from WhatsApp. The next day I was bombarded with calls and texts apologising and promising to make up for it. I was expecting a video call however, I was told that he has bought some gifts for me and would like to send it over. I felt weird and resisted in giving my address for delivery but after bit of persuasion from his end I gave in and provided my email, full name and address to him. The next morning when I woke up I saw his message with the courier receipt stating the parcel weight as 45 kgs. I was in a shock that how can someone send so much stuff, I was also provided the tracking number and saw that the delivery was due on 11th June,2020. I tried asking him what was in the parcel but he said its a surprise, later he called me again to and while chatting he said he has also put in some cash for me to buy something of my own choice. I felt there was something seriously wrong and soon after i.e today at 9:40am I received an email from the shipping company saying parcel has arrived in singapore but is due taxes and import duty of S$4,500 and I need to respond to them about how I will be making a payment. That is when I was sure this is a scam. The persons details as as follow Alex Liwei Wong Contact detail: ++447438029981 Acton Ave 24, Nottingham City UK
I received a call from +65 97112189. An Indian lady was on the line claiming that she's calling from singtel as they observed that there has been more than 20 users connected to my WIFI. She confirmed if she was speaking to the account holder, if we have been facing WIFI issues (which we indeed Have), if we have good password practices, the number of devices we have connected to our wifi. The first time i questioned her identity, she responded that she has been authorised by singtel to follow up with customers with this issue. She then requested for me to use a laptop and follow her instructions to reveal the ip addresses of the unauthorised users. that is when i questioned her identity a second time, given that there was no call from singtel prior to this call and that she was calling from a private mobile number. She then hung up immediately.
'Buyer' claimed to be in usa, and wanted to buy my product to be sent to malaysia. He sent me a paypal email showing that payment was made. but on closer scrutiny, i realised it is a fake image.
Just received a call from someone claiming to be from Singapore Police force and said my NRIC has been misused overseas and I need to file an e-report.

Please be aware and do not entertain these calls. This scam keeps re-emerging, so beware!

The number is a genuine Singapore number and he told now days Singapore is having internet problems and SingTel is checking household broadband to make internet uninterrupted hereafter.

Beware of such scam and if in doubt call Singtel to check and give in to threats!

Scammers claimed to be from "DBS BANK" Obviously, their English sounded 100% from mainland China
So I thought with this circuit breaker, this can be an opportunity for me to make new friends and expand my dating scene. So i tried tinder and got matched with a couple of guys. The standard MO is get your whatsapp number, then start chatting with you, and very quickly "falling in love" with you. standard sob stories are: 1. wife died in an accident (don't want to talk about it) 2. only child with a very old grandmother 3. only child with a very strong single mother all have local numbers, mostly registered as business whatsapp numbers. as time goes by, you will notice cracks in their stories (for example - pictures can be found online, and like they probably stole other people's profiles during their other scams and used it for the chat) can't meet because their phone camera's don't work, spoilt, would call you to appease you. may sound foreign but if you listen carefully, you will hear either a recorded bot. they might work in groups - some might be smarter than others in terms of their playbook Language - grammar and spelling are really bad (especially if they say they are professionals and westerners) Will ask you tons of questions but will never answer yours. so will ask about family, work, are you single, and are you living alone. and they will shape their answers to you based on your answers to prove that you two match and connect. Just pay attention, do your research, avoid sharing too much until you meet them. Someone should write to these dating apps and ask them to seriously review their member verification process. #justsaying Doesn't matter what app - tinder, coffee whatever bagel, the league - they will create whatever profile and pretend to be real. the key thing is use your gut feel and also your EQ/IQ - be smart. Good luck!
I got a call from this number and the person claims to be from Singtel. Started asking me to go in front of my router to check if the lights are working. The audio was a little robotic with an Indian accent. Ended the call because the number they reach me now should not be the one that actual company call me on in regards to the network
was chatting with a guy met through cmb. he introduced me to this investment app GSGJ (short for 高盛国际). The suspicious thing about this investment app is that the deposit account keeps changing and i asked the customer service why..they said the account will always be full. but i suspect they keep changing the account number to avoid being caught in the act. the guy whom intro me also keep hurrying me to transfer the funds. with sweet talks along the way. contacts involved &gt;&gt; +852 5574 8351 and +65 8923 0710. bank account &gt;&gt; standard chartered ??09840571
I received a call from tel no: +65 68145126. Caller speak with indian accent claimed to be from Singtel and there is problem with my internet. At once i knew it's a scam call and cut off the line and block the call as Singtel don't call from personal hp. Furthermore, this is the second time I received scam call from "Singtel".Please beware of this scam. Editor’s Note: Scammers are using spoofing technology to create fake numbers and numbers shown on users’ Caller ID are mostly fake, defunct numbers or belong to some innocent parties who didn’t make these calls. The best and most effective measure is to be able to recognise the red flags of a scam call and not fall prey to it. Since April 2020, all incoming calls that originate from overseas will come with the + prefix.
Caller from "internet service provider" sounded really suspicious. I received a call from 92377294 and a woman with strong indian accent claiming to be from my internet service provider TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM SAID my internet is vulnerable to hackers attack. i hung up immediately without giving further details.
A caller by the name mike with a strong indian accent called me. He mentioned they are calling from singtel technical team and they aware that there are some illegal devices connected to my internet connection. Said that they are helping to block them from accessing the internet. First they ask me to login to the computer and do 'netstat' command to see connected devices. Then they ask me to download the remote desktop software from 'anydesk.com'. At this point, I stopped and told that singtel does not typically require to connect to my computer via a remote desktop software. And informed that i will report this to singtel. I informed this to singtel with the phone number they used for calling (96511302).
Ladies/gentlman please be careful when you use online dating apps especially with the recent increasing number of china profile in dating apps. This kind of scam is called 杀猪盘 in china. You guys can go baidu it and will have more horror scam stories. Please share with your family/peers/friends/relatives because you will never know if they are going to be the next victim-to-be. This can happened to female and male so just take note! These are the signs 1. Their introduction/bio will be quite short or very sweet. E.g 我相信一见钟情 that kind of bull shit. They will also state that they are in singapore for a short work trip or etc. 2. They will put selfie in their profile so you kinda believe that they are "real". However, they aren't! They are cat fishing and probably take those pictures from online. 3. Talk in wechat/telegram/whatsapp normally, after a while, they will ask you to talk in wechat/whatsapp/telegram. I guess it is easier for them to reply after all... They need to reply to 101 potential victims. 4.they are sweet at talking and make you feel awwwww! 5. Talk about finances/investment and show you their winnings. Sometimes, they will talk about finances/investment or what adults should be financially independent to have a better future. They will start to show you their winnings and tempt you to join them 6. You don't need to transfer him money at all, just create an account 7. The scammer will make you believe that you are earning and able to withdraw the earnings (i read from baidu) and put in more money and more money. Then one day "puff" they mia. After my incident happened, i tried to google online for this scam in singapore but i couldn't seem to find any cases. Back then, i didn't know that it is call 杀猪盘 either so i did not read up more. I did told some of my friends and one of them (their friend friend friend - super distant) had this encounter as well. I believe there are some people who might have gotten scammed but did not voice up or don't know where to voice up. With the recent increasing china profile in dating apps, i really urged everyone to inform their loved ones and friends - not to fall for it! It is really sad to get scammed. With that, i hope everyone stay safe and becareful in both offline and online world!

I received a call from 91173277 and a woman with strong indian accent claiming to be from singtel TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM SAID I supposedly had many illegal devices connected on my internet and I needed to block them. Beware!
the caller called my mobile and said he was from singtel. he said that my home internet speed is slow due to unauthorised used of my home internet. he asked my to turn on my computer so that he could assist me. suspicious, i asked for his name which he refused. he offered to give me his employee id. then i asked him what my name is and he declined to disclose it as he said it was confidential. i said if he could not provide his proper singtel identity then how would i know if he was real. i continued to press him for his name, his phone and email so that i could call him back to verify. he said "JOHN"...and then he hung up. Never trust anyone who cannot properly identify themselves over the phone. a legitimate caller from the company would not hesitate to offer you their name and contact so that you can call them back to verify. even then, you should always be alert that they should be identifying you correctly. in case of doubt, always hang up and call back the organisation/company which is supposed to be the caller to verify. stay safe!

Met a guy name Christopher Zhang on okc in april. After a few messages, he requested to move to whatsapp and will delete account on okc.He said he moved from hong kong to scotland at 3 years old when his dad passed away. He now lives in Glasgow, work as a mechanical engineer and owns a small company. His Whatsapp number are +44 7475 902334 and +44 7395 346368 (business account) but he might have more than 2 numbers.Every day, we would message. He said he loves me but he refused to do video calls. He said he would like to send me a present because he doesn’t know when this pandemic would be over so at least I could have a physical item that could remind me of him.I already suspected that he is a scammer through his texts. Sometimes he would use American english and sometimes British english. So, I turned him down. He then got annoyed and I stopped messaging him.He seems to appear in the following two stories:1) https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/story-30mar2018211544pm2) https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/story-17may2020151652pm
I sent message to Lazada seller on chat about the detail of oneplus cellphone. He replied that he sent the detail to me by whatsapp, so i told him my whatsapp contact number. He requested me to do bank transfer for purchase and said that he did delivery and sent me the invoice receipt once i sent money. I didn't trust him, so i requested the evidence to trust him. He sent me a photo of a screen shot of the payment from other customer. I didn't trust him completely yet, but i transferred money. After a few hours, he said that received payment and would update delivery. He didn't contact me next day, so i asked him about the delivery and invoice receipt. He said that i had to pay the additional money for tax and insurance, then he refunded it when the delivery come. I have never heard about the additional fee, so I told him that i won't pay an more additional fees. He could refund me the money or send phone to me asap. He never sent the phone, invoice receipt and never refunded money. He ended all contact with me after that.

Tinder bitcoin scam I have gotten matched with a few good looking Chinese national on Tinder, their profile pictures are usually of them living a jet-setter lifestyle. At times, their photos will have them posting with luxury cars. What are the odds that such successful ladies are doing on an App like Tinder? They will come off strong, directing the conversation, they will ask about what kind of work you do which is a definite no in Asian culture, it is like asking how much money do you earn. They go on to mentioned they are into investment: Bitcoin. That they work with a certain bank researching into Bitcoin. How Bitcoins are the investment to go to because certain countries are investing in Bitcoin. Do take note of their grammar since I suspect that English isn’t their first language. Red flags should start rising at these moments because Banks do not invest in Bitcoins. No countries are investing in Bitcoins. Whenever in doubt simply do a fact check on Google. I played dumb and played along with them and when I got tired of the conversation, I exposed them. Leading to them blocking me. What I have learnt later is that such scammers will lie blatantly, this is their filter system. To capture the vulnerable who will believe every single word they say. I do not know what happens if one says they are interested to invest in Bitcoins. I have a hunch they will direct you to some scam Bitcoin site for you to make payment.
I was contacted by a person named Trevor Chang on Facebook in April 2020, he asked for my whatsapp number and he declared his feelings quite early on into our chats. He states that he is an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer with American Airlines and is based in Houston Texas. After texting he said that he was sending me a parcel of gifts, but to receive the parcel i had to pay the courier company SGD4000 via cash deposit only (with no invoice or any transcript), which i refused to pay and he said he will settle the problem and send the parcel back to USA. We continued chatting via text and whatsapp calls for the next 6 weeks, when he told me that he was going to Malaysia to take on a freelance contract job for 1 month (from 22nd May to 27th June) to conduct a maintenance, installation and inspection of a jet engine. 2 weeks into the job, he messaged me to ask me for $20,000 to buy some equipment he needs to finish the job on 1st June 2020. i refused and he was trying to use the guilt trip on me to send him money. I have only seen his face via video call for 2 secs on the night before he requested for the sum of money, to be sent to a Singapore savings account so that it can transferred to him. I refused to help him or take his calls after that. His English while was not bad, was not what you would expect from a graduate of a USA university but he did demonstrate some knowledge of the Areospace jargon. He is still active on Facebook and i have some of his pictures if you would like to have them as well. Thank you, hope you can use my experience to help others.
Met a guy on whatsapp/Instagram says he liked me. micheal nguyun +14089878693. says he was a doctor.

I've paid thinking it was ok since it was just a phone. details were quite suspicious though then they threatened me because the package had money. said if i didn't pay 1500sgd I would be charged with money laundering. I planned to report this to the police without drawing attention to myself and my work. blocked both number.
Dated 3rd June 2020. Received from facebook someone wanted to buy old coins from me. Proceed to send coins photo and would pay 32,000usd and sound very promising. They will show their ID, certificate of authenticity. They will tell you to bank in the money using USD to SG. This will be required to pay this "activation fee" to an activist's account for the pending money. Just be careful esp during this current difficult situation COVID-19. Don't trust anyone whom you meet online!
Saw a job ad for a part time personal assistant on google and applied for it. Gave my email and bank acc thinking it was part of HR process, as nothing felt wrong yet. I was to be assisting an ecommerce biz, doing simple ACCOUNTING and checking transactions. On 1st day of work, I realised there was money transferred to my acc. I was told to transfer that amount to another acc and after transferring, money still kept pouring in. I panicked and kept on transferring as I did not want to have anything to do with the cash. Many transactions were (unfortunately) made in a panic and eventually my bank acc and secondary linked acc got frozen. I have a made a police report since, and is waiting to be contacted.

I got a call today (02 June 2020) from a woman with an indian accent from the number +601133559 claiming she is from Singtel technical support and told me that they have detected a suspicious activity on my internet that may result in the loss of connection or slow the internet speed. I told her that I am not having any problem with my internet and that I am currently working and needs to finish something. She was very insistent and asked me to go to my router and reset my router. I said, "Hold on. Did you say you are from Singtel?". She said, "yes, sir. now please go to your router and reset it for me". I said, "how can you detect this issue when I am not even with singtel? i'm with a different service provider, which means, i am not on the singtel network." She explained that all these major Service providers are working collaboratively. So i insisted that i don't have any problems with my internet so i don't think there is anything to fix. I will just change my router password later. Then she threatened me that they will cut off my internet. So I told her to go ahead and do that then I hung up.
Got an automated call from "singapore high court"(+65 92567486) saying there is an outstanding summon. Press 1 for english. I pressed 1 and got connected to a lady who told me to appear in court at 8.30am on june 8th, because my name has been linked with an international money laundering case in china. I was also told that the suspect has been apprehended. I was even given a case number. I was then told that I should speak to singapore interpol and file a report with them asap if i want to clear my name. She said that since this is a government service, all numbers are connected on speeddial, and that she can connect me to interpol herself. I told her I'll call the police myself, and asked her to give me her number. She said "the management has made it easy for them to connect me to interpol instead of me calling interpol, and that i need to file my report asap". I said no thanks, and called 1800-722-6688 to share the scam encounter

She was about to transfer me to another so called "technical engineer" before I hang up. She said she is authorized to resolve this today and asked me to call her back at 8004922429.

Met on slowly app, gave his whatsapp number. Says his name is chen anng and works as an engineer for exxonmobil. Was temporarily assigned in los angeles, california. Slowly app has texas as his location. After the contract, he said he will return to his home country, singapore but kuala lumpur, malaysia will be his next stop first for company clearance.Backstory: originally from singapore and parents passed away when he was still young. Was left under the care of a pastor. Deeply religious. Widower, wife died with the child during childbirth, was left with two children named betty and julie who are under the pastor's care and now at a boarding school in perak, malaysia. Happened on may 15,2020, professes his love early and promises marriage. After two weeks of texting and voice calls daily, have asked for help if can transfer fund for his kids' school needs thru the school principal since he can't do it on his job site due to some restrictions. Asked to transfer $3000, but when declined as i'm on a tight budget, just requested to transfer whatever amount i can. I still declined. The following morning he sent a screenshot of his flight booking to kuala lumpur through the site cheapoair.com but looks like booking confirmation is fake. Last contact was june 1, 2020, called from the airport with background noise and said he will contact me with a malaysia number as soon as he reaches kuala lumpur the next day. Have already blocked and reported this via whatsapp and also sent a report to ftc.gov. This scammer appears to be using stolen photos.

I met this person online, he is from China sichuan working in hongkong (as he claimed). This person will quickly "fall in love with you" and make you do bitcoin investing together so that "we can have more interaction and earn money together". The app is known as huobi but this app doesn't seem to have problem, it's the other app that the person ask you to use that has issue, the name is bambu. The app looks more rundown, graphic is not as good (not sure why i fall for it). He will make you transfer money from huobi into this app.So this person will tell you to start small and guide you together, you will earn money in the beginning. You should just go along, get the money and run out of it. Cause the next step he will ask you to put in more money to earn a bonus from the system. Once you do that, you are dead. Cause the system will tell you that your account got frozen and you need a sum of money to unfreeze it to get whatever money you have inside.How do I know he is lying to me? Cause he wouldn't help me, someone who claimed to "love you" and has been investing for long and together with me, he should have the capital to help, but he refuses to help. He let you die on your own. Long story short, I got into another debt trying to get this money out and this guy will just leave you after.The person may be using another person's photo because he refuses to video call no matter what - so make sure a person dare to do this, before you put in your money.So his picture is different, but i will put down some of the contact numbers you may need to take note of.客服 (customer service hotline for bambu app) - +852 5493 2511叶枫 (that guy's name, might be fake) - +852 5615 1730
I received a phone call from my house number (no caller id, hence unable to provide the scammer's number) on 29 may 2020 around 1.30pm. The conversation goes like this:Indian guy (scammer): hi good afternoon, i am calling from singtel and we were notified that somebody is tapping onto your house's wifi and this results in the slow wifi connection. In order to stop these hackers, may we check how many devices are currently connected to your internet?Me: i dont understand what you're talking about.Scammer: -repeats the above in a sarcasm tone, break down his speech and talks slowly-Me: i have a couple of devices currently connected to my internetScammer: for example, mobile or laptop?Me: yes i have a laptopScammer: ok, now we need you to use your laptop right now so we can direct you to remove these hackers from tapping onto your wifiMe: -thinking that something is not right here-Me: i think it's fine, my laptop is charging and i can't use my laptop while talking to youScammer: -continues his speech while i'm not even listening-Me: -cuts in- actually i dont need to remove them from my wifi, i'll just change the passwordScammer: madam, i'm still talking (that's when i find this call very dubious because a customer care officer shouldn't be rude at all)Me: i need you to prove your identity. Tell me your name and departmentScammer: i'm mike from technician departmentMe: can you tell me the name of the person who signed this singtel contract?Scammer: madam, i need you to use your laptop now so we can rectify the situationMe: can you tell me the name of the person who signed this singtel contract? Or else i am unable to verify your identityScammer: madam, i understand your concern but you have to login to your laptop right now or else i cannot tell you the name.Me: all right, i will call singtel hotline and verify if your identity is real.And the scammer didn't respond to my last sentence at all so i hung up the call. Fortunately, i did not reveal my personal information to the scammer. Yes, it is true that recently i have experienced slower connection with singtel wifi but i feel that the scammers are taking advantage of the current situation to scam others.By the way, i've clarified with singtel and they confirmed that this is a scam call and told me to report to anti-scam helpline. Please help to spread the message across especially to those elderlys who are not well-educated of cyber scams. Thank you.

On 28.5.2020, I received a phone call from +65 94943939. it played a recorded message claiming that I had an unclaimed package at Changi Airport. I was transferred to an operator claiming to be from DHL at Changi Airport. She asked me for a package tracking number. When I informed her that I don't have a tracking number and they were the ones that called me, she immediately hung up on me. I think It's pretty clear that the callers are targeting DHL customers. Since I haven't used DHL for a while and didn't have a tracking number, the callers were not able to take advantage of the situation. I have read of other similar scams on the scam alert website, some more serious where they transfer you to phone numbers in China claiming to be the Chinese police Force. Please stay alert everyone!
I Have received a call today 29 May as well as on 21 May from people claiming to be from standard chartered regarding my credit card. They refused to tell me what the call is about it but wanted to proceed to do a “verification” if i had giro or if i had supplementary card. I declined to answer but they kept pressing me for an answer. Beware of such scams. Banks do not make such unsolicited phone calls asking for such details. I also called standard chartered bank and there was nothing wrong with my account.
I was a victim of an internet love scam. It was a tormenting experience for me and it took me a year to forgive but not to forget. I study the characteristics of such scammers and all have similarities in their operandi modus.Level 1) befriend you with 'hi', 'hello' , earn your trust, get quick intel on your background like marital status, family, whether you are staying alone, occupation to gauge your incomeLevel 2) romancing starts with dear, honey, sweetie, cutie, etc. Often romantic pictures, even sentimental music as props too !!Level 3) money issues often begin with a luxury gift box with hidden money stuck in malaysia, need to pay clearance taxes in us$, emergency medical/surgery expenses, machinery repairs, lost wallet ... The mind game begins.Level 4) hound you desperately, pitiful pleads etc . Angry phone calls to pressure...They work in a team with different roles as the 'lover', logistics, government officer, bank officer like a well scripted drama. They can fake everything - instagram profiles, facebook, logistics websites, crytocurrency website, documentations.My advice - don't believe. Block immediately and get out of social media for a while to calm your mind. If possible, screenshots, record conversations. Go to our friendly police station if harassed. Don't stay quiet and suffer in silence !! It's even better if you can identify the scam before it hurts you!

I received a call at 12 noon from an overseas number, the guy had a very heavy indian accent and said he was from singtel. Because the number was suspicious, i started googling while i was on the phone and did not pay attention to what he was saying but it was something about my internet connection, that there were many people trying to connect to my internet. i asked him, "you are calling from singtel right? why is your number a foreign number?" he said," because i am using an internet phone." but i was still suspicious and i went to my brother's room to ask him. meanwhile the indian guy asked me to check how my modem to see how many lights are on. my brother was convinced it's a scam and asked me to hang up which i did. after that i read up on the scams and found a similar story where the victim was asked to check the number of lights on the modem. i also tried to chat with the singtel chatbot to see if anyone really called me but i was directed to their faq. it is said that singtel staff will not make unsolicited calls to check on your internet connection. so, please hang up if you receive such suspicious calls!
I received a call from an Indian (definitely not local singaporean indian). Trying to tell me he is my internet provider from singtel and claimed that there is an issue in my network. Second call in a month trying to use the same old trick. I had reported the first incident to Singtel already. I exposed him and call him good for nothing scammer don't waste my time. He hung up straight away. Just beware... I wonder how our phone numbers has been dump out or exposed and they even know we are using which service provider. If you encounter any situation like this, just end the call and block the number immediately as long as it is not a local incoming call.

At 2.08pm on 26 May 2020 Tuesday, I received an email to my personal email (Junk folder) with my full name in the subject title. I opened it and read the entire email as it had all my details. I was very shocked and almost believed it as my full name, mobile number, date of birth, and address were stated in the beginning of the email. These details are all accurate/current. Because I share the same last name as this 'barrister' as well as have some relatives in Malaysia, I first thought the email to be true. However, the tsunami disaster in December 26, 2004 seemed like such a long time ago for any inheritance matter to occur. I knew it was a scam when he said that "we would share the percentage on a mutually agreed-upon 60% for me and 40% to your kind self" which seemed like an unfair percentage. I am worried because if this scammer managed to get my personal information, other people/scammers out there may have gotten my information. Thankfully, the NRIC field is left blank which meant that the scammer may not have this piece of information which is the most crucial. No money was lost except my personal information (which I did not give my consent in giving away this piece of information, the scammer had it already). I showed my daughter this scam email, she did some research and found someone who has reported this email as fraud several years ago and she later advised me to share my story on this page. Scammer's email addresses: LCCHNG80@YAHOO.COM.SGCHONGLIMM@LIMCHONGCHUANASSOCIATE.COM
Received a phone call claiming to be from SINGTEL cyber crime unit, telling me some unauthorized used gained access to my computer and they could fix it in few steps. It didn't come across as a scam immediately until he asked me to download anydesk.com to give him access to my computer so that he can help me solve the issue quickly. It was at this point that i realised that it was a scam and started asking for proof that he was indeed a staff from Singtel. He started to faltering and I hung up. Editor's Note: Do not download unknown programmes or give anyone remote access to your computer as this increases your risks of your information getting stolen by scammers. Telecos will not make unsolicited phone calls to inform their customers that their routers got hacked.

And asked for my help as he got no more left in her only account for this project. I immediately refused to help. Tread with caution while trying to make friends online. The moment your online friend asks for financial help or offer to send gifts to you, it's a huge RED FLAG!
I reeived an SMS offering loans, got attracted to it and contact the number for enquiry. The process carry on in WhatsApp chat. I was asked to give snap shot of my WP, prove of Address and bank acc to received the loan. Day 2, I received msg from the same guy and said admin will call me. Short after, another guy call me and said I need to bankin 1900 to activate the loan acc, then only I will receive my loan amount which is 10k with monthly installment 190x5yrs. After I banking $1900,short after, I received msg saying I still need to bankin another 1900 for acc 2 activation. At this point I refused and said I don't have money. He keeps on pushing to make me agree but I denied. I said I want to cxl the loan since I didn't receive any money just cxl the loan. In their pdf agreement stated 15% from loan amount apply need to pay which is 1500. So I told him that since I already bankin 1900 then just take it as cxl fee. He then said its against company policy and said after I pay 1500 then only they will return my 1900. I still refused, the guy even said he will wait until 11pm for my confirmation. After that I never reply his msg. Day 3 morning I make police report about the scam. Police told me not to reply and msg and block those numbers. I still received msg treathening they will ask loan shark to come to my unit to throw paint. Just don't respond to advertisements offering loans as they are either from scammers or worse yet, loansharks!

The scammer (lady with indian accent), pretended to be microsoft singapore called me twice (22/5/2020) and asked me to log into my computer saying that There were some foreign IP addresses which were connected to my home network, and she wanted to help me to resolve . They also sent me an spam email. i didn't lost anything as i knew it was a scam. I am sharing this scam to warn the rest of netizens.
Story is the same as those submitted here. This person contacted me on Instagram and told me he had lost his parents since young and that he's working at hunt oil and gas company. Told me that he loved me and wanted to marry me. Sent me a luxurious parcel via fastwestcourier.com and the company kept asking me for money to get the parcel. They started by saying that the weight of the parcel was heavy, asked for money, then because they found money in the parcel, I need to purchase a declaration certificate of $21.2k sgd and then to pay a fine of $42.6k.
Received a call at 11.07am. An automated voice call saying that they were from singapore high court, asked me to press 9 for further inquiry.After press 9, a lady picks up the call and did not address her name mentioned she was from singapore high court which she immediately asked for my name and ic number. I know THIs is a scam call after looking at the number. Singapore high court doesn't make such calls at all. Instead, they will send a mail letter directly to your house. I told her since when did singapre high court call people and asked for names. IMMEDIATELY the caller ended the call. I tried calling the same number, but the line was engaged. I called the police hotline to inform them about this scam call from Singapore high court. Singapore high court called themselves as supreme high court. Do take note of this scam calls out there. Stay safe.
Here to warn everyone not to google and search for loan company. I faced this situation upon finding a loan therefore checking for interest rates .. I came across http://apcredi?-sg.com this website look so true till i am stupid enuff to provide all my details to them, Couple of calls was make thru wadsapp. They are from malaysia, name jack, zack, jason, Darren. Keep changing names...Mentioning just a record to check for interest rates percent that i am able to get. I trusted them.. They have all my details.. As they are doing the same way wad bank is doing. Next they came to my house slipping in a a4 size paper stating ap credit and a guy name jack. He send my house area and blk pic to me and mention that to settle this. Pay him 300 dollars, i refuse stating i did not loan any money from them y do i have to pay them? Then they got frustrated saying due to my bad attitude they will ask for 1k, Moneylender asked us to pay them 3k to settle this or else our debt will snowball to 30k. It's so outrageous so I went to the police to log a report. They mentioned just ignore. But my family is staying with me.. Wad do u mean by ignore? They sent videos and screen shots of house burning and video on a guy got beaten up cause of owning money. The threatening stopped. For a month. On the 21st May, it started again with me receiving a call from another number again. Upon picking up, he said my apartment was put up for sale on property guru. On the 21st may at about 2 plus my husband mentioned two persons were loitering around our house - a young boi and a lady at the age about 20plus. They attached 2 photos of transactions of $300 money to my bank account. Wait a min. I did not provide my bank account to him. How did they get hold of my bank account? And he mention in the wadsapp that to settle this pay them 700. I went to the police again. I feel upset, frustrated and crossed, y did i land myself into this shit. All I did was to check on the interest RATES. I did not loan any amount from them only check for interest rate. Please ignore scrams! As they are all over the place..do look OUT!
A call from 98749743 was received at 08:24 am 22 may 2020 on my mobile. An automated voice message was telling me i have been summoned by the singapore high court. I pressed "9". Then i waited for a few rings then a guy in english answered me. "singapore high court how can i help". I asked him that this call is regarding what? He told me that he is calling from SINGAPORE high court and there is urgent summon for me and asked me to give the reference number (if any). I said i don't have any and wondering how come i am getting a direct call, they usually don't call like this. i asked their contact details so that i can call them for further clarification and Then he dropped the call. I tried calling back the number (m1) from my mobile and landline, after 3-4 tries i could connect to a lady via my landline number. she told me me that she is in qatar and number is in roaming mode and she is completely unaware of this call. the guy's accent was not very clear and WASN'T very fluent in english. he did not sounded of singaporean or south asian accent.The lady, however, had a south asian accent and pretty fluent in english.
A india lady with thick Indian accent called me at 11am to say that she's from SingTel technical department and they detected abnormal behaviours from my network and asked me if I have laptop besides me to verify. By knowing my laptop is a Macbook and she passed me to another Indian guy. The guy asked me to open my Terminal and key-in "netstat", asked me how many foreign addresses in the results and explained to me which addresses are abnormal and has been established on my network. Because of this, I really believe they are from Singtel at the point of time. After that, they asked me to download and install the app called "Teamviewer" and provide my id and password to them. He even asked me to use the website called “validator” to validate if my email account and bank account has been hackled. I still not aware its scam. The guy told me they will upgrade my security level but it takes 1 more hour. In between he asked me what websites I’m frequently using recently, like ibanking or online shopping. Knowing that they are assessing my desktop and able to see everything of my computer, I felt like something was wrong so I disconnected the remote assess and questioned him if he can prove me he’s the Singtel employee and send my personal email immediately using his Singtel employee email. He gave me a number 8004922429 and his employee number. I searched the odd number immediately, found out the information from Scamalert. The case of scam has been confirmed. I’m not sure how much of my personal information has lost. Don't be the next victim so beware! Editor's Note: Never grant remote to your computer to anyone, especially to unsolicited callers.

On 20 May 2020, a "Jennifer" claiming to be from StarHub called my home line and advised that suspicious activities on my wifi have been observed for the past few days. Some unauthorised devices could have been hacking into my wi-fi. She said they can offer assistance after I have done some verification of devices connected to my wifi. When I requested to verify her identity, she stated that I could verify by comparing the information that she would offer after I have (1) Checked the number of blinking lights on my router; (2) pressed the "Windows" and "R" keys on my connected laptop. Finding her evasive, I refused to follow her instructions, and told her to call me back one hour later as I was about to start a work meeting. Thereafter, I contacted StarHub Customer Service to verify "Jennifer's" claims. StarHub confirmed that it was a scam. StarHub will not request customers to touch our laptop keys. (NOw, I'm waiting to see if "Jennifer" will really be calling me back....)
1. I received a call from +65 65071766 on my Handphone, 2. in the afternoon of 20 may '20, about 1.50pm. The caller claimed to be from singtel and first asked about the quality of (specifically) singtel's internet service over the past few days at home. i mentioned it was fine, and he proceeded to claim that there were alleged hacking attempts done through my telecomm isp. caller spoke in english with unmistakable indian accent, and there was traffic noise in the background, making me suspect that the call seems to be made from india or bangladesh, from an internet cafe. this deeply concerned me as the call number i picked up was with a +65 local extension. caller requested for me to turn on computer and verify with him the computer id. i challenged him suggesting that he gave me my i.p. address and computer i.d. since he was from singtel, and as a service provider he should know. he was also unable to provide any proof that he is a singtel operative. i became annoyed and told him off - if he was the service provider, and there is possible hacking activity through the internet service, shouldn't he be the one solving the problem? with that the caller hung up abruptly. 3) besides a lost of precious time and being victim to nuisance calling, i would like to share this story as it was alarming that the scam call was through a local land-line. this incident has made me more suspicious of local extension calls, as my past encounters with scam calls had international extensions, which i promptly ignored.
I've received a call this morning from singtel internet saying our home internet got UNAUTHORIZED usage.the guy which have indian accent say there is 25 users CONNECTING to my router and request me to use laptop to verify so he can proof it. i checked my singtel domain and there were no 25 users connected to my home router. When I questioned him back and he ended the call.
Received a call from a man, with a heavy indian accent, claiming to be from singtel. The man first asked if you have experienced slow internet connection. then he said that singtel has detected heavy usage on the connection and would like to perform a technical check. he asked me to go to the router to check if the lights are blinking, then asked how many devices are connected. then he asked me to go to a laptop to do a network connection test. he also said that all the actions will be performed by me hence they will have no access to my laptop. when i asked him to verify that he is from singtel, he would ask you to have pen and paper ready to take down the information, then he gave the following information : Name = Stewart john; staff id=stls1059; tel=1800809651; customer ID number (long string of numbers and alphabets); after giving these information, he would assure that this is not a scam and that is why he is able to give so much information. then he said that I can check the information later as i have written it down. after this, he asked me to hold on and my call would be transferred to a higher technician. when I asked to call back to continue, that is when the line was cut-off. the scammers are nasty, they would ask questions as if they are trouble-shooting but in actual fact try to find out more information about your connection and devices available to perform the scam. they would also give you a lot of information to lead you into thinking that they are legitimate and ask you to write it down, as they know that since it was written down, we will be ok to proceed and some may not bother to check further. Please be careful.
I received a call on 19 May 2020 MORNING from an Indian lady with not so fluent English who claimed to be from "Singtel technical service". She claimed that my Singtel broadband was slow and that she needed me to do some things to resolve the issues. She sounded suspicious and when I asked her for her telephone number for me to call her back, she hang up the phone immediately... I do not know whether other Singtel customers had fallen victims to this type of POTENTIAL scams. For anyone reading this, please warn your loved ones of this potential scam! Stay safe and take care!
I received a call today, caller claimed to be a jack william from singtel. Told me me that many hackers from oversea is trying to access my PC. He requested me tp switch on my pc and asked for my laptop id. after several probing questions on what is my id as he mentioned he can see my id, he hanged up. caller is a male with thick indian accent which i have difficult hearing him and getting hm to spell his name. i got a similar call few days ago , that time was a female with also thick indian accent.
I received a msg thru my number regarding loan promotions, i was attracted by it and decided to contact a person named ricky thru whatsapp and enquire abt the loan. I applied for a 20k loan and thereafter gave ricky my income statements a photo of my nric and my next of kin details and my bank acc number. After a few hrs, ricky called me thru whatsapp to inform me that the loan has been approved. He then told me that his company will transfer me a sum of $300 and after a wk i had to return $500, this is to test whether i have the ability to pay back the loan on time a.k.a trial loan. I returned the $500 5 days (on 12 ma), to a posb sav acc stated in the details, however, Ricky told me that i had made a wrong transfer as i did not indicate “ricky clear” as the reference name, he then requested me to transfer another $500 to the same bank acc, and he also told me that the $500 i had paid extra would be credited back to me tgt with the 20k loan after i sign the agreement. I did as he told me and transferred a sum of $500 to him, thereafter, he explained to me that there is an admin fee that i had to pay before i could get the loan, this admin fee is 10% of the loan amt, which is $2000, however, i explained to him that i didnt had enough money and could only fork out $1100, he said he would help me think of ways to help me temporarily pay the remaining $900 of admin fee, after that he msg me and told me that he managed to lend $900 from his wife, and wanted me to pay the $1100 from my acc, while he pay $900 for me, he told me not to tell anyone as helping clients to pay funds is illegal, and also told me to return him immediately after i get the loan. The next day, he told me that his manager found out about the funds and questioned him, and also confiscated the funds until i could fork out the remaining $900. I took around 5 days to raise the $900 and transferred him, he also promised me that there would not be anymore issues. However, the next day, he messaged me again to say that the funds could not be drawn out as it is under a red column. Knowin that something was wrong, I called the police after that.Editor's Note: Please note that licensed moneylenders are not allowed to advertise their services online, via messaging apps or SMS.

Met this guy who claimed to be from Singapore but brought up at LA, Chris Zhang.. we been start chatting in Instagram and then change to chat on WhatsApp... we chatting like best friend, 10 may then Chris tell me he already buy some gift and try to send to me from LA send to Singapore.. what I need to do is just pay the local fee for the package with 20kg valuable item.. I was shocked when heard that the package was 20kg! I started suspecting it was scam and he tried to ask for my home address, which was an old address. I received a message from WhatsApp hp no = 91365926 and asking me make a payment S$3500 for received the package, and I try to contact Chris why I needed pay so high cost the payment, he ask me don't worry he already put $4000 inside the package, after I made the payment, I could get the money in the package I told him that I refused to accept the package. He became angry and to threaten me to get me into trouble with the law since he has my address. I am so lucky from starting I already suspect him and never giving my detail except my hp no
I received a phone call by a man who addressed himself as agent xyz. He informed me that he was calling from inland revenue Authority of singapore and he requested to have my credit card number to receive tax refund as IRAS had overtaxed me of $4xx.00 last year. I questioned him where was he calling from as he addressed me not by my real name but by my nickname in my Facebook account. He then repeated himself agent so and so from iras. Through the phone I could hear the environment that seemed to be outdoors with road noise. It was really suspicious for iras to refund me and for him to call me not from an office! I told the caller I do not need any tax refund. He was taken aback and ended the call shortly.
On 25 april, 10.22 am i received a message saying, ' your delivery has been stopped at our depot'. Trk#: r690382803147. Please resolve the issue here: 1pi.us/vivtu (:Note this is a phishing site)When i opened the link, it showed a fake website with Singpost logo. I had ordered online some products so i though the person didn't pay enough stamp fee so i decided to top-up the $ 2.98. After 2 days, $ 106 was deducted from my posb credit card.This is a phishing message.Again i receive another message to to pay a few dollars after few days.
It all started from an IG message (antony_lee23) and he claimed to be working in Edinburgh oil industry and he has Singaporean-Korean origins. We chatted on whatsapp and he always texted me in the morning and night every day without fail. Days later, he started to tell me that he has feelings for me and will send me loving messages. He then insisted to send me some gifts in appreciation for me and I rejected him initially but he pushed on until I gave him my address. 4 days later, a man from the ‘courier company’ (+65 8682 5805) texted me via whatsapp that my package has arrived in Singapore and I need to pay SGD3,600 to clear custom charges before they can deliver the package and I need to pay it asap within a few hours before delivery insurance expires. I checked with Antony and he played mind games about being upset if I were to reject his gift. When the courier company provided an account number with personal name instead of company name (POSB Bank Acct Name: Shah Nizam; Acct No: ??83 6385), and refused to provide any picture of customs’ statements requesting for the duty fees, it got really fishy. The man on the phone sounded French but with a Malay name? Thankfully I found this website and read about many similar scams. So I immediately blocked the two contacts and avoided paying for anything. Hope this story helps to prevent others from being scammed too.
A guy called me to say that he is from starhub and they have detected abnormal behaviour from a third party hack in my internet which was cause security problem and also the connection slow down. My internet was indeed slow &amp; sometime not able to connect .then he asked me to check my router by using my computer to run an application, while he was asking me to type in a command to execute a program &amp; give him security code. I told him why i must give secuirty code and what is no evidence to prove he was from Starhub. I told him i will call 1633 to double confirm but he stop me and claimed that the security issue only settle by their dept. After that he gave me very odd number 8004922429 to call &amp; hang up. When i called the number he gave , the person who pick up the call also the same guy. So i called Starhub to check my internet and the by technical support officer, there wasn't any security issues and that's when I found out that it was a scam. If i continued to run the program, he would have hacked into my computer and stole my personal information.

I was looking for a personal loan online. I was unfortunately landed on a scammer google ad which misrepresent a licensed moneylender. This scammer texted me requesting for my nric, 15 mths cpf statements, latest payslips and nok particulars. I was scammed a total of $32k as their "processing fee". The whole incident was very traumatising. Scammers will misrepresent those licensed moneylender and usually will use numbers which cannot call through.

2 scam phone calls were received on our company landline. First a lady called, then a man rang on a different day. Both callers had thick Indian accent, poor English and claimed to be from SingTel. Upon finding out that we are with Starhub, the lady tried to explain that Starhub uses SingTel's network and hence she is contacting us instead of Starhub. The 2nd call ended quickly as the guy hung up immediately when I asked for his number to call him back.

I have received a call from this number: +92-345-9593780 saying that he is from DBS and that my account has been blocked because my details are not updated. I hung up when he asked for my posb user id and password.
This happened during the m1 broadband outage on 12 may 2020. A lady posing as singtel staff called my family member claiming to be checking on the pretext that the infrastructure is managed by Singtel (broadband account is under my name), and that our broadband may have been compromised by hackers. they asked my family member to install teamviewer and log in using their account.The phone was passed to me and they started to ask about whether i did internet banking. They then informed another technical staff will call me for further checks. Another guy with an indian accent then called back my family member's hp using an unknown number. After getting me to me to run msconfig he took remote control of the laptop. I did not grant them remote access so i started getting concerned.the laptop screen blanked out several times so i am not sure what they might have done. I requested to verify their number and identity. That was when he ended the call.Editor's Note: Please do not entertain calls about internet connection issues. Callers will often claim to be from "Singtel". Do not grant remote access to your computer to anyone as well.

I do not usually pick up calls from unknown numbers but since i have been ordering things online, i figured there might be times where the deliveryman may need to call me. I received a call today 11 may 2020 at 11.27am. The number +6567892006 looks quite legit so i answered. I had to say "hello" three times and then came a man on the line who spoke in a thick indian accent. He claimed that he is from "Singtel" and said there was something wrong with my internet connection / broadband. I was like "huh? can you repeat?" It took a few seconds for him to answer (the line seems laggy) and he answered like he was reading from a screen. Sensing that this might be a scam, I replied, "if there is something wrong with my internet, i would call singtel myself. Ok bye!" I hung up the phone immediately.
The call was made by a local number hence i picked it up. it was an indian lady with a thick accent. she claimed that she was from singtel and that there were unauthorised devices that connected to my home wifi. i was a little panicky but then i remembered that the household teleco was starhub. I told her i was under starhub and she insisted on transferring the call over to starhub. i then hung up.
A indian man IMPERSONATING SING-TEL called me on 11 may 2020 9.10am to inform that my SING-TEL wifi is compromised and there are UNAUTHORIZED access, so he requires some information from me.

I insisted on having the time and date of the UNAUTHORIZED access and he requested me to switch on my computer to do so. I refused and repeatedly asked for more information regarding the UNAUTHORIZED access which FRUSTRATED him and he hung up.

This charming-looking guy (stan) from a dating apps (coffee meet bagel) contacted me - claiming he's a real estate investor &amp; stuck in kuala lumpur right now during lockdown &amp; can't wait to go back home. First i thought he was genuine (having sg no +6597461422 &amp; mal no +60168764238). Started to trust him &amp; i felt i had a nice connection, looking fwd for him to come back to sg. But i started to notice he replied in wee hours like 1 or 2 am. In the end my 'suspicion' came true - he asked for help, he cannot pay his transfer tax (for work) as his account got problem &amp; he needs to verify in person in sg while he is right now in kl - asked me to send $4400 to asimah binet kemat (maybank 14190602253) - i realize he's just a scammer. I called him too - he sounded like an african guy. I did image research - he used pictures of a south korean plastic surgeon. I told him I would send but of coz never :). Please be careful if someone contacted you &amp; ask for a video call.
Scammer found my contact via Indeed Jobsite and emailed me about a part-time job on 5/5/20. I enquired via Telegram http://t.me/Anakmobilegadgets and was told to post items for sale on Facebook Marketplace and Carousell. They claimed to be a mobile shop in Changi Airport Duty-Free Zone. Job is simple, just post 5 items per day and direct enquiries to his/her Telegram. Payment will be daily around $200 per day. Posted items on 7/5/20 evening and realized access was blocked on Marketplace on 9/5/20. Didn’t received payment and suspect the whole thing was a scam. Googled and found similar cases. Tried to warn interested buyers but my account was blocked and can’t reach out to them. I have attached 2 screenshots of the email and telegram. Scammer Telegram ID is Anakmobilegadgets and Mobile is 87325904. However ID and mobile can be changed, please be wary of such job posts and DO NOT post items for sale on behalf of anybody be it FaceBook Marketplace, Carousell, or etc. I will be making a police report on this matter.
Received a watsapp message / call from this guy call paul oh. He was very persistent in pushing the loan to me and having the need for money, I agreed and the scam starts.He said that in order to get the loan, applicants need to agree with a bank test loan i.e. They will send a sum of money and in agreement, you need to send back the amount agreed e.g. They send 200 and we need to return $380 i.e. $180 for them. Additionally, they promised to return the 100 immediately after we send them.When I asked him to remit the 100, he got pissed and immediately block me and the so called finance dept of his blocked me too.In total, i lost 180 from this scammer. The finance department no is 90767141.Hope this incident does not happen to any of netizens here and hope to have this scum bags arrested.Editor's Note: Licensed moneylenders are NOT allowed to advertise their services online (including social media), via social messaging apps and SMS.

I received a call at 11:30am (mobile +6569857344), a person with thick Indian accent told me that he was calling from Singtel and it was in regard to to my home internet connection. Then he asked me how many lines was connected to my modem. I sensed wrong when there is no internet line under my name. I told him that if he want to know my details he could check from your company system, but he say he is not able to check because he is working from home. Then I said he could ask his colleague to check, then he say he is not able to do so. I told him that I will report him to the police, he say I can report to the police but he need to know my details, then I just hang up the call immediately. I had reported this case to singtel and also made a police report. Editor's Note: Don't engage with scammers and if you know a call is a scam, simply hang up and block the number. There is no need to reason with scammers. Note that telecos will not call their customers to inform them of issues relating to their internet connection.

I received a call on my mobile from an unknown number today. He said he was "Steve" from Singtel and spoke with authoritative voice. He said there were some unauthorised devices which had connected to my home wifi and had to guide me on how to check who they belonged to. He asked me to run command prompt and read to him the last line which contains my computer login userid. I asked him for first and last name before telling him and he said goodbye. I know it is a scam because my home wifi is not singtel. Editor's note: Note that telecos will not call you to inform you that there are internet connection issues. Users are the ones who supposed to call the telecos to inform them of the issue with their internet connection.

He shared one day that his ship will be landing in Poland and asked for my details (name, address, clothes size, shoes size) and mentioned that he is gonna get me something from Poland and shipped to me. I rejected in the first place, but he insisted so i gave him the details. later that day he send me the detail of the website with tracking number, www.airtrustservices.com (bet the website is also fake). after 4 days the tracking details showed the package reached singapore. one day before the package showed arrive, david lee said that he stuffed some cash in the package for me to pay for the charges. the next day, someone claimed he is mr.karl from air trust service courier (+65 86970175) and told me the package has reached singapore and ready to be delivered to my address. after we arrange the delivery time, he proceed to tell me that i have to pay for local charges and import duty tax sgd3500. then i asked for invoice, he say after payment made invoice will be send together with the package, and provided the bank details GANESH SHARMA KRIS???

I started doubting why the account details is not from the shipping company, he said the account details belong to the secretary in charge today. so i ignored him, he start to pester me with the payment or else government will confiscate the package until i threaten to report to the police.
Just sharing my personal experience on the people who i talked to on social networking sites. By going through the stories posted by the victims in this site, i noticed there are some similiar signs of warning which i experienced. 1. attractive photos - This is the first magnet that lured me into engaging a conversation with them. i even did a reverse image search on the photos but it return zero results. 2. self-Proclaimed millionaire - Claimed that he owns a factory in osaka, showing pictures that he is driving a porsche. In my two encounters, they are very wealthy in their early 30s. 3. where are they - interestingly enough, they are never near to me. they are either in guangzhou or in osaka. 4. language preference - not being racist here, most of them are chinese. they are more comfortable to converse in chinese. but in my recent encounter, he is quite fluent in english. 5. touching stories - about how poor he was in the past and able to make a name for himself as the boss of a company. for the other guy, he is a divorce, claimed that his wife cheated on him. 6. investment methods - seems like they very into crypto currencies. they claimed that they have uncles abroad who knows the market very well and posted screenshots of their earnings. in my first encounter, he was very pushy to get me to buy some bitcoins and play some game in a chinese website. hope this helps.

Dear friends, You can make friends in the social media, not all are bad people. I have good friends via FB in overseas. Bear this in mind, no matter how good a relationship with a friend either man or woman, once they talk about facing in some problems start to beware, it is going to be money problem. Once they talk about how much they earn from Crypto, Forex, is going to be a lured into investment. First I will do a picture image search on google. If his or her face appear in many other social media with different names, it is likely a scammer using other people's profile. #Beware these peoples:- 1) If you are ask to go into hangout to chat 2) If they video call you but you couldn't see them clearly and cut off within seconds 3) They can't call you at all due to certain security they are facing 4) They will ask their children to chat with you to gain your trust 5) They can't use video call at all due to the types of phone they are using 6) He or she will tell you, love you to the moon and back 7) Show you the investment account with lots of money 8) Ask you to donate for charity and help the present covid situation 9) And all of them are very rich with status like Doctor, Engineer, Self Employed 10) Write beautiful messages that makes you happy everyday 11) Send pictures of their house, rooms, parents, children etc 12) Send you compromising photos of themselves 13) Normally they text you as Dear, Darling, Honey, Babe, Dearie, Sweetheart etc to please you #Beware when they ask you for this:- 1) Buy a Birthday cake for them - it can cost up to a few thousands SGD 2) Buy a handphone for them as they are at high seas and hand phone dropped into the sea 3) Help them as they are stranded in another country and need some cash and will pay you back double 4) Children are very sick and need to see a doctor and they are stranded in the military base 5) Help as a applicant to apply for leave vacation and you pay for their air ticket 6) Ask for your account as they wanted to transfer the charity donation to put into your account 7) Some will ask you to go to a Singapore Company as they had few hundred thousands there and ask you to help take for them but first of all you need to pay a transaction fees. I had met all of the above. I chat with them and observe the types of scam and method used so that I wish to warn all my fellow friends. And I waited for them to to give me their recipient bank account. I will not do any transfer. I do wish I have a way to report them but it seemed not able to catch them as they are overseas. At last what I do is to block them. Bear in mind that once the money is transferred, chances of you getting it back is near zero.
I received a call from a guy with a thick indian accent. he said my wife full name and WANT to SPEAK to her. He said he is from microsoft support claiming my wife computer had security issues, he need to install driver for her. Knowing that things doesn't add up. I hung up the phone.
Scammer introduced himself as a a staff from "SINGTEL. He told me that i need to be patient to take this call and asked me to restart the router. I TOLD THEM THAT AM NOT A sINGTEL CUSTOMER.... IMMEDIATELY GOT DISCONNECTED.
there are a few attempts made via viber, unsure how they got my contact. Previous names: hello dbs, d b s bank and now dbs digibank, shows that they are using various names with dbs in them. these are obvious scammers as they are all contacting via viber, which is a very unconventional mode of communication via viber.Editor's Note: If you have received such calls, hang up. No legitimate organisation will use social messaging apps to contact their customers.
Kelvin liqiang approached me via instagram in early of april 2020.he told me he was born in beijing and grew up in uk with his uncle after he lost his parent when he was 4 years old. He also shared that he is currently working in raytell electrical co. Limited, uk as an electrical engineering. His words were coated with honey and texted me day and night and wanted to fly over to singapore after the covid-19 situation after knowing our common interests and others.This was how the story began, he shared that raytell was giving out a contract to the outstanding staff to reward the hardwork of the staff. He won the reward and the contents of contract were to built a new hospital in bulgaria. He snapped a picture to proof the contract. Before going to bulgaria, he went to the bank to pledge his collateral to get a loan to buy equipment's and tools for the project. ..due to the closure of airport in bulgaria, he flew over to bulgaria by private jet of the bulgarian government.. Then, he informed me that he couldn't clear the equipment's and tools due to the speciality tax and custom fees in bulgaria. He even told that his lawyer had forked out some money to help him. I told him to borrow from his colleagues who were on the same trip. I even proposed him to call his bank to allow him to extend the loan to him and necessary verification steps to be done by the bank. Every suggestions i gave seemed no possible for him and needed me transfer money to help him. He gave me the united oversea bank account number : 9281330434 and the name of the bank account holder was soh ai lin which he claimed that she was an agent from bulgarian custom.After the transferred on 24 april 2020, i asked for the evidence on the custom fees as he asked for another usd3,000 to move his tools and equipment from custom to the site via a private truck.he was able to provide the document issued by the bulgarian government. So, i planned to help him with the transportation fees.After much discussion with the bank officer, he warned me it was a love scam and he also explained to me how to verify the documents.

I was scammed for $5000 on 2 separate payments. I was informed that I would be receiving a gift from Poland by a friend I met online, Mr Ahmed Ibrahim, claiming he grew up in London. His address is Zwirki Wigury, 00-00, Warsaw Poland According to him, the payment need to be settled by recipient and he, the sender, informed me that he had included the delivery payment in USD dollars to cover the cost of shipping. He said I can use the money to settle the delivery charges and buy some clothes for myself. In the box he sent, he claimed there would be a surprise for me, showing pictures via whatsapp of 2 ladies bag, a necklace and rolex watch set. I did not ask him to do all this, he went and did it on his own. I have a sense that the two parties involved, among others, were the same person. One was a so-called friend, Ahmed Ibrahim, charming me to like him. The other claimed to be the international courier representative, contact number +6018-4039782. I noticed both made similar spelling mistakes and they will take turns being busy and uncontactable. Mr Ahmed was also observed to be too calm about this matter. The first payment of $1500 was made yesterday 29 April 2020 via DBS online banking to Maybank account number ???218662931 Hasima binti mohd said. I was suspicious when they refused cash payment even when I asked to. I believe it is an international syndicate that involves several people in other countries. I had also noticed that the sender's social media account on Facebook suddenly disappeared later in the evening. When asked, the sender replied he deactivated the account. The second payment of $3500 was made today 30 April 2020 via DBS online banking to bank DBS Singapore Lim Tjie Wie account number ???-017869-0. I almost borrowed money from a licensed moneylender to settle this amount. I am grateful as the staff informed me that this was a scam and to report to the police. After blocking all contacts, i saw a man lurking outside our home corridor. Pretended to walk pass our door slowly, paused in front of our door then continued walking then changed his mind when he saw the camera, turned around and walk pass our house again.
It happened when my friend's instagram account got hacked. The scammer messaged me and said that it was a contest by giving a 6 digit pin sent to my sms so i did and followed and realised that it was a purchase made to a game Pubg S$19.25 I did it 11 times so in total I lost S$211.75
I responded to a loan Sms &amp; visited the website http://www.1133moneylender.com/ From the website I click on the whatsapp number and was directed to contact with their loan agent Gavin &amp; according to their website their office is located in raffles City builDing. They cLaimed to be related to the actual Moneylender company 1133moNey lender at BAlestier. He ask me for my details, the standard loan procedures: NRIC, payslip, 6mths CPF statement &amp; send across a video of me holding my NRIC. I have requested for loan of S$50,000 and monthly payment $950 x 60mths. he told me that he will be transferring $500 into my account, as their company practice, which I will need to transfer $800 back to them once my application is approved and the extra $300 will be deducted from my first installment. The next day he told me that the loan has been approved and I can transfer the $800 back to him, After I transfer $800 to the account his gave me (POSB ???-09813-3), he told me that I make an error in my transfer comment which I didn't indicate as “GAVIN CLEAR”. As such their system unable to match my transfer, thus need to redo the $800 transfer to another account (UOB ???-384-0571) indicating “Gavin clear” After the transferred he called me saying that my name is flagged as red name in their system due to my first error transfer, there he ask me for another transfer of $2750 for the red name removal. Both the $800 and $2750 will be reimbursed to me together with my loan when we meet up to sign the loan contract. After I transfer another $2750 to (UOB ???-384-0571), he called me again saying that there should be another $2750 transfer for them to reactivate my loan account. This is when I'm beginning to sense that i might have be scammed. I have requested to speak to his accountant, which another guy by the name of Jeffery called me and give me the same story. After this i called my bank to seek for help in cancelling the transfer, however bank told me that a police report need to be make &amp; shared with the bank.

Scammer told me to promote his product and suddenly, my account got blocked on carousell. I thought the money was too good to be true but true enough, I got scammed. I thought I could earn some income during the cb period but guess not. found the job on Facebook and I will never do this kind of job ever again. before account was blocked, a seller was interested in buying. I guess my account got blocked due to that as he might have been cheated by the scammer.Editor's Note: Please do not trade on behalf of others as you might end up dealing with disgruntled customers when the person who "hired" you turned out to be a scammer. Also, it's against Carousell guidelines to trade on behalf of others. https://support.carousell.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011881808-Terms-of-Service

Came to know this person named Davis Liu on Cmb and lost a total of S$27000 over a period of 7 months. He claImed to be a petrol chemical engineer currently posted to Kuwait for a contract. asked for money for his equipments and work tools. Subsequently asked for more money to open a bank account as he inHerited his dead mother’s money and need an account with the fake bank he created to gain access to the funds. He promised that he would pay back everything one he got the funds but disappeared after money was transferred. There was even a fake bank manager communicated with me via email and scammed me.
basically while i was scrolling carousell, i saw this ads impersonating as a license moneylender. as i need some funding for my business during this trying times, i went to enquire. i thought personal particulars is normal to enquire for a loan, shorty after i received $300 for this guy. right after i demand him for his account number to transfer back the money as i didn't agree to take up the loan, he basically just say don't worry that money is to open a account. went to make a police report the next day, and it was confirmed that this was a UML. Today i received a text demanding me to pay up $450 by a certain time but with the advise by the IO and friends, i did not transfer. i hope there will be no harassment or so. but i am ready for the worst. please please do not trust this kind of people. and to debtors its not worth it to do this, just go and make a police report and save yourself.
Knew this person named davis liu from cmb and he claimed that he is a Chinese-American working in kuwait for a contract job. Sweet talker and a very convincing person. Asked for usd$3000 to pay for his work tools as he had no access to his us bank account while in kuwait. Subsequently asked me to loan s$10000 to help him with a crisis at work related for failure in machinery. Said he will be stuck in kuwait if he doesn't finish his contract promised he would pay once he is done. Months later, he asked for usd$5000 to open a bank account as he inherited his mum’s money as she passed away due to car accident. Said the money can be transferred from his mums account to his when he opens this new account. Said he’ll pay me everyt once he has access to thhose funds. Then so-called bank manager named daniel edwards from rbc (a fake email given and fake account manager) said he required cash on transaction usd$3000 to transfer davis mum’s fund into davis account. He said that if i don’t pay this amount then I couldn’t get back all my money asap as this is the only problem left. After paying, he disappeared. I notified the banks and police immediately

I received a text message from authmsg on 28 april 2020, at 645pm, which reads "your delivery has been stopped at our depot. Trk#: r690382803147 please resolve the issue here: 6ak.us/vbhf?". I sent a tracked package out earlier in the afternoon via singpost so i clicked on the link. It directed me to a page that looked like Singpost's website, and asked me to make payment of about $1.67. I filled in my personal information on the first page (name, contact number, email and address) and when i clicked to the second page for payment, the page looked suspicious as it wasn't the usual payment page i saw while shopping online. It looked like a page from a foreign bank, which i wouldn't expect singpost to use. I immediately stopped and went back to the first page of the link, and clicked on the singpost logo at the top of the screen to reload. It didn't bring me back to the singpost homepage, but instead tried to load a different page. I went to the official Singpost website and found out that there were phishing scams recently regarding this, so I called the customer service hotline and verified that it was a scam.
I met this guy named Davie on coffee meets bagel. He told me he was the owner of an export and import company based in singapore. He told me he loved me and he wanted to teach me how to invest. I downloaded the investment APP called FDI Investment from a link he sent me. I invested S$1000 and S$2000 respectively and managed to get my cash back. On the third try, the service provider of the app told me that i have to meet cash limit of $50,000 before i can withdraw my cash. After meeting the cash limit, the service provider said i need to top up to $100,000. I ran out of cash and davie said i need to borrow from banks, if not both of us will lose all our funds as our accounts are linked. He preyed on VICTIM's goodwill and compassion too. In total, i LOSt 140000sgd. Please be careful as i know davie has fake profiles on all social dating app.
I've received a phone call from a guy claiming to be a Singtel Technician today. He claimed that their system received multiple illegal devices connected to my internet. he asked me for the number of users whom I'm sharing my wifi with (I did not disclose this and said I can't remember). He then asked me to check and remove the permission of unauthorised devices that are connected to my network. Before he provide me with step-by-step instructions that involve going to a particular website, I told him that my laptop is not with me right now and I will contact singtel again when I have it back. He told me that he can only resolve this issue if i provide him live update while visiting the website he advised. Since I am unable to surf net now, he will call me back later (sort of discouraged me from contacting singtel from my end) no information was lost through this conversation.

I talked to this girl on LIne which I found her from Tinder. initially it was going smoothly, then she offered the services because she was a student doing part time job, needed some money, etc. So I went with it. upon meeting at the location, she said her “friend" will contact me to arrange the meetup. Then he told me to pay S$300 at the AXS machine via alipay top-up. AFter that he asked for more, giving other excuses. I felt fishy after paying 3k. I wanted to stop but he sort of threaten me. Once I've left the vicinity, the girl contacted me and then showed gruesome video of they threatening. In the end I was too gullible and pay another 5k worth of google playstore card. Unfortunately, I can't write much as I'm limit to 500 words. I can go all day long and list every details of how they scam and what kind of excuses given. I found out that the girls are around HK and they somehow manage to spoof their location in Singapore. Don't trust any girls providing LINE ID in dating apps. (eg, tinder, CMB, etc).Editor's Note: Police have shared that at least S$295,000 was lost to credit-for-sex scams in March this year, with about 112 reports lodged. We advised MOPs to be wary of such scams during this Covid-19 period as scammers are not taking a break during this period. Also, a gentle reminder that members of the public are to stay home and avoid going out during the “circuit breaker” period.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sex-scams-police-online-wechat-tinder-michat-locanto-skokka-12651698

in the morning of 23-April while on my way to work riding our shuttle, was interrupted in what i am reading in my phone by a call from this number +65 8859 9991. and when i answered it a voice recording was heard asking me to press "9" for details of the call. i immediately hanged up instinctively knowing that did not violated any law. when i reached my office desk, made me curious to check its veracity, straight away searched for singapore high court website to verify thecall register i received and its not the official number of the agency it is claiming to be. nothing was lost but i know some unscrupolous people or group like them are preying on individuals that are caught off-guard and eventually stealing money or information.
I met Clifford Weng on Meeff. He claimed to be half thai (dad) and Singaporean Chinese (mom) but born and raised in USA Florida. Works in Oil and gas industry. We chatted on Whatsapp and he always texted me in the morning and night every day without fail. He told me a lot of personal details about himself and his GF cheated on him last year and was heartbroken. 1 week later, he started to tell me that he has feelings for me and will send me flirty messages. He frequently send me selfie of himself. 2 weeks later, he told me that there is an important contract that he is bidding for and will be doing some shopping to prepare for his contract. The next day, he told me that he went shopping and he thought of me and bought some gifts for me and asked me for my shipping address so that he can send the gifts to me. I rejected him initially but he insisted that he wanted to do this due to his appreciation for me giving him back his faith in trust and friendship during his lowest time when he was emotionally drained due to his past relationship and he really appreciated my support as a good friend. He sounded so sincere so I gave him my contact details and address. He gave me the courier tracking link and the tracking number the next day. 1 week later the ‘Malaysia custom’ (+601133157142) texted me via Whatsapp that my package has arrived in Malaysia and I need to pay S$3000 to clear custom and overweight charges before they can deliver the package and I need to pay it asap before delivery insurance expires. I asked the Customs to send it back to the sender but they said that it is not possible. I asked Clifford what was included inside the package that weighed over 17kg and he told me that he send me expensive perfume, massager, female accessories, watches and cash of USD$10K for my inconvenience as I need to pay the excess charges and he urged me to pay them asap so as not to waste his effort of sending me the gifts. I requested the custom to show me proof of the package and the declaration of the items inside, they claimed that they are unable to do so. I told Clifford that I do not have the money to pay for it and he suddenly accused me of being ungrateful and how I do not appreciate all his effort in trying to make me smile. I also googled for the courier company and it seems fishy and fake hence I suspected that there is no such package in the first place. Thankfully I found this website after googling which showed many similar scams that happened before. I have reported and blocked them since. Hopefully this story helps to prevent others from getting scammed too.
I received a robocall in English, followed by a similar message in Mandarin from this number (+65 88389585). thereafter, i pressed "9" and the call was redirected and picked up by a person (HE SOUNDED LIKE A LOCAL) who said that he was from the high courts and that i had been summoned by the courts and needed to attend a court hearing on the coming monday at 9 am. WHEN INQUIRED on the nature of the summons, he requested for my name to check. thereafter, he requested for my nric number and that was when i hesitated and declined to furnish it to him. he claimed that two summons had been sent and since there was no reply, i was now required to attend court. when i questioned him on how was that possible since i was definitely home during the last 2 weeks given the covid19 shutdown, he sounded curt and was not unable to provide a coherent response. when i requested to speak to his supervisor, he became unhelpful and our call ended. HOPE THIS SHARING HELPS IN AVOIDING OTHERS FROM GETTING SCAMMED.
Matched with an overzealous tinder profile by the name of 建雄, 33 years old. He asked for my mobile number and took the conversation to WhatsApp almost immediately. introduced himself as “杨建雄”. Right after, he unmatched me on Tinder. Initially claimed he’s from Hong Kong, but eventually admitted that he’s from China, ‘working and shuffling between Hong Kong and Singapore’. This was after I probed about why he was using simplified chinese when Hong Kong-ers typically use traditional Chinese. Strangest part of it all? The mobile number he’s using is tagged to a Philippines country code. Within 2 days, he started dropping sweet nothings at an astronomical speed. What I noticed was that his stories started to fall through the cracks and didn’t gel with what he had earlier claimed. Such as how his Hong Kong company had suddenly been ‘reclaimed’ within a grand total of 5 days. Scanned the internet trying to find his social media profile. Instagram was non-existent and Facebook profile looked extremely dodgy. Subsequently, he tried to get me to download some investment app and offered to ‘guide me through’ investment related matters - which I didn’t. Read up online and he was showing pretty much ALL signs of an online dating scammer; probably looking to dupe an innocent victim for an investment related scam. Apparently, this form of scam is getting more commonplace on social networking sites like Tinder. I’ve since blocked him. I’m lucky to have been skeptical from the onset and evaded getting scammed. Though I thought I’d share this case before others fall prey to his ‘charms’.
I got a call from the number +6588476335 saying that I have a summon against my name. through a robocall. Then on pressing 9 it forwarded me to some person. The person took my name and ic number and said i have a court case and need to be present on 27th April in court. When asked for details he said its related to some money laundering case. someone in china was arrested and he name me as involved. then he was asking if i had done some transaction. i told him i will go to the nearest police station and check the details. then he just disconnected the call. this was surely a scam call.
I got an automated call coming from the sg court (spoofed number). I was given a case number and told that this was regarding a court case involving money laundering for which i had to show up. I was transferred to another person telling me that i should file a police report which would arm me for the court case. The scammer warned me of phone scams, let me check the Singapore Interpol number on the internet, hung up and called me from that very number (spoofed). I was asked to install the line app, provide identity details and was later asked about financial details (no account numbers or credit card numbers).Editor's Note: Please note that the Interpol in Singapore or Singapore High Court will not be making unsolicited phone calls to members of the public. Note that scammers can use spoofing technology to create fake numbers to reflect on your Caller ID. Hence, please beware of impersonation phone scams!
a name chad appeared with the number I have listed 2359822148 with name chad. I thought he was my colleague from usa with the same name. I picked up only to recognise the voice as Indian accent claiming he is from Singtel The first question he asked was "Is your internet working?" I answered "Yes" and that's when I realised it's a scam. I hung up immediately.
Happened just today (21/4) when a "singtel" technician called me. i entertained them for 20 minutes cause they'd waste my time instead of another vulnerable person's time out there - and they eventually gave up. :)

Simply hang up this call as Singapore High Court will not call you out of the blue!

A text message was sent from 35479 via sms: "your parcel 006232013 will not ship from the distribution centre. Track your package http://59t.us/veroy." upon clicking, it would bring you to a website that looked like singapore post's but its website address was totally different - https://signup.yogasuma.care, and there's a message that claimed there was a shortage of s$2.95 in postage, and you would need to make this payment for your parcel to be delivered.Editor's note: Please do not click on the link.

My helper almost got scammed just now. She asked me if i can help her pay on her behalf by transferring money over for her to buy facial products for her problem skin. After checking the source, I was very sceptical cos no reviews and the seller only joined in feb. But seeing that it was only $27, I transferred the money over. And gave my address and bank account details. Then the game starts. Seller tried telling my helper sent wrong account no., said that account is supposed to be to the boyfriend and we have transferred wrongly. then said is correct will send item, then confirm that she cannot send cos money was sent to her boyfriend who is a cheat. Wasted 45min of my time.Hope she learns her lesson not to be too trusting.🤦🏼‍♀️ And in the message, many other addresses which seller claimed she has mailed the good before has been compromised as she started to show she is legit after we threatened to report to police.
Received call on my mobile at 15:54 from +0355387160, robocall message instruction was to press “3” in Mandarin. But call got cut off. Editor's Note: If you are not expecting calls from overseas and the call is not in your contacts, and it's a robocall, hang up immediately.

I mentioned 8000, however was told to take 10,000 instead. Monthly repayment of 577.10 for 18 months(translate to 4%per annum - too good to be true). After which he asked for my personal particular i.e bank account, cpf contribution, nric and my name card. He started sending me contract in pdf that looks real and i was convinced when he start mentioning there’s a admin fee of 1000 where i need to transfer to ocbc account first.

He convinced me if i dont pay, daily recurring holding charges will be charged. Being afraid, i managed to partial transfer 300 via internet banking to another account posb for holding charge.On 17 apr 2020, another guy called sky 86535470 txt me claiming to cover vk chua and was convinced to pay remaining 700 holding charges.On 18 apr 2020, boss Ron say i need to pay lawyer fee of 1000 with a forged pdf that they send me to sign.

I met this guy on CMB. The guy claimed he is Singaporean Chinese who grew up in us and is working in an oil rig in kiev. parents died, currently Lives at Tanjong Pagar. Can't talk on the phone or video call. Lots of sweet talk i actually fell for it but it didn't seem right as just too perfect. A few days ago, he claimed equipment needs repair and ask to send money usd15k. My heart was broken but did not send money.
I received a call saying i have an urgent matter with MOH. It was a robot talking, asking me to press 3 to be connected to an agent. Once connected with the agent it seems that person could only speak Mandarin, which i could not. Then the person hung up the phone.
Automated phone call claiming it was from MOH with urgent information and to press 3 for more details. Then a person came on the line speaking chinese, when i spoke english they hung up.
My encounter is similar to what was already reported here. I received a phone call from a man with "Indian" accent who claimed to be from Singtel.He said that I was having issues with my internet connection. The reason is because there are people misusing my internet for illegal stuffs. Hence, he is calling to offer troubleshoot services.I find this phone call strange. Firstly, he did not introduce himself. Secondly, there are noisy background sounds behind. It seems like this phone call is recorded or calling from overseas.I proceeded in asking him if he is calling from singtel. He said yes. I am not using singtel. He immediately hung up the phone.Lesson learnt is, if you received such calls, just hang up.Even if you are using singtel, there is no way singtel personnel would call you with regards to internet connection issues / they would not call without introducing themselves and they would provide you with singtel details instead. Stay calm and hang up the call.
1) Received a voice automated call from MOH asking me to follow Their instructions as there is urgent information required by me. 2) No money was lost
Got a call from the above listed number and on answering, I heard a robocall in English and Mandarin. Which went something like MOH singapore needed some urgent processing of my documents and instructed me to dial 3. I listened to the message twice and call got disconnected. Reporting this here it forewarn others.
Met ‘Lucas’ in coffee meets Bagel app. He claimed to be Thai and singaporean mIx, raised In UK And has a foreign accent. He claimed to be working in an oil rig, wife passed away 4 years ago from cancer and has a 12 year old son that his mom is looking after. He said he admired me, and that I was interesting and wanted to be friends. Exchanged numbers and called me once or twice daily to have short 10-15 minute Calls. On the 3rd day of our calls, i told him about my own divorce and money issues with my ex husband, and how i was very skeptical about scammers and dating online. After that, he stopped calling or contacting me, maybe he realised he had no chance of me giving him any money i didn't have myself. did a reverse image search on his profile photo and found that he used a Thai socialite’s photo in his profile.
I received a phone call from a lady with an 'Indian' accent who claimed to be from Singtel. She said that I was having issues with my internet connection etc. so I told her that Singtel will not call up customers like that. She then said to give her a chance to show me what's wrong with my internet and that it's a free troubleshooting service she'll like to provide. I also noticed an echo in the background every time I spoke through the phone, which was odd. It's as if the call was recorded? in the entire phone call, I was quite skeptical but I followed along and she proceeded to ask me to open my computer and asked me if I'm in front of my computer. Next, she requested that I tell her what's on my screen right now. Of course, at this point, I couldn't stand the nonsense and told her "it's okay, bye". I hung up and she didn't call back. When you received such calls, hang up. Telecos will not call their customers to inform them of issues relating to their internet connection.
I lost $800 to Loan scam. Got their contact via whatsapp and contacted them to find out more. Was told needed to take a small loan to prove that i am able to pay them back within a week. When i did transfer i was told that i made a mistake and that their system cannot clear my loan and needed to transfer again to clear it. Told them I cannot find the money and that's when the threats started. Made another transfer and after which he became uncontactable.

I received a phone call with an automated voice in English and chinese stating that i had an urgent document with MOH. When I pressed '3' as they requested, a Chinese voice came onto the phone asking me why I was calling. I said 'hello' in english and they proceeded to hang up on me. As this felt like a scam call I contacted MOH to verify if there were calls like these being made and if there were urgent documents of any kind pending. I was advised that there were no such calls being made at this time, and that i should contact the scam helpline to report it.
I happened to see some loan advertisement On facebook and decided to click and check out hup hoe credi? pte ltd and sgeasycredit. I was then directed to whatsapp by facebook where i was handled by these two companies. They mentioned that i could borrow sgd50k and 60 months repayment period of sgd900 per month (this interest rate is so low and even lower than banks). They then asked for the following information in order to process the loan: 1) ic front and back 2) income statement 3months latest 3) name card 4) 2 next of kin contact for application form 5) bank account I was so tempted but i then told mysef that i need to perform more research before giving my personal information. I then google and came across this scam alert website. After going through the website and past scam Stories. I then realised that i have possibly encountering loan scam. I could also find sgeasycredit in one of the past loaN scam story. One thing to Note, hup hoe credi? was listed in the registered money lender list too. I realised that the loan and Low interest offered are too good to be true. We have to keep reminding ourselves that there are no such goodies especially during this difficult time. They even wanted to call me in order to expedite the loan processing.

I received a robocall informing i have a summon pending which directed me to "Press 9" to speak to someone regarding the issue. Once I press gave the person my IC and name. I was told there is a complaint from "Singapore Interpol" for "Money Laundering" based on arrests made in China. I was taken aback, on further enquiry the person gave me some names which were totally unrelated to me &amp; asked if knew them. After denying that i knew them, i was told this case is pending &amp; i need to appear in court next monday upon which i will be arrested for questioning. Smelling something fishy, i insisted i will go to the nearest NPC &amp; sort it out. The person on call kept insisting, NPC won't be able to help as the complain has been launched by "Singapore Interpol" after this i didnt continue conversation. Politely, told him i need to talk to my lawyer and if there is any case he will be taking care of it on my behalf &amp; disconnected the line. Then rushed to the nearest NPC. They assured me this is a new scam recently going around to exhort money &amp; i don't need to worry as any such issue will always only be through police &amp; high court will never cut them off the loop &amp; intervene. Most of might know about this, still sharing so that it reaches all &amp; we don't fall for the scam.

I received a robocall from 65 68198822 and +65 68943861, the call claimed that a document is pending and that I should press a certain number to verify my number. I then received another call from +65 81880956, i initially DID NOT PICKUP THE CALL and when i called back - it was prepaid mobile number, which was unavailable. The incident happened twice in the past and today (16 apr 20). today the frequency of the calls was higher. the calls were received thrice within a span of 60 mins. To ascertain whether the calls were genuine, i checked with the moh hotline (1800 333 9999). the MOH operator checked their database and confirmed that the above numbers did not belong to their database. The operator also mentioned, that if a moh representative would reach out over the phone, it would be a person and not an automated voice response (AVR) system.

He then concluded the call by promising to get back to me. Editor's Note: This is a scam call and if you received a call similar to this, please hang up.
I got a call today... So, this caller (+65 6887 8888), he said that he's calling from Marina Bay Financial Centre. He claimed to be Tan Bun Yue - a staff of DBS main branch. He informed me that I applied for credit card in Beijing, China He went to to tell me the address that the card was registered to in China. He said i needed to pay $1,265 because there was a transaction in beijing, for an iphone xr I told him that I didn't go to Beijing. He then went on to comment that my personal details might be used illegally. he also says that the credit card number that apply in beijing was xxxx xxxx 8721 8600. but after end of call with tan bun yue, i call to dbs hotline, they say i have no card number xxxx xxxx 8721 8600. So this is a fraud case A total of 3 calls were made from these numbers 658770 8632 and 6568878888.
I received an automated message in english saying the call is from MOH and I have missed some important documents and asked to press 3 to proceed. \ When I pressed 3 the call got redirected to a male voice talking in MANDARIN and then the person hung up. I called back the number and the same person picked the phone claiming that he did not made any call.
Local number (+6566175816) played an automated recording in both English and Mandarin, claiming to be from DBS bank calling about an unnamed 'document'. instructed the receiver to press '3' for more information (I didn't press it because this is obviously a scam call and the number is not legitimate or found on any DBS website). The caller hung up after a while. i tried to call the number back to record the conversation but the local number is apparently 'invalid'.

I received a call from a lady with Indian accent called me to say that she is from singtel and they have detected abnormal behaviour from a third party accessing my internet which was slowing it down. right after her explanation, i knew this was a scam as in the first place im not using singtel. she told me that she is from singtel and have my details with her, so I told her that I'm not using Singtel, and how she got hold of my details? I asked her again where she from and because the way she spoke was very ' suspicious'. then she did not reply my answer and put down the phone.
I received a call claiming he is from Singtel and there is unusual activities on my Internet and 3 hackers are hacking into my connection right now. I asked him to verify himself and he mention he will give me his ID but I need to log in to my computer. I refuse and say I have no Computer as I find it fishy and he hung up immediately. He has a strong Indian accent and after that I call Singtel to verify that it is a scam.
I received a call on 14 April 2020 from this number +6595929665 asking me to press 3 to validate some documents for some Singapore Govt department. It was a robocall. I did not press 3 so I don't know what would have followed. Later I called that number and I got a number invalid message. It was similar to https://www.scamalert.sg/stories-details/Story-23Feb2020110035AM
A recorded message from "MOH" and asking me to press the number 3 to verify your phone number. this time is using English recorded message. after click 3, the guy simply hung up.
Received a call at 1.22pm today with number +65 8728 6859. picked it up and it was an automated voice call, first was in english which was not really audible, second was in chinese, saying that i had a document which was not collected from "MOH". I hung up directly without going further with some tell-tale signs, (1) government bodies will usually introduce themselves in full; ministry of health instead of moh. (2) the quality of the call was pretty bad, barely audible in fact. (3) how would I have any documents from the Health Ministry anyway?

I'm thinking to get a cheaper device for child to use for home based learning during this circuit breaker. Saw a listing from shopee, contacted this no. 87434674 through whataspp. I transferred $350 to OCBC xxx-1-073939, later seller message need insurance fee for delivery department to deliver the item and it is refundable upon delivery. I replied no more money in my bank, then asked to buy 2 SIM card to "waive" the insurance fee. bought 2 sim cards, asked to insert to phone and provide activation code and destroy the sim card. Seller never deliver item and requested to buy another sim card, stupid me continue to do as per request. asking seller when deliver, replied me "please appreciate the effort she putting in order to waive the insurance fee". I messaged seller going to make police report, seller replied "good luck". Made a police report, officer told me during this circuit breaker, this scam cases increased within a few days. Police officer told me this scam involved job scam, the bank account no. belong to another victim from job scam doing online job by transferring money in and out. scammer use the sim card bought by victim to list new online purchase through lazada, shopee etc. Police officer requested me to deactivate/disconnect all the phone no., all phone no cannot get through but still can receive message through whatsapp from scammer **to all the Potential victim, please "report seller" in shoppe immediately if you happened to see the sim card no.
A very confident-sounding guy called at close to 12 noon claiming someone was trying to hack into our computer. said he was from singtel and needed me to open up my computer to follow his instructions. I am security-trained so i was skeptical and asked for his name, id no. and address. he said his name was Alan Christopher, id no. 15787, from 5 maxwell road 0300 tower block mnd complex. he even said i could check his identity on my phone now. I called Singtel later and they confirmed there is no one working by the name of Alan Christopher
received an email with one of my frequently used passwords as subject title on 14 april. sender has stated that he got access to my password and more compromising photos/videos that he will send to 10 random contacts in my network if i do not comply with sending over $2000 (in bitcoin) to him within 24 hours of receiving that email. (it said that a computer code was inserted in the email so it will know when i have read it). it gave me 3 options: 1) pretend that it's a bluff and ignore, 2) reply with "proof" or 3) pay out $2000 to it via bitcoin. option 1 will lead to mailing video footage of me to current social networks and phone connections. the payment of $2000 is to wipe out everything it has concerning me. -------------------------- I have yet to transfer any payment and have deleted the email as per what other victims have done in this scam alert page.

Someone called me using number +6560362497, when i answered it, there was a recording saying they are from MOH (english, then MANDARIN) and asked me to press "3". When I did, a lady started speaking in Mandarin. Since I can't understand Mandarin, i asked her to speak in English. Then she hung up.
I received this whatsapp from this number 65 98957255 (SG mobile No.) Message reads: Good Day Sharon, Trust you are doing fine? I'm David Wong. You seem very much familiar to me. Guess we must have met before but can't recall where in Singapore. Guess we must have met one of the showflats in Singapore still can't remember. I was away during Lunar New Year. My mother was very sick in Australia. I'm trying to buy a house in Singapore for my sick mother. I don't know how you could be of a help. I need to know types of houses available, keep in touch. Regards" I asked &amp; he replied he is currently in Sydney and wish to buy a house in SG within budget of S$3mil to S$4mil. On 22-02-2020, gave his Aust mobile no. +61421816242 &amp; requested that we communicate via that. He shared his mom's poor health condition &amp; asked me to pray for her recovery. He asked about my job (realtor), hobbies/interests, etc. He sent me pics of him with 2 grown-up sons &amp; ex-wife, nice pics of his home's garden, charming pics of himself. His 2 sons &amp; ex-wife in US. His age is 63+ &amp; works as consultant. He said I'm his soulmate whom he enjoys chatting with. I'm always on his mind. He flew &amp; arrived in Florida (Jacksonville) on 02-03-2020 to settle some contracts with the govt office. He said he will fly to Singapore to meet me after he settled the important matters in Florida.On another day, he told me that his worker - Johnson Lee - will be in SG on 15-03-2020 to assist him in purchase of lubricant, jet oil, etc from ExxonMobil. On 16-03-2020, Jackson whatsapp from mobile no. +65 91574284 that he arrived in SG and had busy day on appointments with Exxon and Shell companies for purchases of Aero jet fluid, petrochemical oil, crude oil, etc. David then sent me Purchase Order with pics of various types of oil (see attachments) &amp; asked my help for S$14,500, as he is short of funds. I told him I don't have money to help him. He was upset &amp; called me heartless. He then reduced amount from S$14,500 to S$6,000 then to S$5,000 but I maintained that I do not have financial means to help him. He then turned angry &amp; blocked me from his WhatsApp. I am certain that Johnson is David's accomplice. I found Johnson's pics on facebook with name David Wong.While reading stories posted in ScamAlert website, I saw a story posted on 26 Nov 2019 that scammer Mok (56 years old) whose photo looks like same person as this scammer David Wong. I also found David Wong’s profile pics on Facebook but information given (such as From Hongkong, Lives in Singapore) are different from this scammer who told me that he's an Australian since birth. Please be wary of strangers who get in touch with you online.

A 'prospect tenant' named Zhu Lan contacted me on gumtree, Saying she a sg PR returning from overseas. In the initial email, the person send me 'her' ic S80779??G which at first seems like a sincere person looking for a room. However, the first red flag was tHAt she agree to everything very quickly, offering to rent the room and declining to view it personally when asked The person even offered to pay the rent of the first 6 months, as 'she' need to show the employer the proof of rent before she can quit her current overseas job as a cruise chef. The second red flag was when she asked me to register for a paypal account in a perfect and very well worded email The next thing was the whatsapp number 'she' provide was a +63 philippines number. on top of that she kept on shifting her moving in date over the next few days. on top of that due to the COVID-19 restrictions, she has to be quarantined at a govt designated facility and when asked, she deflected the question Only after i did some search did i come across the exact same scam happening to others the past few months. I am lucky to not have lost any money to this scam and was already thinking of going to the police report the impersonation of the person and illegal usage of the IC So beware If someone approaches you to give you months' of rental in advance with no questions asked

I'm sharing an encounter that I had today. I received a call with a name stamped "Daniel Goh GIC" telling me that I've an important document which I've yet to collect from MOH and asked me to press 3 to verify my phone number. It's an automated message with 2 languages, English followed by Mandarin. At first, I took it real for a moment as I heard "MOH", having in mind that "Oh no, is this a kind of like contact tracing?" I guess I'm paranoid about the pandemic and end up having selective listening. Was lucky that I spoke with hubby who was beside me and told me to hang up the call as should there be anything, MOH Officer will call me directly. Sharing this not to show how foolish I can be but more of alerting as many people as I could about scams around us which taking advantage of this challenging period that some time can impaired our objectivity.
I kept receiving phone calls from "DBS". I answered and dial number 3 as the phone menu suggest. after he said in Mandarin "this is DBS, how can I help you?" I asked "are you scammer from China?". The scammer started cursing me. Other numbers used: 92006943, 85091790
Received a call from someone claiming to be from the singapore high court. They knew my full name, including middle names, my fin number and phone number. They said I was due in court urgently on monday 13th april on money laundering charges related to the case of Christina Loh Mei Ling with case number 071875.After considering this information, I hung up the phone and called the High Court directly to check because it sounded like a scam. The high court general enquiries line confirmed this was a scam they were aware of and these details were not true. I didn't lose any further information or money, but was disconcerted by the fact that they already knew so much about me, including my fin number.

Due to the covid-19, I had lost my job. I was looking for some emergency aid. I browse through the internet and found this alltimecredit. I was told do give my personal particulars such as name, address and NRIC no. After about 30mins, the guy alias Alan, told me that my loan was approved but I had to pay some fees upfront. I was so happy and did not hesitate. I paid $35,500 in total and did not receive anything. I regretted and learnt my lesson in a hard way. One thing that taught me was this company do not even have a company phone number.So please beware before you apply for loans, make sure they have a valid office number.

Therefore, asked for refund, seller claim will transfer after verifying code was sent back to him. When done, no refund was received.
I first got an SMS on 1st april with the following text: 'Your delivery has been stopped at our depot. trk#cs279003594de intl #:INcs279003594de please resolve the issue here: httP://cftsl.com/eez (phishing site, do not click) I clicked on the link and paid via credit card $3.45 for a package i thought I was receiving from my brother in new zealand (this is because my brother had sent me a package from new zealand, but what I didn't realise is that the above mentioned text message came on my wife's number whereas my brother had given my phone number as the only contact number for the package he sent). the charge on my credit card statement showed the reference as 'quizine.sg +44 12 2498 0DK'. i recognised this charge and hence didn't pay heed to it. however, today when i checked my online banking, there was a charge of $49.95 dated 5th april on the same credit card with the same reference 'quizine.sg +44 12 2498 0Dk'. straight away i realised something was wrong. i blocked my credit card and here i am reporting this scam. i do not recall to the best of my knowledge/memory ever making this $49.95 payment in the last few days. Total money lost: $53.40 ($3.45 from 1st april transaction and $49.95 from 5th april)
Received a phone call by an heavily accented indian guy saying he's from Singtel technical service dept, claiming that 'suspicious activities' have been detected on my singtel internet account.

I hung up the call, sensing something was wrong and verified with Singtel customer service that no such calls have been made by them. Singtel will only call customers to resolve issues on their request. To all out there, please be careful of such calls, and it's seems to be quite common lately and they're repeating the same tactics over and over again.

i got an automated call from MOH asking me to dial 9 for some documents. this voice call is in english. after that it became chinese. i hung up the phone immediately. tel no was 69798393
Received a phone call from +6564385155, claimed that he is calling from ICA. The man sounds like a caucasian, then started to ask questions like how long i have been in singapore, and what am i doing here? I felt fishy and quickly passed the call to my husband. When my husband ask what is his name is, the man started to be aggressive and ask to give back to phone to me instead so he can continue his interrogations. The man started to say vulgar words "f..k u" , then we hanged up the call and blocked the number. We tried to call back the same number and found out that it was registered to a company in Singapore.Editor's Note: Scammers are using spoofing technology to create fake numbers to cover tracks and to fool people into picking up their phone calls. This means that the numbers displayed on users’ Caller IDs are often fake and untraceable, or belong to some innocent parties who didn’t make the calls. The more effective and long term solution is to educate users on how to spot the scam so that they don’t fall prey to them.
Received a call from +65 9777 7033 on 20 march at 11.46 am , answered by an automated voice saying that my tax returns got issues and a warrant had been issued for my arrest so i just hung up the call...
Automated voice call claimed that i have an urgent package from MOH and requested that i press 9 for more info then a chinese automated instruction of the same.
Received call on 20 mar 2020 11.14am, stated it is from MOH and said i have a document which i have not retrieved. Asked me to press '9' for more details. I do not believe MOH will call you using automated voice calls. It is impossible anyone simply have any document with MOH and sending voice message ask you retrieve. I just hung up after asking me press number.

We invested the money to this company doing crypto arbitrage for around 6 months when suddenly they freeze our account saying that we violate the rules which we didnt and affected more than 200 investors with total sum of up to 400k. Their office is at peace center and they still holding talks. Now all of us can't withdraw any amount out.
I'm going to share on how the scam works. I have tried this out of curiosity to experience what the victims are going through. The Credit for Sex Scammers usually don't have a local number tied to their advertisement, instead they will use a Line-ID or a WeChat-ID. The only way to connect with them is via these apps. They can advertise their services on Locanto, or Tinder or any other possible websites. The one I experienced was via Locanto, and was directed to add this person on WeChat. Upon contacting the "masseuse" or the "escort", they will pretend it is a legitimate proposition by asking you when you would like to meet them. Once you have given them a date and a time, they will ask for your location. The location I was given was “102 Yishun Avenue 5”. Upon arriving at the location, the girl will request for you to take a picture of your surroundings to indicate you have reached the meeting place. Next, they will ask you for your contact number so that their “friend” can contact you with further instructions and direct you to their actual location. Once you have given your contact number, their friend will call you via an Unknown or Private number, and ask you a series of questions. The questions asked will be whether or not this is your first time with this girl and if you have any friends or family who are in the police force. Once they have verified that this is your first time and that you do not have any connections to the police, this is when they will proceed with the scam. He will then ask you to pay a deposit of $100 or $200 for the services which you requested via an AXS machine, selecting the Top Up – Alipay option with their e-mail given to you by the girl via the messaging app. This is the first red flag! Once you have done so, you will be requested by the girl to take a picture of the receipt and send via the app. Next, the “friend” will then ask you to make a “refundable deposit” of $1,200 as this is their company policy. They will justify it by saying that the girl is a student and is doing this illegally, the money will be used to bail them out in the event they are caught and deported back. Do not transfer the money! Second red flag! Once you have rejected transferring the money, he will begin to threaten you by saying he have your contact number and will track you down and hurt your family. They will then negotiate with you by asking you to make a smaller amount for deposit. The girl will even call you on the messaging app to plead with you that it is for your safety. Stay calm! This is all a scam. Stop topping up nor deposit any more money and report to the police.
Met a guy in cmb his name is henry wong. Adopted by a russian foster dad raised up in moscow at the age of 3 when his singaporean parents died. Chat like around two weeks on wechat he was sweet and polite. He tried to send me his daily photos which is a very handsome guy but in summer clothes always while moscow is in winter now !! Claimed that he wanted to set up his own company as for a freelance architect after a few visits in sg. He back to moscow for a two weeks project and then will fly to sg to meet me. Even show me his flight booking. 5 days before his flight he was urgently called by his indonesia client for a building collapsed and need to fly there for investigation at once. Then he fight in the site and got injured. Asking to go for court and need 50000euro for compensation. Then i searched the internet and found the stories.

Caller is pretending to be MOH and that documents are pending and I could get the information by pressing 9. This is not funny during times of covid. No one wants to get a call from MOh these days as this would mean you might be linked to a suspected case. The scammer is making advantage of a crisis situation and has to be punished.
I just received a call from A MAN WITH A VERY HEAVY INDIAN ACCENT claiming to be from singtel. his no is 80379252. he mentioned that, I supposedly had many illegal devices connected on my internet. i asked him a lot of questions and he hung up.

Saw a drone in shopee (swiss limited), and was interested to get it. When i chat with the seller on shopee platform, an automated message saying "interested buyer please whatsapp to 92453326". I whatsapp him (HE NAMED HIMSELF "NAYA") and he said orders have to be directed to them as they are only using the shopee platform for advertisment. So after much convincing, i decided to trust him and transfer him $300 to his Malaysia acc (he claimed that their sg ocbc acc is down). He promised that the delivery will be the next day. The following day, he texted saying that they have run out of stock and will have to deliver from their malaysia store and that will cost another $300 for tax and insurance fees. I told him i can't pay so much, then he offered to help me pay $100 so i just needed to pay another $200, which will be refunded when they deliver the item. So i transfer another $200, but the item was not received on the same day. The following day (today), he claimed that their delivery van is spoiled, which caused the delay in delivery. He promised that the drone will be delivered today. After a while, he claimed that there is another issue and that will require me to transfer another $400 for stamp fees (WHICH HE CLAIMED WILL BE REFUNDED WHEN THE ITEM IS BEING DELIVERED). AT THIS POINT OF TIME, I KNEW it was a scam. Currently, i am in the process of contacting his boss (nor arian Binti Sama) to request a full refund. 🤞🏼
I met this lady on tinder stating that she is opened to making new friends followed by her Line ID. As my intention was to get to know how to commjnicate with ladies better, i decided to message her. In our conversation she didnt mentioned anything about the amount needed to pay to meet up with her. So on 18 March 2020, the date we decided to meet, she asked me to give her my contact number for her 'friend' to give me a call regarding their procedure of meeting up. And there were a few calls made by 2 different persons without any caller ID. Through our conversation, they have requested for me to transfer first $100 followed by $600 and $1000 done via alipay on the axs machine. When they asked me transfer the $1000 i was feeling abit suspicious about the conversation and decided to transfer $300 claiming that I do not have sufficient amount to transfer the full $1000. And in our last call, after I raised the concern about not being able to transfer the remaining $700 and requested for the refund of a total of $1000, he began to threatened me saying that If I were to pull anymore tricks, they would come and haunt me and my family. Note to all other individuals who are going to experience this scam: 1. Check if any payment is needed to be paid upfront before meeting up. If yes, dont bother meeting up with the other person. But if you still insist on wanting to meet up check the amount to be paid first 2. When you are asked to give your phone number for her 'friend' to call you, do not ever give your phone number 3. Once it reached the threatening phase, request for the longest possible timing to look for funding and take this opportunity to go and make a police report.
i received a call on 18 March 2020 at around 4.08pm. Its and automated voice message that says something like, " this call is from MOH.

I found an ipad pro seller (nor arian binti sama) through Shopee and approached the seller (thinking that shopee should be a legit site) she asked to deal direct with her (which I shouldn't) and I agreed. she promised me it will be delivered within 24 hours after payment is made. i paid through internet banking then when i didn't receive it the next day, they told me it's because i haven't paid insurance tax which will be refunded to me when i receive the item. i argued with them but they showed me screenshots of conversation with past customers to prove that what they said is true. I transferred another 300 and it is still not delivered the next day. then i know it's definitely a scam. I lost $800 in total.
First comes an automated voice stating that I am being summon to the high court, press 9 for more details. Please hang up and block, many of such cases has already happened with different numbers.
On monday 16 March 2020 at 14:10hrs, i received a call from this number ‭+65 8445 3872‬. A chinese speaking lady (clearly a mainlander) claimed she is calling from the customs at Changi airport and that i have a parcel from overseas. She didn't verify any of my details (including name or address) and did not provide me more details and when i asked her to speak to me in english, she Hesitated. I immediately hung up the call and never got a call back since. I was expecting Some parcel from overseas for online shopping but they do not require special customs clearance so i reckoned it must be a scam. I didn’t give any details to her and no money was lost. Please be aware.
Received a call from 63919684 at 324 pm on march 17. started with a voice message that changi customs calling - first in english and then in mandarin. followed by a male mainland accented chinese voice asking for my name and phone number. on questioning the male voice said I had shipped ten thousand masks to a mr wang in beijing. I suspect this was leading to some money scam asking for customs duty or something. i then asked for an english speaking staff member after the male voice sounded agitated when i did not provide my mobile number in chinese accurately, accusing me of not knowing my number. what a scam! When i started speaking in english that was when he hung up.
I was doing my own work when my phone rang. The number was a person that I have not made a contact of.

I received a phone call today afternoon (16 Mar) from an indian guy saying he is from microsoft support team. he is calling from +65 9359 2721. he first asked whether my name is correct and continued to say they received email notifications that my computer has issues, so microsoft called to help me resolve that issue. he wants me to go to my computer so he can guide me step-by-step on how to resolve that issue. that raised my suspicion so i questioned what exactly is the issue and how this issue came about. he replied saying it is because my computer don't have firewall thus it increases risk of having my password and sensitive information being leaked. thus he will need to guide me step by step on my computer and gain remote access to my computer to fix this. like hello? i confirmed have firewall in place and giving you remote access is super dangerous, you can really then access all my password and sensitive information! i rejected going to my computer and he wont give up by saying that he wants to schedule an appointment with me to resolved this issue. i said i was busy and hang up. afterwards i search official microsoft website on whether they will do this, turns out even on the official website, microsoft warns against having their staff calling customer for computer issues as their software are ASSURED against these type of technical issues. everybody beware!
Got a phonecall from 80184014 at 1600hrs today. Claiming himself from being Customs that I have a shipment of fake masks in China under my name
I first received a phone call from a girl with Indian accent who claimed to be sophie soon from microsoft tech support team. She had my name, Email and number. She told me that there were problems with my computer but I told her that I didn't experience any problem and my computer was new. She said she will show me the PROBLEMs. After receiving multiple calls from her, I relented as I did an old computer which was problematic and I sent a diagnostic report to Microsoft. She asked me to run a series of codes via the command box and fooled me into thinking that there was a problem with my computer. I later found out that the "problems" existed in all computers. She then wanted to gain remote access to my computer and I felt uncomfortable, so I questioned her identity and she gave me all except for her company phone number. I grew suspicious and CONTINUEd to question her about THe number she used to call me. She immediately transferred my call to her supervisor, a guy with indian accent who was more adept at talking. I granted remote access although I felt uncomfortable and he started running diagnostic tests on my computer. He then asked for my name, billing address, email and phone number which I thought they should already have. I divulged everything excerpt for my billing address. I then called Microsoft to verify while they had remote access to my computer...I managed to abort the connection when they tried install something on my computer by accepting risks. They then made another 10 calls to my phone which I did not pick up. Although I have reinstalled windows on my computer and ran a few antivirus scans, I'm still worried that they may misuse my information out of revenge or installed any trojan in my computer.

a man with a very heavy indian accent called me on my mobile and said my home internet has issues. he even identified his employee id that starts with c and ends with 190 (but since I was on MRT, I wasn't able to note it down). I told him i was in mrt and he said he would call me back later and hung up
I receiVed a call from this number claiming that my singtel internet has been compromised. The caller was an indian ladyand she said that the call would be recorded. This is similar to the singtel Marketing calls that i have received the day before and so i trusted them. The caller Told me to go to my computer to check and even gave me directions to press my Windows key on my keyboard. However upon questioning what this wifi check entailed they hung up on me.
I saw a part time/full time job advert on carousell. i cant remember his Carousell account as i didnt keep record.i wanted to look for extra income so i actually went to click onto the link and it linked to his whatsapp number +65 8697 1085. his ic no : s894105?? pan houro?? , samuel. on last saturday , 7th mar , he replied me. our conversation was too long. he mentioned this job is flexible and i can do it where ever there is a post office in the area. he also said he wished to meet up with me but he is in new york as an architect and will come back to singapore in june. the whole message sounded real. i was required to mail the packages/mails to where he wants me to mail them to. the content of the packages will be business/personal mails. he will pre pay me first and work less than 15/20 hour per week and get more than $200 as an account personnel. he also mentioned its 101% legal and real job. i sent him my ic and bank acc as he requested. on monday , he used different bank accounts with different names to transfer me $2650 without telling me beforehand that he will transfer. when he already transferred, it was already too late for me to report. he also said he will email me offer letter one week later. he told me to transfer $2630 to Mifeng’s DBS account. I did it at atm machine on the same day on tuesday , he transferred me $1849 and i was told to transfer $1840 to 2880169??-? lim seow h?? DBS, but that time I was working and he kept on pestering me and when I went to ATM machine after work , i realised my posb acc has been frozen by the police. I was so stressed because of him and the police officer told me to wait for his call and he will tell me when to come down for statement. I really thought that this was a real job because everything sounds real. so currently his money and my savings are stuck in my account and I was so helpless.
Dear sirs,Yesterday and this morning, I received a call on my mobile with an automated voice message informing me that the caller was from DBS bank and that my account is having some inconsistencies and my account will be close immediately. If i want to know more details to hit a certain number. I immediately cut off caller since i am alert about such scams. Had reported a singtel scam to both the council and the police some mid 2019.I reported yesterday's scam call to DBS and their customer service confirmed it was a scam call since they have no record of the bank calling me.The 2 numbers that called were:Yesterday: 65 6369 5008 This morning: 65 8841 3640.
Another phone line used to impersonate dbs. Also using chinese language
Been receiving calls from this nUmber claiming to be from DBS. It is an automated call in chinese. Knowing that DBS will not use automated voice call to call their customers or in Mandarin, I hung up.

I picked up a call from voice call record from " Singapore high court" then i got connected over to an indian sounding guy. he said that i have a case then transferred me over to a chinese sounding high court case officer by the name of james tan. i talked to them for a while. he said that this call is recorded and for verification he needs my full name and ic. then, i told them. he said i was part of china money laundering by Interpol suspect tan mei yan.
1) how it happened:On march 10, 2020, 17:14pm, this man by the name of Roger Davis called my handphone.His incoming number is 91304481. (singapore line)He says he is calling from company: imda (infocomm media development authority) of singapore.He has a strong indian-speaking accent as he was conversing in english with me.He says their technology system has detected that my computer is having damages in "tools and services".He informed me that he will need to access my computer and help to solve the issue.If i did not get it check, my computer will get hacked easily due to no security services, and i will lose important info like financial info in my pc.I asked which computers, saying that i have many computers. He said "the personal computer".Actually, my computer has no problem. And i am amazed that they know "which computer is personal" or "which computer is for business". So this is already a fishy part.To add on, a few weeks ago, some other man called my mobile too about the same computer issue.He says he is calling from MicrosoftHe also has a strong indian-speaking accent.So i suspected they are from the same syndicate, citing big corporate names to fool the public.Nothing was lost. Because i thought it was too suspicious and did not divulge any confidential information.I did not continue the conversation upon having suspicions.
This person with an accent that sounded from india called me at my handphone number using the phone number +6563107171 and asked for 'jack' (not my name). i told him that he looked for the wrong person, and he repeated my number to me, then he asked me to pass to the right person. So i asked him what is this phone call purpose in regards to? he CLAIMED TO BE FROM SINGTEL, and told me that someone bad is trying to access to my internet connection, and to prevent that, he advised me to sign up for protection. so i asked him to send me an email regarding this "protection" plan that he has. And he hysterically became bad tempered and started scolding me on why should he send me an email if i am not the right person. several alert ringed me that he is a scammer: - he looked for 'jack', and i believe my handphone number have been with me and no one named 'jack' ever got hold of this number for the past 2 decades - i do not have any personal internet subscription with singtel so while he was still berating me on the phone, i gave up listening to him, and gave him a warning: i know that you are a scammer and i will report you to the police, then i hanged up after hanging up, i went online to look up at the phone number, and i realized that the phone number could be from india.
pls note this number +61392798868 from Australia, pretending to be from singtel. the caller said "hi, this is deeraj from singtel, calling you regarding your home internet" my home internet is not singtel. i hung up.
Be aware of the scare-tactics they are deploying
i met Thomas Peter Huang via the league app, the app that declares verifications are in place to ensure there would not be any fake profile in their app. Name: Thomas P Details: Woodland, 45 years old, 180cm Education: University of Aberdeen and University of Texas at Austin and a PhD holder. Profession: Self-independent contractor – Perenco (later he deleted “Perenco” from his bio) Verified: Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter Interests: Cycling xxxx (I couldn’t recall the details) | The Great Gatsby | Mayor of Casterbridge He mentioned that he is an engineer in petroleum industry and he would be heading to Kiev, Ukraine soon for his project. During his trip, he hoped we could continue to talk and get to know each other before we meet face to face. He shared that he was the only child and chose a simple life. His parents passed away and he is on his own. It was a very convenient story to tell. My suspicion started to arise when I could not find him in any platform that verified him. he declared that he had left the league app. Thankfully, I was still in the app. One day accidently I saw another profile on the app. The face was different with Thomas, but the bio was 90% match. When I say match, it means every wording is a match. It includes university they went for study, favourite food, their interest in books and cycling. I am not sure if Thomas used this guy’s bio or both are fake profiles. One day he shared his contract document with a company that he claimed to be his client. He said it was confidential document, but he trusted me enough to share it with me. He used this trick to show that he was real, yet there was a few mistakes in the documents: 1. The company doesn’t seem to have any subsidiary in Ukraine as it was claimed to be. 2. The company address on the letter head is an abandoned building in Ukraine. 3. There was no name of director who signed the contract. 4. There was no company logo on the letter head. 5. Lastly, there was typo in the document. A few days later, he mentioned there was a cyber glitch around the rig where he was working. He asked me to switch to hangout app as his phone number and WhatsApp will be monitored for safety precaution. he could access hangout app because the app uses email instead of phone number. When I asked him about his linkedin account, he explained that he deactivated his account. I reported and blocked his number on WhatsApp. I also contact the league help support to report a scam. I gave all details about Thomas, and the profile of the guy whose bio has 90% match with Thomas. thomas might be a vip member in the league. Hopefully the league can trace him through his payment detail.

happened when i got a random line chat popping up with a female profile, very quickly i was offered sexual services and asked for phone number. received a call from a 'friend' of hers, who demanded i make transfer of $100, which is when i realised it is a scam attempt, i hung up on the call, but this girl started sending violence photos of people saying that they will track and hunt my family, so i answered another call from them which is full of threats towards my family and i. By then i was feeling afraid so decided to just send them the $100 they asked for a peace of mind, but then it escalated to $600 more, i figured it's fine as long as everyone is safe. but even after that, he asked for more so i just blocked them altogether. all these were done so even without leaving my house, through the axs app.

However, he had issues transporting his expensive equipment and one of it was damaged and held custody in turkey. Wanted to borrow 5,000 and i declined Thereafter, i did a google image search on the photos he had given me and it was linked to a doctor based in malaysia. That's how i knew i was tricked.

I matched this girl "carrie" on tinder, who offered 2hours for $100. so i agreed to meet, the moment i got there, i RECEIVED a call from a china man. he instructed me that the girl was a student, and needed protection, thus asking me to transfer some money by buying the mycard points on axs machine, which would be refunded after the services. after i did so On the $600, i was instructed to transfer yet another $800, which i only transferred $200 as I was starting to feel odd about the whole affair. After that, i started receiving death threats, telling me how they would find me through my handphone number and kill my family and i. i've proceeded to block and ignore all their calls/messages. PLEASE DO NOT LET YOURSELVES GET INTO SUCH SCAMS.
I've seen this a lot of times recently, this is the third time a friend of mine was impersonated, all on instagram. The first time, it was my boyfriend's mother (her instagram username was xxxx, they changed it to caroline_teo???), the next time it was a friend i haven't spoken to in ages (Amanda?? to amandaa??) and the third time, was a girl i hadn't spoken to in awhile as well (hoyeex to hhoyeex). These are really common, and they often choose usernames that are really similar, and difficult to detect if they are false. Of course, this is partially due to the accounts being public, thus letting them copy the pictures. The first time they asked for my phone number (i gave it because i thought it really was my boyfriend's mum), and asked if i could give my bank account details and click an SMS link. Thankfully, my account is a uk number, and thus i did not receive it- i do not think the message could send. I thus kept the conversation going to try and figure the identity of the scammer, but all i managed to get was that he spelled singapore as sinapur, and was thus likely from india (their cities spell 'pore' as 'pur'). The second time they did not message me, and the third time, they asked for my phone number (i gave the police number), of which they said they sent an sms code to it, and asked me to send it to them to verify. As i 'played' with them to try and get more information since it was evidently a scam, they accidentally typed some words in romanian, and deleted it a few seconds later. I tried to continue the conversation but they ignored me afterwards. No money was lost in any of these three situations, but the cases really are on the rise, so i thought it'd be nice to perhaps inform and warn more people of such scams. Thanks!

selling a high-end laptop via gumtree. buyer named "brightmoon" contacted me on chat and is annoyed when response is not immediate. he asked me to communicate with him via whatsapp instead. his name on whatsapp is "futureisbright". he claims he is from singapore but uses a malaysian number for whatsapp as he previously worked in malaysia. he said he is a serious buyer and wanted to purchase the laptop. claims that he is offshore and wants to purchase the laptop for his daughter. offered to transfer funds first and get a courier to pick-up the laptop. i said i usually deal person-to-person only, but agreed to it as he needs to purchase urgently before his daughter goes to camp. following morning, he provides screenshot of bank of america transaction claiming he has transferred the funds and has been deducted from his account. even provided a screenshot of his bank account (now, who does that? seriously?) i said I will not release the laptop until the funds are properly reflected. he starts accusing me of pulling a fast one on him and that he trusted me. no funds have been received. noticeably, his responses are far in between, which only means he is busy scamming other people while communicating with me. his bank of america screenshots have misspellings and inconsistencies. never release or ship your products on sale unless you are properly paid.

I received a phone call on my house telephone. The scammer first introduced himself, saying that he is from Singtel and he is calling with regards to an issue with my house internet broadband service. Next he would go on to ask if i am the owner of the line, the one who is paying for the internet services, i played along and said yes as my mum wasn't home. i had asked what is this regarding a couple of times throughout the phone call, he would simply reply there is an issue with your internet broadband sir. The next thing he wanted me to do was get on my computer, give him remote access to it and he wanted to "Verify" i'm the owner by logging into my internet banking account and show him the statements of which i have made the payment in previous months. Immediately i told him i would not do so and if need be i will go down to a Singtel retailer shop to clarify the issue. right after i said that he just hung up on me, without saying another word.

Didn't take immediately because he want to arrange small loan 1st OF $500 and repayment within few days of $800 for record of transaction and promise to give back $300 after agreement of $50000 sign. Text again couple of days then initial amount increase to $700 and repayment of $1000 need to be made. Received $700 and about to pay notice from this website same guy already scam others. So refuse to pay $300 AND return back the $700 but this guy seem unhappy and ask me to pay $1000 to cancel which is in black and white. So police report done.

25/02/2020 @0919 hours, received call. Automated lady voice VERBALIZING " This is from DBS, your Account has been violated." Before it CONTINUED any further I cut the line. The only thing spoke to this call was Hello on my side.
I received a call saying that they caller was from ica and that the call was a 3 way call with the ica rep, surveillance team and me. They said that i am being deported out of singapore due to indian consulate making a claim of some criminal offence against my name. When i said i know this is a phishing call. The caller (guy 1) got aggressive and started to threaten me that he will send the cops to where-ever i am. They collected my nric, passport number, my house address, how many bank accounts i have and the amount of money i have in it. Which incidentally is negligible and then they started asking me if i had credit cards. And then the line was pass to division officer (guy 2) who said threatened to deport me again and then gave me 3 options to choose from quoting clause 18 a, 18 b and 20a. 20a required that i pay a fine of 5000 sgd. I said i do not have the money and then they said without that i would be sent back. When i agreed to pay the guy 2 asked me to go to a 7-11 and get a google play card worth 5000sgd. After this the line was passed to the 3rd guy who was to take me through the payment process. The 3rd guy first asked me if i had a debit card, to which i said, i had it but i have no money in my bank to use it. He then said please go to the nearest challenger. At this point i suggested that i go to ica building which is closer to where i was and i can make the payment there. They insisted that i do not do that as i can be detained there and instead go to a challenger. I used the time to walk over to challenger as an excuse to get to the nearest police station and lodge a complaint about it. They referred to some alien number not updated when i had first entered in singapore and that i would need to update it. And that the ica office would come over to my house to get this number updated. They refused to let me disconnect the call. And stayed on the call with me for 2 hours plus and during that time if the call would get disconnected they would call me back immediately.

I received multiple calls in the morning from a person, who is claiming to be from ICA. He said that my visa is expired and i have to be deported due to a wrong doing, which i dont know. He said I will be not allowed to enter to singapore for 5 years. After that he asked for my passport details. At this point i realised its a scam. So i asked him to report to the local police station and hung off the phone. Please don't be fooled by these scam calls. Always verify the authenticity of the calls and don't provide personal information over the phone.
The call was received 25 feb 2020 at 6:55am and the caller posed as an officer from "cyber security agency of singapore" saying that it's about my ip address on the internet. caller had indian accent, and the phone number above was reflected on caller id. I suggest that the sg police set up an secure online form that is shared with telco providers, so that such telephone numbers can be instantly alerted for scams and reported, to prevent innocent victims from being scammed.Editor's Note: Scammers are using spoofing technology to create fake numbers and the numbers that appear on users' Caller IDs are often untraceable, defunct, or belong to some innocent parties. Instead of focussing on the numbers, the more effective solution is to learn how to identify a scam call. In the above case, the one clear red flag is for an Agency to call a resident at random and asking for her IP address.
received a call claiming to be from Singtel. There was lot of background noise at the caller's side. She said she has information regarding my singtel internet connection. i don't have a singtel connection, to which she said singtel runs all the internet infrastructure in singapore (ok!!) She said singtel has information that someone (hackers!) are trying to connect with with my PC and that it is unsafe and they can steal all my data and bank information....she said i can verify this through the netstat command on my windows command prompt (which i typed in and show local address, foreign address...blah blah). next she said she verify all these connections by connection to singtel server and she will guide me through the process (yea right!) at that point, i asked to her stop and i'm not interested and if there is a serious threat, you can ask singtel to write to me formally...not over a phone call.

I was contacted by Thomas via a new dating app known as The League. The League apparently does a background verification on everyone's profile by checking with social media platforms like facebook, linkedin and instagram.Anyway Thomas reached out to me via the app after we matched on Feb 10, 2020 and I responded on 14th. His dating profile suddenly disappeared right after we exchanged numbers so i am unable to view his league profile anymore but he resurfaced again on whatsApp after a few days, Feb 15. He claims he is local Singaporean Chinese who spent quite a number of years in the UK (both studies and work) and that he lives in Pinnance Duxton here in Singapore. He is apparently, working in the petroleum industry and is due to travel tomorrow to Kiev, Ukraine for work soon. We have been talking to each other via whatsapp for the past 9 days. However my instincts tells me something isn't right. When he started h he was very chill and laid back, saying he wants to take his time and since he is away for business that would give us more time to get to know each other virtually until his return.What is odd about him is after just chatting for a few days, that he started sharing about his secret wish for me to fly to Kiev with him, assuming if we had met earlier. His m.o. completely changed drastically from Sat, Sun to recently and he started talking about having years to spend time with me and to understand me, stating that my happiness was his utmost priority in life. He even proclaim that he has even deleted his dating profile at The League to solely focus on me and his work. This is all singing a different tune from the weekend where he wanted to take things slow because he was burnt badly from his past relationships.This morning, i decided to do a test and called his Whatsapp number. It was an automated voice to say that this number is uncontactable and invalid. I confronted him when he texted me over lunch today and he got all weird and upset. He even accused me of being a crazy woman to call him out of the blue and making assumptions that he is a fake. Just wanted to see if anyone has seen him on any other dating apps/social platform and also be warned not to be duped.I have not lost anything just time and some personal info that is not important. Pls do not continue the conversation after realising that the person is a scammer.
Seem a company using Lazada as the platform, informed me that I had won a price, Samsung Galaxy S10 plus. In order to claim this, I only have to pay S$1.00. unsuspecting, I just pay, giving details of your credit card information and include CVV number. There after they sent you an email, informing you now a VIP member of Bushid?, enjoy ING games, but if you read further down, the long terms n conditions they said every 3 months membership expires, n they will deduct your credit card S$49.50. until you officially terminate membership. I was one of them who fell to the greed of the prize. I sensed something not right. I immediately cancel my credit card replaced it with a new one. They later send me an email confirming cancellation. Checked the terms and conditions before signing up!

I sensed something is wrong. I asked the man the telephone number of cyber security department. I checked the number is wrong. I hang up the call immediately. Hope this help people be more aware of scammers tricks and techniques. Together we can fight this scammers.
Hello. I received a call from +65 6287 7843 ar 10.01am this morning asking me to check my DHL package but I do not have a DHL package. So i just ended the call with a real person talking at the other end that sounds like Chinese person.
CAME ACROSS the same scammer on CMB in late dec 2019, WENT by the name of jason chan or jason wong. said he's in architecture, is based in moscow, adopted by russians at age 3 and plans to open co. in singapore once license approved (red flag 1). gave sob story of having no friends he can trust except for a foster dad in nursing home (red flag 2), wrote extremely long messages showering &amp; professing love too quickly (red Flag 3). tries too hard to earn your attention and trust. the final straw came when he's called to indonesia all of a sudden as a building he erected COLLAPSED, was beaten up by locals and needed to pay eur50,0000 in compensation. His bank account was frozen, managed to borrow some money from his lawyer and needed help to make up the remaining 6k eur within 48h or face jail charge. A complete nonsense. Have since blocked his contact &amp; saw others reporting the same story here for around the same period. raising awareness that this scammer is still at large on cmb!!

First, they will msg you and call you to ask you to pick up loans. Its kinda weird when u search on the net for loans and they have your number when you put on the website for enquiry. Seems like they shared the same database. They will ask you to take up attractive loans and tell you that they couldn't transfer you and ask you to make a small loan to activate your account. Its a never ending thingy. Go to legal moneylender is better
I received a call by a lady with a slight indian accent claiming to be from singtel. (the voice was a bit weird, like it was slightly COMPUTERIZED?) the lady was calling me regarding singtel broadband services. I told her i wasn't using singtel. She went on to say that she "knew" and that "did you know that all broadband services go through singtel broadband? m1,starhub, etc." then she started going on about how they receive all my private data through notifications, and how the current broadband i use was not safe or secure. this happened when i was at work, and i was lazy to entertain them, so i just hung up.
Received an automated call (from Number: 86257306) claiming DBS system is down and accounts have been locked. after i hung up, received another automated call (from number: 83066668) claiming the same thing. Then, i hung up and i redialed both numbers. the first number keeps saying "The M1 customer that you are calling is currently unavailable" repeatedly. The second number keeps saying "The singtel mobile customer is currently not available, please try again later". if really bank calls, first not from automated system. second, unlikely you cannot return a call. Please bear in mind. and don't fall for their tricks.
I just received this email threatening to expose my personal details, phone number and my family and friends contacts if i do not send them $500 in 46 hours.
Automated call claiming to be from DBS saying that you've an urgent mail and to press 8 to find out more.
I have recently started to use Lazada to buy online. Usually i would receive sms from lazada to inform me of my online purchase delivery. Two days ago, i received a sms from lazada informing that i am a winner of their January lucky draw. Since it was the same SMS that Lazada used to inform me of delivery, i did not suspect it will be a scam until i clicked the link. The link led me to a survey and questions seems legit. Next it prompted me to select the color of the phone. Then delivery option either ninja van or singpost. Ninja is free whilst singpost cost $2. Naturally i chose ninja but it says it is not available. Thus i need to use singpost and pay the $2. Then i was lead to provide my credit details. At this stage, i became suspicious and decided not to complete the transaction until i verified with lazada if this is a genuine promotion. I was informed by Lazada that this is a scam and that they have received high volume of report. What puzzle me is there is no such warning in lazada site nor did they report about a hack on their website. Obviously my personal details have been given. But 2 days have passed, but no report or action from Lazada.
Guy called me, @12:39pm, saying he needed to update my information from ica. I quite don't understand what he is trying to say. I kept asking from what company is it. He said ICA. He needed my account details or else my account will get suspended. So I told him, go ahead and suspend it, I will not give any information from you. Then he hung up. Then I just realized at the same time he called, there was an SMS I received saying "Dear client your account's one time password is "2243". Kindly be informed that this password is valid for 10 minutes after GENERATING" He was obviously trying to access my information. I noticed scam calls like these because they came from uae mobile number which are just coming from ordinary people. I hope by giving his number will trace this scammer from its hole trying to victimized other people.
I receive a call just recently from a man who claim he's from singtel and that he was calling to warn me that there are some anonymous stranger that were using my wifi. From his accent I can tell he was an indian national. I almost believed him because it almost sound genuine until he asked me to access my computer device. That's when I realised that there was something off and end the call. When my dad called back to check, the phone number is not valid.

I purchased kids surgical mask on Ninelif?.sg on 30/1 and payment has been made on the spot via Paypal. Order confirmation received. I just noticed that the merchant name on Paypal record is Headrus? Ventures Pvt Ltd. I followed up with the status on 4/2 and received reply from Sonali (Ninelif? UK) mentioned the product has been procured. She assured me will deliver it to me when it arrives Singapore. On 12/2, nothing has been received. I emailed them again to follow up on the status. Besides, I have also called to Ninelif? SG for many times but it went to voice mail. I even called to Ninelif? UK, but no one was picking up the calls. Till date, I have not heard from them and nothing has been received. I'm sure I had been scammed. Editor's Note: Masks and hand sanitizers are in high demand. Please be wary when buying these items online. Avoid advance payments or use platforms that offer escrow services to prevent getting scammed, and do research on the company or seller before transacting with them.
He called me and claims his from DBS, he called through Whatsapp. He told me too update my card otherwise i'll l be blocked. He asked me about the first digit of my card. And then he asked me to send a picture of my debit card front and back. So i played along through the phone call. I acted as if i didnt know whats happening but i knew. So i told him to Whatsapp me instead as I was working and unavailable to call him. So he Whatsapp me. Please share this with your loved ones and friends. Editor's Note: Please do not entertain unknown calls from companies, especially through unconventional channels such as WhatsApp or VIBER, asking for personal and bank details (including One-Time-Password), or threatening you with account termination

I received this email and thought it was from starhub. It mentioned that i had overpaid for my bills and they will like to refund back the $60++ to my hubby credit card and asked for his credit card details, which i provided. Later the bank called to inform that there were overseas unauthorized transactions ( as we did not activate the card overseas usages ) and we were asked to terminate the card, which we did. According to the bank, there was abt sgd$600++ unauthorized transactions.
I first reply to a whatsapp. The loan seems simple enough- 10K loan and a repayment of $450 per month. Like a fool i forwarded the requireD documentS - IC BACK AND FRONT, passport ID, BANK ACCOUNT DETAIL AND NEXT OF KIN CONTACT. Jeff, the man on the phone, said company will transfer $500 and I have To do an $800 transfer - to ensure smooth transaction between myself and co &amp; to show that I have $ to pay. That was the start of me wanting to cancel. Then I ask for some form of Id, which i did not get. That was when I knew it was a scam. I cancelled my request. Again and again. Jeff ignored my request and proceeded to transger the $500. Shocked, i made a police report. Went to my baNk to return the money to the above sender. Everything is in process as I am typing this!! They will ask you to do a direct transfer saying it is faster. Dont. Let the bank handle this. I hope They will not disturb me ever again. Please, never send your private info over the phone!!! Now they have my address. i have alerted my home security people at the guardhouse and hook up with the police for Security. My neighbours roughly know the Situation and are on alert. Thank goD we look out for one ANother here. I have camera placed where i need to, connected to an alarm. At the press of a button and help is on its way, the first person being all your next door neighbours. They are the most important people aT time like this. I pray for my family’s safety....down the drain goes my peace. Please, avoid them at all cost.

Very heavy indian accent sounding and noisy background. claimed to be technicians from singtel. said that my router is having problem but couldn't tell me what was the problem. asked if i have any slow down or disconnection over the pass 2 weeks (which commonly people would say yes). I said no, and thanked them for their excellent service. kept asking me how many lights are blinking on the router and I kept asking them if it's the yellow ones or the purple ones. My big reveal to them was i'm on Starhub. then......... *end tone

Received a called from a singapore phone number, looked legit, and they said that as a DBS BANK client, MY ACCOUNT WILL CLOSE IN the next 2 HOURS IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING (ENGLISH AND CHINESE LANGUAGE USED). I did not understand the request in english as i have busy at the time.
I received a whatsapp phone call from +92 301 947 6860 (pakistan number) being told my credit card would be blocked unless i gave him my name, nationality and account number. The man on the end of the phone said he was from the technical investigations department in singapore and that his name was abdullah. I did not give any information away.
Received an automated/ recorded message from a local landline number (+65 6898 9295) from 'Singapore State High Court' informing me that i have failed to appear in court for a summons and to press 5 to speak to an officer about the case. I pressed 5 and was transferred to somebody pretending to be from the high court and they requested me to confirm my name and IC in order to provide details of the summons (which i was completely not aware about). i told them i would not provide my name for personal data security reasons, and they then said it is important and i should make an urgent appointment at the high court at Havelock square to be provided with if i do not want to provide my IC over the phone. It was 8.30am on Monday and i was about to reach the office so reluctantly confirmed my name and IC (and nothing else). I was then told a story about a summons for a phone bill unpaid for 2 years. i was then told the fake number and that the phone was registered in my name. I was then told there was a connected case being investigated by China Interpol. this was regarding a suspect named Tan Fue Yi who had been detained in Beijing with a bundle of ATM cards and one of them has my name on it. i was told she is suspected of money laundering and that i should cooperate with Singapore Interpol to clear my name and help the Chinese with their investigation. I was then given a case number and transferred to supposedly Interpol where an officer introduced himself as officer CAVIN who requested me to confirm my IC and name and provide case number and details of the case (the story I'd just been told) in order to record my version of events for the record. He then requested to meet him at Interpol with my IC and passport to sign my report and for him to escort me to the Chinese embassy to assist investigations. again this was urgent and he suggested i try to meet him within the hour. about 90 minutes later I arrived at Interpol to be informed there is no officer Cavin and to report this scam to the local police.

Below is the email details: "FINAL WARNING! You have 46 Hours in order to make the payment. (I have a Facebook pixel in this email, and at this moment I know that you have read through this email message). If I do not get the Bitcoin, I will certainly send out your files and video recording to all your contacts including relatives, coworkers and all contacts. Having said that, if I receive the payment, I'll destroy all files and videos immediately. If you need evidence, reply with "Yes" and I will certainly send out your video recording to your 6 contacts. It is a non-negotiable offer, Don't waste my personal time and your by responding to this message. I'm a Hacker who cracked your devices. I set up a malware on the adult video (p0rn) website and guess what, you visited this site to have fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching videos, your internet browser started out functioning as an "HRDP" Hidden Remote Desktop Protocol which gave me accessibility to your screen and web camera. After that, my software program obtained all your contacts and files. What did I do? I generated a backup of your every system (private document files, video, photos, all files). I created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were watching (you've got a good taste hahaha), and 2nd part shows the recording of your webcam. All your data is already uploaded to a remote server. Do not try to contact me. Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either since your data is already on a remote server. Exactly what should you do? Well, in my opinion, 500 (USD) Dollars is a fair price for our little secret. You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (search "Bitcoin Wallet" in Application Store then Download and Install it) Make a deposit to your wallet. After that, transfer it to my wallet. My Bitcoin (BTC) wallet address: 👉 1KxcLRkaN9hfx3dZWurCNKbKhYsHzxa7xR 👈 (It is case sensitive, Bitcoin wallet address Beginning with 1 and ending with R)." I am pretty sure it is a scam cause other individuals from other country got this message too. Not too sure whether others got this email too. But do take note. Not sure what i've lost (maybe personal info IDK) but i DEFINITELY will not send money to this person

Ordered two razor refills on 23rd nov 2019 due to replacement urgency. On 5th dec 2019, seller confirmed no stock to ship and thus order was cancelled. I was told refund will take no more than 14 working days. After more than 14 working days, no refund in sight. Followed up with seller several times, they give excuses that they have refund system problem but no date of payment committed. Eventually, i gave them an option to ship item (which should have stock by now in feb 2020) or refund, they simply ignore my messages and never reply since then. I researched online and found that there are many other victims cheated by this seller as well. Beware and don't ever buy from carethy.net.

09 feb 2020 Saw the advertisement on Facebook selling surgical masks and made a purchase of 10 boxes of masks for US$337. after that i became suspicious of the merchant and did a online search for the merchant. didn't locate the company but instead found several articles talking about it being a scam. Searched the domain page settings and noted that the page is only set up 4 days. now the FB page is disabled and my emails to the merchant are being rejected. I requested Standard chartered bank to stop the credit card payment but they refused.
I picked up a call from +65 9761 4353 What i heard was an automated call from 'DBS' saying that my account had noted some unusual activities. It was in both english and mandarin. It then said to press 3 to speak to someone. After a short while, a man (sounded young, 20s - 30s) picked up the phone and spoke in mandarin. He did not immediately pretend to be DBS, but asked me what's the matter. I spoke to him in English saying that i received a call that said my DBS account had some unusual activities. He apologized and said his was a chinese speaking center, and asked if i speak Chinese. I then basically (calmly, as an advice) told him not to do bad things and that there is karma. I could tell he got a little upset and told me 'you are the one that is a' (in chinese) 'scam' (in english, pronounced 'se-cam'). I didn't even use that word on him. Anyway I hung up after that, but wanted to report and share the phone number (as it was a scam number)

I reported the matter to DBS.
This guy, Brian Powell (51 years old) befriended me on TINDER asked me for my whatsapp number, almost immediately, I don't see his profile on Tinder anymore, claimed he's not comfortable there as there's women asking him for money. He claimed he's widowed for 5 years. Wife died in a car crash, he's originally from Philadelphia but migrated to Melbourne 10 years ago. He have a 15 year old son living with his aunt is the USA. He's a drilling consultant and needs to travel very often. He would text me daily, with sweet talks, claimed he's coming over to Singapore by end of Feb to visit me, but he needs to go to Doha to work on his new project before he comes over. The sweet talks happened daily for 3 weeks, I tried to do a voice call with him twice, somehow, he would evade the request. I sensed something was wrong. One day, he claimed he went shopping, he wanted to send the items to me before he comes over, he says he do not have enough space in his luggage and the items he bought are expensive, not safe to keep in the hotel. I asked for photos of the items, he sent some photos of jewellery and some other items, I told him those items are not what I liked and told him to return. He insisted to send the items over and asked me for my address, I refused to give. He disappeared after that.
My wife and I received calls from the same number. The man called obviously from a call centre. He said first he is from DBS, then changed his lingo that he represents all banks and wants to verify personal details, otherwise all bank accounts will be frozen. When I asked him for My name. He threatened me to block my accounts if I don't answer. I just hung up. Nothing's lost

https://www.medicallex.com/mask/ claims they sell masks and have ready stock and they are from USA Arizona. checking the company name in the arziona corporation commission for medical lex company name yields nothing. the address provided is a bogus one, which is actually a small shopping village. many have fall prey and ordered masks but never got delivered. do not buy from this website!
I met him on instagram. Within 3 days, he said he is interested in me, in pursuing marriage if it worked out. He claimed to be widower with a 4-yr-old girl, a Singaporean whose parents migrated to the states before he was born. Currently based in San Diego, but he intends to relocate here by the end of the year. About two weeks after we chatted, I bought him a sim card ($15; the first number indicated) so that he can use WhatsApp, claiming he is offshore (with Keppel) and can't get one. Two days later, he claimed he couldn't receive my messages and he started texted me using another number (the second number indicated). But there was still records of the other number being online. Then he asked me to get an iTunes card for him. All thanks to this website that I know he's a scammer. I said I might have cancer and he called me immediately. Very nice and smooth but his African accent was another giveaway. I used the sim card on my phone and found that he was using that number to WhatsApp someone else, who said that he even claimed to have a house at Yishun! Please be wary and vigilant when making friends online!

Met a guy tru instagram on 5th of feb 2020, said from uk and is an engineer, and was told story said almost did something crazy after broken with ex. everyday will drop simple msg, but on 8th of feb, suddenly said he went shopping for his mum, and tot abt me also bought me gift. at first i never think too much and thought just a normal postcard or souvenir, so just gave him address. thn the next day, he claim tat sent by EXPRESSES and told me i have to pay some fee when parcel arrive. he also said he put 45000 pound in the parcel cos he want to use it when he visit singapore. i was shock, in my mind, as a high educated engineer, why can he put money inside the parcel? he DOESN'T know that it will confiscated by custom. and NOWADAYS, the credit card is convenient to bring oversea, why must put the pounds in the parcel, was him crazy? and in the afternoon time, a guy with malaysia phone number text me said the things from london to me need clearance and i have to pay clearance fee at S$4200 as the things overweight at 35kg? S$4200 for clearance??? what is the thing inside and it weight more than 35kg? i asked the uk guy, he said is a surprise and asked me to settle with the delivery man immediately since there is 45k pound in the parcel, so i request the delivery man to send me the photo of the parcel, i want to see how huge is the parcel. but he refuse to send me and said he has no right to do it. and asked to do the only cash deposit to his dbs personal account. the 'uk' guy said the gift is worth more than 1k pound but i have to pay S$4200 clearance fee, and the gifts was stuck in malaysia custom. he said i can get back the money when i received the parcel. he keep calling me for several times, but i told him i was in meeting, and he asked again my address, search for me the nearby atm and asked me to bank in to the delivery guy immediately, i told him i was busy, will bank in later after work, but he keep calling, i refuse to answer and just text him said i was busy.. then i have blocked both of the delivery man number and this uk guy number immediately. 1) never believe people said they put money in the parcel 2) no matter how express, delivery from other countries at least 3 days 3) delivery company must have company bank account and company phone number and will always able to check the parcel 4) no allow bank transfer must be something wrong 5) parcel from uk to singapore but why have to do clearance in malaysia?
i met david from the academic singles dating site on 16 jan 2020. he told me that he is the boss of a construction company and that he is now doing a rig construction project in turkey. this project was due to complete in feb 2020 and he will be flying over to see me because he has fallen in love with me deeply and felt that i am the perfect person for him. I was very puzzled on the development of this relationship but nevertheless felt good to have sweet nothings everyday. on 24 jan, he told me that his worker has accidentally caused damage to a machinery control panel and the panel needed to be replace urgently. the cost of the control panel is USD 45k and there is an outstanding balance of USD 3k that he would like me to transfer the money over to him. he was even willing to pay me back double next week after his fund reached him. He even sent me the invoice that clearly shown the outstanding balance. Immediately, i can tell that the invoice is a fake one. i told david that i will not transfer the money to him and block him immediately. my loss in this case was my previous time and emotions. Also, i realized that there are dozens of scammers in the academic singles site. please avoid that site.

I RECEIVED A CALL today 11th february 2020 FROM a VIBER account (+923078558046). an indian accent guy tried to inform me regarding my dbs/posb account having an issue. As im already aware for this kind of scam, i directly cut the call immediately.
1) how it happened? Received a call in the morning from a lady with an indian accent, lots of background noise (sounded like a call centre). Claimed that she is from singtel and that they have detected some problems with my internet connection. throughout the call she asked me more than once if i was the main user and owner. she then asked me to check how many lights are lit up on my router and what kinds of devices are connected to my internet. she then transferred me to a man who introduced himself with a Caucasian name and started out speaking in an American accent. he asked me to look at my computer, tell him what key was next to the control key (to determine if i was using a Mac or PC), then made me access the command terminal. He then tried to tell me what to type in it (clearly to hack me). when i asked if i can do this some other time he started get a bit hostile and raised his voice (and his accent changed to an indian accent) asking me if i knew what this was for and that i said i knew what this was for earlier. i said yes i know but why can't i do this some other time? then he hung up. 2) When it happened 1057am 11/02/2020 3) nothing was lost
i was attracted to a message saying i could borrow 10k with a repayment for 60mths. so i was curious and texted the number to enquire. and very quickly someone by the name of TH responded and said in order to start the process, he will bank in 500 into my account and then in return, i was to transfer 800 to them in a couple of days, this is to set up the account and show some kind of track record. he asked for an a picture of my IC front and back . and a screenshot of my cpf contributions. a video call was then made to verify i am the person showing on the ic but their screen was blocked out so i couldnt see who i was dealing with . it didnt feel right and i looked up the registry of licensed moneylenders and found their name on the list. i was also convinced to borrow more, the amount would be 30k because my cpf showed that i was earning a significant amount. it was 550x 60mths, this was a loan that was as good as my renovation loan and it seemed really attractive. 3 days later, i received the call and i sent 800, they were about to process the loan and told me everything was ready and it was ready to be dispersed, i was then told to transfer 1680 as a transaction fee. that was when i knew it was a fake. i told them i didnt have the money and cannot transfer that amount and i didnt want to take the loan anymore, they said, not to worry and sent me an agreement letter. to show that everything was legitimate but the legal document once again did not look right and i told them, no, i did not want the loan. i was then threatened and was told i have to pay a cancelation fee of 20%, which did not make sense when i did not sign anything. he kept threatening and said once this is cancelled, it will be handled by a different department and he wouldn't know how they will handle this. i kept insisting that i did not want the loan and he said he will call me back. i have since blocked their number. and reported it to the police.Editor's Note: Some scammers will claim to be from a licensed moneylender to fool people into taking up loans with them. To be sure, pls call the official number shown in the Registry or visit the actual office to find out more. Note that licensed moneylenders are NOT allowed to advertise their service online, via messaging apps and SMS.

Same as other's sharing, met JERRY CHEUNG BOGDEN on CMB in late dec 2019, he said he grew by a foster dad in moscow, he's an architecture. was betrayed by his gf who have affairs with his best friend. so he stopped all the usage of social media. gave high attention to me. but he's called for indonesia all of a sudden coz a building he build was COLLAPSED. I stopped communicating with him coz i saw his name from one of the post here. thanks other sisters sharing. All girls pls keep away from this guy!!!!
I initially saw the advertisement on Facebook and was tempted by the price offered by the scammer. Out of curiosity, I visited their site and contacted the seller via whatsapp. He asked for an immediate bank transfer and promised a delivery within 90 minutes. Guided by greed and desire for the product, I transferred the money ($220) to him on the 3rd of February. However, i did not receive the product in the time frame promised. The scammer then forged an email using the name of fastfastdelivery and sent it to me, requesting for another $300 transfer for gst and insurance charges. I realised I was scammed. Using this platform, I would like to urge everyone to think twice before performing an online transaction. Some deals are too good to be true and hence, pls do your research before purchasing from an online seller.
Met john on Bumble mid Dec. He is a petroleum engineer, singaporean who lost parents moved to us. Moving back to sg to start his own oil company. Ex-girlfriend cheated on him, he focused on his career, now successful. We started chatting on Wechat on dec 20. He was awarded a 2 mil contract (showed me the contract) at istanbul, flew there, started working on a rig. Jan 14, cyber attack on the rig, moved conversation to hangout because of internet restriction. His machine broke, asked me to transfer money from his account to supplier to pay for repair. Bank sent him an alert of potential hacker, froze his account, he asked me to help pay for repair. I transferred money to a foreign account on jan 16. Similar things happened, i again helped him. On feb 4, he told me tax officers were on the rig to collect tax, threaten his life if he does not pay. I realized something is amiss, filed a police report. The man made me feel appreciated and loved, he sounded very convincing, understanding, and he volunteered information. I did basic research on the info he provided and they seem legit. Ladies, be careful out there. A guy who said the right thing may not be a real person. Never send money to strangers. Lesson learnt.
I got call from +6590234111 number . He said he is calling from DBS bank. he ask my dbs digi bank credentials
I got a call on my work phone from an Australian number. the caller claimed to be from Singtel and said my broadband was faulty. I thought it was a scam because they are calling from Australia.

I received a cold call from a "henry jordan", a man with an indian accent. He claimed to be a singtel representative. He told me that i have a security problem with my internet connection and wanted me to do something to check my router. When i told him that i did not have an internet subscription with singtel, he said that singtel is the ultimate provider for all other internet service providers. I asked him which connection of mine he was referring to, and he said it was my home connection. When i asked him what was my home address, he was not able to provide any address to me. I then got suspicious and asked him for his full name and employee number. He said "henry jordan" and that his "page number" (not very audible) was "stls 15891". I then told him that i had to check the authenticity of his call with singtel first and he immediately hung up.
Indian lady called on 6 Feb morning and said she’s calling on behalf of Singtel. Feedback that our home router was compromised by people with Foreign IP Addresses and she can help to provide assistance to block them. said she wants to do a survEy, la=ter became technical assistance. Asked me to check my router if it had blinking lights. If it is, thEn security is compromised. Then she asked me to Turn on my Laptop so she can show me the steps to get rid of these forEign Ip adds. Then, i purposely hung up thE phone. She called back (different locla number - all starts with +65) When i asked for her id, she identified herself as “amy smith”. No offence but this is not a Usual name for an indian Lady with strong Accent. She was insistent and blabbered on when i told her i will verify thiS service with singtel Before i hung up. When i called back on both numbers, Both are invalid. Pls take note of the following red flags:-1) singapore number +65. However, First number is not a mobile or home/business number. It doesN’t start with 8//9 or 6. Mine Was shown as +6536121491. The other one was TRickier. +6561106609. They probably used some software to generate the numbers.2) Router lights blinking so Security is compromised. Fact is: 1 light Will blink to show that it’s working.3) i’m a starhub subscriber, why would a singtel staff call me? When questioned, she said singtel is doing this for free as all the telcos are under their umbrellaHope these info helps

Scammer called me and said they were from Singtel, wanted to know how many people use the "internet line". upon giving them a fake number, they told me that more people were using the line and wanted to fix it for me. then they transferred the call to a "senior technician", who was using a voice spoofing (know this as it failed abruptly mid-call) software. The man then told me to download teamviewer. i stopped the call then. (knew all along, just wanted to see where this was going)
I received phone call from 94256073 around 15:30. A lady claimed to be from SINGtel, saying i have internet issue, and blah blah. Since the voice quality was not good and the call was from a mobile number, I hang the call and contacted singtel customer service. around 18:20, another number called in, 97374929. i felt it was the same lady. she also claimed to be from singtel and I have internet issue. I asked her then to drop me an email, and she hang the call. no lost, but i feel it is important to share the encounter with everyone.

I met the scammer while browsing through wechat. I didn't suspect her to be a scammer. Was talking to her normally, until she mention her services as part-time job for cover study. She was being persistent that i should visit her when i was free during the weekend. As soon as the weekend hits, i was supposed to go somewhere else for personal stuff but she was being persistent that i find her during the weekend. So when i went to the location which was at blk 512 bishan . She told she needed my number's so the manager can call me. When the manager call, he asked me to pay using alipay credits through the axs machine by type the qq mail and choose the amount they told me to pay. I obliged. I didn't know something was wrong until i transfer a total of $3300. They even told me borrow from friends when i not enough to pay the amount. I just ignored the calls from them. They started to spam call and message stating that they will hunt me down and mess with my family and work. While the girl was trying to convince me why i should pay up as it part of their "protection" which is stupid as to why it was not mention at all. Note to guys out there, never trust any girls who you never meet before in your life.
Someone named Zhu Lan contacted me on gumtree, appears to be from overseas. In the initial email, the person send me 'her' ic photo which at first seems like a sincere person looking for a room. However, sometimes seems off as she kind of agree to everything very quickly and okay with the room without even coming down to view it personally. The person even offered to pay the rent of the first 3 months, as 'she' need to show the employer the proof of rent before she can quit her current oversea job as a cruise chef.I notice something was off when she asked me to register for a paypal account, its the way the email was structured like it was meant to send as a mass phishing email scam. The next thing was the whatsapp number 'she' provide was a +63 philippines number.Afterward i did a search on her name, it indeed was a scam as other fellow singaporean already encountered this same person few months ago.I only lost my paypal email , name and phone number information. I just hope to bring awareness to other people renting room to be careful of this particular scam. She offered pay 3 months in advance by paypal, but before paying, she will ask you to pay for her mover fee which is around $500 that she will include in the rental fee afterwards. If someone approaches you to give you months' of rental in advance, be wary!

I received 2 calls recently about os update from windows 7 to windows 10. Both calls received between 8-9pm, One was on saturday night. Both callers said they were from microsoft and were here to help update os or solve my laptop/ pc problem. Call reception also not good ( a lot of distortion) eventhough it displayed local numbers. This made me suspicious, as i have never heard microsoft providing such services. Furthermore on saturday night and with poor reception.

i received a call from a hidden number ON CHINESE NEW YEAR EVE 2020. usually i don't pick up calls FROM UNKNOWN NUMBERS but since i was waiting for a delivery, i picked it up. there was no one on the other end for almost one minute but i heard voices in the background and some static. after 1 minute, someone said "hello, I am from the technical department of singtel". he then went on to say the usual dialogue i've seen in other people's reports here, SUCH AS "we have received warnings from your ip address, some people are using it to access internet. when you log in to facebook, banks etc they can see your details." tbh, from the moment he said "singtel" I knew it was a scam because singtel usually contacts my husband, not me, because i deflect whatever service that requires phone calls to my husband (#introvertproblems) but i decided to play along. i asked him "where are you from?" and again he repeated "FROM THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT OF SINGTEL". then I repeated again, "where are *you* from?" (because he also sounded foreign and it was hard to understand his accent) and again he repeated "fROM THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT OF SINGTEL, for three years in singapore". then i said "do you have any verification?" and he said "yes, you take pen and paper and write down this number and you can verify and you know we are from THE TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT OF SINGTEL". to which i replied "and where am I supposed to check this number against??" THEY ASKED ME TO REPEAT MYSELF AGAIN AND TO SPEAK LOUDER (I SEE THEY'RE PLAYING MY GAME TOO HUH) AND THEN I JUST SAID "NO I WILL NOT SPEAK LOUDER AND I WILL NOT REPEAT MYSELF I AM BUSY NOW OK BYE BYE." WHILE ON THE PHONE I WAS ALSO ON WEB WHATSAPP AND MESSAGING MY HUSBAND TO CHECK WITH HIM, WHICH WAS WHY I DECIDED TO PLAY ALONG WITH THE SCAMMER'S PHONE CONVERSATION. MY HUSBAND WHO IS FROM THE IT DEPARTMENT OF HIS COMPANY ALSO SAID, IF THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH WHATEVER SERVICE, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT WILL BE THE ONE TO CALL YOU -- NEVER IT/TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT! HOPE THIS STORY HELPS SOMEONE! Editor's Note: Pls end a call if you find it suspicious and call the company's official number to verify the identity of the caller. The Singtel tech support impersonation scam is an ongoing scam, hence, pls beware of this scam.

The following are my transactions: I have paid: 1) $1000 ( UOB 3633052466) on 5 Jan 2029 ($700 +$300) $700 was transfer to my account and I had to return $1k After (1) transaction, they said not accepted as I put the wrong remarks and forces me to transact again. I had no choice as I was working and the constant call they ring me dozen times...I was promised once done, there will be no more fees. I was instructed to put "CLEAR DANNIS" 2) $1000 ( UOB 3633052466) on 5 Jan 2029 (clear Dannis) Then I was harnessed to pay $1500 Admin fee upfront. As I had exceeded the limit to transfer for that day , they said that he can accept $1000. 3) $1000 (UOB 455 394 8872) on 5 Jan 2020 -()Admin Fee) After the (3) transaction had been done, he claim their accounts do not accept and then asked me to transfer $1500 and they will refund me when the loan is given out.

I am given two days until 8 Jan to clear this $1500. I am.always careful but because I did contact the licensed lender and the confidence, I lost my bearings and fall into trap.

Received a Whatsapp message regarding loan tenures at a lower interest rate on the 29th dec 2019. My husband was showed interest for 50k loan and at this point we didn't suspect anything fishy. Since my husband is self employed, he(jonathan) needed my pay slip and also my ic details. We sent him. Being a sunday, the loan was cleared within 1 hr at about 9pm. Jonathan claimed that he was working overtime and that is how he was able to get our loan approved so fast. He was even willing to meet us up immediately to get the so call documents signed but before that he wanted to confirm our bank account whether it belongs to us and immediately transferred us $500 which came from sender alan. Then he wanted us to transfer him $1k which will be refunded back upon signing the documents. So i transferred him $1k with the recipient name alan and sender as my name to given ocbc account number. Jonathan watsapp call to said that we put the wrong name and wanted us to transfer another $1k with the correct name. At this point we knew something was not right and we questioned him. Jonathan asked the admin guy ( ivan) to contact us. Ivan was asking us to transfer 1k or we will have to pay a cancellation fee (10%) of the amount to be borrowed. This was not even mentioned to us in the begining. We knew this was a scam and made a police report on the same night itself. We lost a total of $500. Pls pls never ever respond to and text or watsapp messages regarding loans. These people are scammers. They cant even speak proper english and onlu uses watsapp message and calls to communicate with you.

27th Dec. Got a call from the number as stated. Automated voice claiming to be airport customs asked me to press 3 for more details on "important documents". I pressed 3 out of curiosity. Directed me to a chinese guy, who said something in chinese. I answered in English because this is SG. HE EXPLAINED IN ENGLISH (WITH AN ODD CHINESE/EASTERN ACCENT) THAT THAT WAS THE CHINESE DEPARTMENT. When I claimed not to speak chinese (I'm lying) , he just hung up. There's no way a sg airport customs would have someone who can't speak english.
Automated voice call from 83751602 impersonating DBS, I was asked to press 3 to continue, but I hung up the phone.
I got to know Jerry Cheung via coffee meets bagel app and chatted with him daily for 3 weeks. Jerry introduced himself as a singaporean raised in moscow as he was adopted by a russian at a young age. He said he has been living in Singapore for 8 months and he is waiting for licence approval to set up his company in singapore. He introduced his occupation as an architect.Jerry will shower you with lots of attention and professes his love, saying that he feels strongly connected to you even before he met you. You will think that everything sounds normal as Jerry shares his daily photos with you (e. G. Gym, food), updating you of his whereabouts etc. He also set a time to meet though not immediate as he said he had to return to moscow for work one week into the chat. Two weeks after chatting, one day, he said he had to rush to Indonesia as one of the building he erected collapsed. During investigation, his passport was seized by his client and he was hit by his client, injured and had to go to the hospital.I was half believing when i heard the story, but thank god my friend told me about this site and i found a few reports here with exact/almost similar plot. I blocked him on line since then even before he could ask me for money. To all the girls out there, please be aware of this person who might use the same story line to con others.
Wanted to rent my rooms which posted on Singapore room for rent website. She emailed me and told me she was currently working in Hongkong and coming back to Singapore. She told me she needed to pay her delivery company but she was posted to work overseas, unable to make the PAYMENT ANd SHe had lose her hand phone. She begged me to help her to pay the delivery company if not will incur more costs to move out from her house in Hongkong. She claimed that she had paid me via PayPal for the rent deposit and fee to transfer to the delivery COMPANY. I checked many times but didn't see the amount. I sensed that it was strange and rejected to transfer the money. I think the person has been using another person I/c to carry out the scam. So, if your receive a photo of an I/C, don't trust blindly as scammers can use details of others to cheat.
Know him from Facebook and later chat via line. We fell IN love after chatting 2 WEEKS. He asked me to join him FOR some investment and I trusted HIM and transferred usd to hongkong.

Till I knew something not right and decided to end everything. He blocked me FROM LINe after ALL things happened. Ladies out there, beware of guy u never meet and not to trust THEM too much.

I just received a call from 9217 4486 on 26 dec 2019 at 12.45pm from DHL, asked me to press 3 for more info. The lady officer asked my name and said i had a package detained at China CustomsI told her i didn't send any parcel.

I was re-directed to an officer telling me that I had a package detained at the Chinese customs, containing illegal items-1 jacket, 6 credit cards. I denied any connection to the parcel He then proceeds to tell me he would transfer my call to local police at Shanghai so that I can make a police report. The second person I spoke to transfer the call again to another police office because it was a foreign case. A third person, then told me to google his phone number to verify that he was indeed a Chinese police officer. I check the number. It turned up in Google search results as the number to the Shanghai Feng Xian district police station. This convinced me the call was authentic. He then sent over a picture of a police warrant card, which made me believe even more that the case was real and I started to feel scared. The person requested my Chinese identity card no and home address and to record a statement in private. The recording of the statement took place over Whatsapp. The person revealed on the call that I was further implicated in a more serious case that was confidential and I could not let anyone else know. The person told me a man called Mr Lu Jian was suing me for fraud and money laundering, and that my arrest warrant will to be issued and be detained for 45 days and assets frozen immediately. I was scared. The person asked if I would cooperate with them or be arrested by international police. I agreed to work with them out of shock. They monitored me every movement, to message them every 3 hours and not to not to tell the details to my family and other person to keep confidentiality. I had to inform them and no matter what time of the day it was, someone would always reply. They then asked me for all my bank account details so that they can check if I am involved the money laundering. Editor's note: Never entertain such calls and simply hang up these "DHL" phone calls

Scammer creates profiles on tinder, line &amp; facebook . Pretends to be interested in you and so on and so forth and is based in Hong Kong but comes from China. SHAREs photos of themselves as well as a good background story. (Very convincing) Pretends to help you by giving you inside information on investments via cryptocurrency and is willing to walk you through it. (Red flag but I carried on with it to learn more about the scam) Showed me a white paper document on a very recent cryptocurrency. (Very important is that you read the document and Google the information as well as the team leading it.) I use various platforms for research AND got in CONTACT with FRIENDS from the BANKING industry as well as intel from a cryptocurrency trader. Conclusion is that it might be a scam using the pump &amp; dump method. All the team members featured in the white paper do not exist after using facial recognition search and industry background search. Certain information written seemed off when reviewed by CRYPTOCURRENCY veterans. Scammer instructed me to use Huobi app to exchange fiat currency to USDT. After that using the USDT to deposit into Ruibtc trading site. I did An internet trustworthiness check on both and came up with not much issues. Huobi is valid and security seems good with a large amount of traders using it. Ruibtc was a bit suspicious so I did a test and transacted a small amount between both platforms TO test the legitimacy of it. Ruibtc passed as well. That only meant the CRYPTOCURRENCY was the problem. By encouraging investors to buy in and push value up and once that happens the scammers in control of the CRYPTOCURRENCY would dump/sell all of their units making the later investors lose their investments. I did additional searches on Facebook and tinder and found the same person with a different name. All posts were recently made. This is one of the most elaborate scams I have come across. (DHL, SPF, singpost are ALL 3rd rate scams) Halfway through she caught on to what I was doing but still pretended to be innocent. (I doctored a few of the screenshots and the scammer NOTICED the numbers did not tally lol) Now the question is, are those photographs of childhood and events a stolen identity or are they confident enough to use their own profiles to scam knowing that the government would not be able to track them down? I have further DOCUMENTATIONs if needed. Always remember do not run from scams, TRY if possible to find out as much information as possible without revealing much of your own. Come up with your own back story. If we don't learn how they operate we will always be outdated. Oh I did lose $70+ due to transactional fees and exchange rates BUT the case study was fascinating. THANK you.

I went through credit max loan, an actual LICENSED MONEY LENDER IN SINGAPORE. tURNs out that while they do have an office, their website is not theirs and its being run by a 3rd party guy called lester. He refused to send me documents claiming that the company on uses whatsapp for faster communication. He asked that I send him $1000. I felt something was wrong so i told him i am no longer INTERESTED. I called credit max to look for him only to be tol by the lady that "Lester" is a scammer and i need to call the police right away. Lesson learned, only trust banks for loans. not anyone else. Banks are there for a reason. Editor's note: Licensed money lenders are not allowed to advertise their services on social media, through messaging apps (including SMS). Contact licensed money lenders from this link: https://rom.mlaw.gov.sg/information-for-borrowers/list-of-licensed-moneylenders-in-singapore/
I met the scammer while browsing through tinder. I didn't suspect her to be a scammer. Was talking to her normally, until she mention her services.after i mention where i stay. she was being persistent that i should visit her when i was free during the weekend. As soon as the weekend hits, i was supposed to go somewhere else for personal stuff but she was being PERSISTENT that i find her during the weekend. So when i went to the location which was at blk 532 ang mo kio. she told she needed my number so the manager can call me. when the manager call, he asked me to pay using alipay credit. i obliged. i DIDN'T know something was wrong until i transfer a total of $2700. after i fed up that the person WASN'T showing up,. i just IGNORED the calls from them. they started to spam call and message stating that they will hunt me down and mess with my family. while the girl was trying to convince me why i should pay up as it part of their "Quota" which is stupid as to why it was not mention at all. So if you got numbers that are from +852 and +34, they are most likely not in Singapore. Note to guys out there, never trust any girls who you never meet before in your life.

I was shocked to hear because i did not call for singtel and furthermore, i do not subscribe singtel or my home internet. i asked her what has gone wrong with my home internet but she kept quiet and hung up the phone. I have blocked this number on my mobile but managed to screenshot the call info. the call was also recorded in my phone. nothing lost and no personal data was shared.
i was dm-ed by anthony lee on instagram (@anthony_lee768). he was very friendly, a sweet talker. he asks to move the conversation to whatsapp. he told me he loved me two weeks in. we continued daily conversation for 3 weeks. he tells me he lives in ottawa canada and works for go drilling inc. a few days later, he tells me, he has been promoted and will need to move to peru for 3 months to oversee a mine set up there. he then tells me he has gone to the mall and has bought he a surprise present. he ask for my mailing address (which i stupidly provided). he tells me the package is on the way and he will be on his way to peru. one day, very thankfully, a follower of his, contacts me on dm on instagram and tells me that he is a sweet talker, con man, scammer artist. She reveals to me that he had conned her of thousands of dollars. how it happens? the package that is on its way, will be stuck at customs. in order to have that package released, a fee of over 5000usd will have to be paid. the same day, anthony tells me that he receives a notification that the parcel should arrive at my mailing address. he asks if i received a notification. i request for more information, a tracking number or for him to forward the notification he has to my email. he refuses, insisting that he merely handed the parcel to a courier agent. he tells me to check. i tell him that things get lost in the post all the time and i have yet to receive anything. in the meantime, the girl that has so gratefully highlighted him as a scammer to me tells me the details of how she got conned. he will tell her to handle the customs, pay what the customs needs to release the package. when asked what was inside the parcel, he says that its a hermes bag worth thousands of dollars. long story short, this girl paid the initial fee of 5000usd to a personal bank account of another name. after that, she is told that more money is needed as it was found that there are additional taxes to be paid. ]
called me and told me that i sent a box of cloth to shanghai and there were bank cards and 28 passports she asked me to contact the shanghai police department to make a report about the package so that i would not get into trouble.
Met him in TanTan. Then we keep in contact via whatsapp. He is very fast in saying he loves me.He never asked things about me and dont shared much about himself except that he is divorced with no kids, his ex-wife cheated on him, his relatives all died, his father is singaporean and mother is us citizen. That is why he landed in us. He said he is 43 (1976), aries, graduated with degree in civil engineering (2nd upper class) and master with business finance. He also does alot of investment in forex trading. And he invested &gt;85% of his money in estates and forex trading so he has more money to migrate back and be with me. He does not know how to speak chinese yet his english and grammar is average level. He asked for my email address saying he wants me to read his document but i rejected. I asked him for video call and he did only once and it is very fake. After that he never do it again even i asked him many times. Always said he is very busy.Last straw is he said he won a contract with keppel shipyard and technology centre. Showing me 2 pics of the contract cert and award session. So far we exchanged pics of each other, that is, his will be all fakes then.. Will block him after this.
I received a WhatsApp message with attractive loan package. 5k for 20months @ $275. I send them my IC and payslip loan approved in few hours but there is a clause they will need to pay a loan tax of $200. They transfer $500 3 days later transfer back $500 + $200. I believe in them. 3 days down the road I find in very suspicious. Call the mobile no. "Not in used" ask them for office number they mention all contact by WhatsApp. I have transferred back the amount of $500. Now they keep messaging asking for the interest of $200 changing their statement to test loan and scold vulgarities and all types of threaten warning.

- I received a call from the number +65 6109 3318, where a supposedly Singtel Technician, with a heavy indian accent, claim that there's an issue with my Singtel Internet Broadband. - When I asked what is the issue and what can i help him with, his first question was to ask if I was home, and subsequently if i could switch on my computer so that he could show me what exactly is the problem. - I asked him again what exactly is the issue, and whether he could explain to me what is happening and he says that there are intruders accessing my home internet and he needs me to switch on my computer so as to help him to solve the issue. - At this point, i know that it is probably a scam, i pretended i've switch on the computer and asked what is next. The 'technician' required me to open the 'command prompt' within my Windows OS. - He then proceeded to say that he has to now "transfer" the call to his colleague to assist me further on what i need to do - I hanged up the phone at this juncture. - However, i believe they will either 1) ask me to provide them with my IP address so that they could remotely access my terminal or 2) they are likely getting me to connect to their server some way and some how.

I also recently almost a victim of this scam. Someone called me from yesterday that I won $50k from Duty Free Changi Airport draw. In order to transfer the money to my account, I need to show it to them my card details via video call. I showed it to them then told me to wait for the otp which was sent to me. I realized that they are making online purchase which unable to go through coz the card details i gave to them is actually no fund. action taken: 1) called police hotline &amp; confirmed that this is actually a scam. 2) called bank hotline &amp; terminated the card immediately. Lesson learned: SCAMMERS are really smart but we should be SMARTER than them. i attached the contact number and possible information. hope this will help and warn other people not to give card details and beware of their sweet talks.

I had just received a call from this mobile 94069955, a guy on the line claimed he is from SingTel and said they have received alert that my internet connection is running on insecure network. It is strange, caller said I have to sit in front of my laptop before he would guide me through. I asked how do I know if he is from Singtel but he said he would provide an IS number. I said I would verify with Sing Tel and hung up the phone. At about the same time I got a call from +49471768296; seem to be a Germany number. I had not picked up the call though
The usual automated voice, first in english saying that it is a call from DHL and if you have a parcel, please press "3". followed by the mandarin instructions. i pressed "3". a guy spoke in mandarin. i started asking who is this and what is it. he kept asking me to speak in mandarin. i said i'm indian and i don't know how to speak chinese. he hung up immediately. when i tried calling back the number, it is not available.
Caller had an automated system stating i had an unclaimed parcel with DHL, they asked if i wanted to be put through to DHL. The person on the other end of the line only spoke in Mandarin and then hung up. Spoke with DHL afterwards by calling them and they noted likely a scam. the number is invalid if you try to call back. So, please do not divulge your info over to strangers over the phone just like that!
Beware of this number 9434 8440 - it makes a call to your mobile and speaks in a robotic mandarin voice, saying that your phone will be terminated in 2 hours. It asked me to press 5 so that I can deal with the issue. I didn't proceed to press 5 (even though I really wanted to scold the people on the other side of the line). Everyone, please beware! Children, share this scam with your parents or grandparents or seniors to warn them of this scam.
Automated call on the other end posing as DBS bank. called to say that account has been compromised and to click "3" on the phone dial to proceed. hung up immediately.
On 5 dec, we received several harassment calls from a cody who claimed to be a loanshark AND that my helper had borrowed money from. After showing us her workpermit and the conversation she had with the UML, it was clear that there was no transaction made when my helper had decided to forgo the borrowing but they demanded a 'cancellation FEE' of $200 which we refused to give. This was despite the fact that no acct number were given to the other PARTY hence they could not transfer anything but our personal number and address was compromised. Despite Police report were MADE, They have been harassing us via whatsapp ever SINCE. I urge everyone not to accept any sweet deals from WHATSAPP loan scam and do not release any personal particulars to channels of unknown.

After everything was done, he asked me pay for the accountant money (2 pax) to make the transaction smooth. at this point of time, i told the person I did not have enough money to pay and he insisted me to pay. at this point, i gave up and went HOME and realised i was scammed and did my research online. btw, i borrowed Nearly 1k from my friend to do the transaction. i regretted my action and Now I HAVE to find ways to pay back my friends the money i borrowed. hope you guys can see this story and prevent yourself from any form of scam by scammers!

(no, the one who called me wasn't a man, i believe is her herself, with taiwanese accent) i suspected it was a scam when she told me to purchase rmb500 alipay credit. the reason she came out with is she is a student and offering sex as part time job, paying with money would get catch easily. i hang up the call and did research on the spot about alipay scamming and found out a lot of men encountered the same experience, even the pricing and technique are exactly the same. i only spent $16 for taking grab to her location in the whole incident.

a gentleman with a strong indian accent calls pretending being from singtel and advising my line is faulty. was trying to make me connect to my computer and give hom contro over it. 2 phone numbers used: 6523 1526 64911124

Then i blocked the number. i do not know why they would deactivate my number when I have been using it everyday and haven't been overseas in the last 3 months. This is a scam, so beware!
I received a call from a local number and the person on the other line said he was from Singtel. he claimed that my internet was unsecure and experiencing a lot of errors, which was not likely as i am fairly tech savvy and was not experiencing any issues with our home internet. i hung up once the person started to elaborate on the procedures. the individual on the other line sounded fairly local and did not have a particular foreign accent, unlike other impersonation calls I experienced experienced in the past.
I was first called up by a chinese speaking man claiming to be from IMDA with a singapore number. He stated that my phone line will be cut off within the next 2 hours because someone created another number with singtel using my particulars. I was told to contact the chinese investigative bureau, a chinese number, and clarify with them so that my line will not be cut. When i called the chinese investigative bureau, they said that a 57 yo man was swindling money by creating fake accounts under my name and phone number in china, and to be sure that i was no relation to the man, they required me to answer questions while the call was recorded. It made the whole situation seem very real because the fake officer was calling other investigative authorities to bring up my case files, etc. i had to declare with my name, and nric. They asked me personal information on my family and living circumstances. The call ended saying they will continue the investigation and contact me through watsapp, plus i was to update them my location at 5pm and 8pm. I was also not to divulge any of information of the case to anyone or they would be implicated into the investigation. the next day, the fake officer called me again saying they had new evidences of my involvement in the case, they even sent me a certificate of the bank accounts created in hong kong, with my chinese name and nric stated. In order to clear my name of any involvement, i was to either fly to hong kong, paying for my own air ticket, and meet with the officers there, or to transfer money to them and freeze my accounts. Thats when i realised that i was a part of a scam because no official would waste 4 hours of talking to you over the phone and subsequently asking you to transfer money or asking for personal bank details. I hung up saying that i would not transfer any money or reveal my bank accounts. Subsequently, i called the singapore police hotline to make a report.
On the 3rd december 2019, Tuesday morning at about 11am. There is a hacker that tries to hack into my internet router this morning by impersonating as a Singtel technical representative. He asked me if i am the owner and if i am at home. he even told me that there is tehcnical problem that their end cannot solve and the owner(myself) needs to solve it. He asked me to use my own laptop to access the router by pressing the "windows key" button and follow by "R" and kept saying that the owner needs to solve the internet issues on his side, and their technical side is facing problem. I kept asking him about my particulars since Singtel trading representative will know my particulars. He could not give me my details and I immediately know that it is a scam. I put down the phone and quickly called Singtel hotline 1688 to find out that it is a scam. INDEED IT IS A SCAM. because singtel technical representative will never call unless there is request by the user for callbacks. I I have also informed the police at 1800 225-0000 of such case. luckily , i did not give any personal details to this person.

Received a scam call todya. Caller sounded like an indian lady and claiming that she is calling from singtel. She is calling to jnform me that singtel has observed that in the past few days, there was an exceptionally high volume of internet traffic by unauthorised users from my home internet . They suspected that my wifi router has been compromised and instructed to reset the router.. Caller abruptly terminated the call when i tried to verify her identity further.Sharing this incident so that others do not fall victims such scam.
I received a call on 2 dec 2019 at 10.38am. This guy claimed he is from singtel technical department. He claimed that my internet line was hooked up by many illegal users and wanted me to on my computer n he will show me. at first i thought it's might be true as I just fixed up my new recontract router one day before. Then I realised that my ISP is not Singtel and the caller ID showed his number as handphone which is unusual for a customer service officer. I quickly cut my line and call singtel to verify. Singtel said probably a scam. By the way, the scammer sound like an indian. I call police hotline and he refer me to scam alert phone number.
I met this man through a dating app and he was very kind and sweet at first. He said he was based in an offshore island in Malaysia and was relocating to Singapore. After a month of texting and phone conversations (he said he was unable to do video calls because his phone could not support it in the offshore island), he called me one day sounding ANXIOUS- the day that he was supposed to come to Singapore. He said that the officers had increase his income tax and he had to pay 9000 ringgit. He asked me if I could help him to transfer USD$2000. He said once he comes to Singapore, he will return the money. Feeling bad and also, hoping to see him, I foolishly sent SGD$1000 (I could not afford more than that). But he did not come that day as he claimed that the process to clear his taxes took long. He said that he will come to Singapore the next day instead. Again, he called and this time said he needed money to pay for the chopper (mode of transportation from the offshore island to KL) and to transport his machines too. This time, i was a bit more wary and said I could not afford it. We still continued chatting and I started asking him for EVIDENCEs/proof. He became very defensive and angry that I did not trust him. I said if he wanted me to lend him money to provide proof but until the hand, he sounded very defensive and rude. He also sent a fake us passport profile once but I was able to see through the scam now after being so stupid. I blocked him from then. I did ask him to return my money but I have yet to receive. I hope this incident will cause one to be wary- to please not blindly trust those online who are sweet and kind. I found his images on another dating site with another name.
I met this guy who calls himself jin on Instagram. He said he is a Singaporean working and living in USA. WithIn 1 week, he professed his love and admiration. We could get along really well and he was very sweet, UNDERSTANDing and encouraging. We exchanged many photos and he knows about my 2 children. He claims to have one child who is 4 years old and is divorced. As I am going through a divorce myself, it was a match. We chatted every day for close to 2 months. He said he is coming back to Singapore to see me and we will plan a life together. He said his boss needs him to go to belgium for work before he can come back to SG.he is suppose to buy some machinery. On the 6th day of being in belgium, he was going to buy the machine but left his company card at home in USA. Then he realised he cannot use his personal card. Neither can he wire money over to the seller via internet banking . He couldn't ask others or his boss because he didnt want to look incompetent. So he asked for my help - by logging in to his account from Sg and transfer the money to my bank account before transferring it to belgium. Somehow the transfer didnt go through to me. All this while my red flags were up. I did a check on his bank and it seems fake. I also did a photo reverse check on him. I found that he has stolen someone Else's profile and pictures. He is not who he said he was. I blocked him on Instagram and deleted our chat on Google hangout after confronting him. He has since shut down his IG account.
I knew this guy thru MEETUP, he named himself as jason choo lan, in early august 2019 we connected (whom's message in my mail box since April 2019). in the meetup group he told me that he is interested to find out more of singapore cultural as he will soon need to work in kepple shipyard as an ENGINEER of installation/maintenance of crude oil storage tanks. after 1 and a half months of daily chatting we become close friend and chat that concern about work and my family as well his personal life and mine. he also PURSUE me to divorce as he aware i was struggle in a no love MARRIAGE. in mid sep 2019 he told me that he has a shipment from china as he cant order the steels &amp; MATERIALS for oil tank ship from USA because of the China and USA trade war, he REQUESTED me to help him TRACKING the status of his shipments arrival, but ended he requested me to support his dock tax payment....hence, i help him out to transfer the amount needed to his agent- Lee louisa wee lee who he claims handle his project at kepple shipyard....... then after the whole transaction he said he fly to sg to work but never appear nor delivery his PROMISE to payback the sum he loan from me.

Posted on a few sites regarding room to let. A lady called "yeo siew lian" emailed and asked about availability of room. I kena such email before and went to check on scam alert. True enough, there is another post on this person. Decided to delete away the email.
Received a call claiming to be from singtel and informed that there are problems with my home internet connection. he claimed that overseas people are accessing my internet. subsequently, he transferred the call to another "security" department of singtel and asked me to run command prompt on my pc to ASSOCIATE the connection to their server. he sounded professional and guided me through. however, it was very inconsistent. then i revealed that i am reporting to the police and he hung up.
Met this attractive lady on wechat nearby search and ask me to chat on line instead. offered sex for S$100 for 2 hrs. curious, meet up at simei Eastpoint/MRT as advised by her. she then asked me to take a picture of the nearby macdonald and told me that her boss will contact me after giving her my mobile number. Shortly, a man called without any caller ID. spoke in mandarin and ask me for security reason and 1st time client, to purchase something at AXS machine. then i REALISED he wants me to purchase alipay credit at Rmb500. He also wants me to enter their email address for the purchase which made me suspicious. this is because the password will be sent to the email address to claim the credit purchase. I noticed something was amiss when they want to make me pay/credit in advance. I also noticed there is a big police signboard near the axs machine warning public about the recent scam. for me, i am lucky that no money is lost in this process...i have uploaded a copy of the axs receipt which the lady has sent me. she insisted that she just need the receipt once payment is made at the axs. i believe this person is cheated when payment is made to the scammer.
Received a call (+65 60090799) approx @4:32pm, i picked up the call , an automated voice of a lady speaking in English was mentIoning something.

He claimed the phone camera and the network does not work which was why he couldn't do any facetime or video call. Be careful to deal with this type of People.
The call has a message saying my Mobile phone line will be terminated unless I called them back.
Case happened on 26 november 2019, about 2.40pm Caller claimed to be calling from singtel with a noisy background. He claims singtel is the main provider of internet in Singapore and the likes of m1 and starhub etc needs to subscribe from singtel. and said he would like to make a change for me. i questioned him singtel is just an isp in singapore, how is it possible to switch isp as he claimed and he hung up.
Just received sms today, asking me to do the payment for my overdue telecom Bill at $508.80. Seemed like a new scam variant! Don't fall for it and confirm your bill via your phone app or official account.

Answered a call, claimed to be dhl, an automated voice in monotonous english saying i have unclaimed package.It then proceeds to mandarin.A Similar call was Received earlier this year , stating the same BS. My call was forwarded to their “customer service officers” who speaks in a pinoy accent. She then mentioned that my package cOntained illegal goods and i have to pay $50 000. She also questioned me what Was the item i sent. It all doesn't tally because: 1. I thought I was receiving items? 2.She said i had illegal items, 3. She should know what the items are then since she is in the courier dept . She then trIed to speak to me like some federal agent, but i was confused for a moment since she was a customer service officer who seemed to be interrogating me at that moment. I did give her my particulars until she placed me on hold for the longest time that i realised i was being scammed. Anyone who encountered the same situation, pls ignore the call, block the number (if any) and share it with your friends and family members to alert them. Don't give in to their threats as it's part of their script to scare you into giving them money or personal information.
Received a call from a local number. answered it as i applied for some part time jobs i thought it was the company calling me baCK. They identified themselves as singapore telecom company which i thought was another name for singtel. however i was not a singtel user so i was suspicious. it was like those voice answering machine voice. they mentioned that my phone number is going to be DISCONTINUED. i immediately ended the call and called my service provider customer service to verify if my number is indeed gonna be DISCONTINUED. turns out to be a scam. thankful nothing was lost and i did not give any INFORMATION.
Don't be fooled by Credit-for-sex scams! Things to take note: 1. Usually scammer uses really really attractive/pretty girls photo on ads 2. Their rates are Reasonable in ‘market rate’, maybe $100/hr, $200/2 hr/unlimited etc 3. TheY usually leave with ContaCt and wechat/line details 4. They are very friendly with you, which Real sex worker wont 5. Their will ask You to go to a certain hdb block without unit number 6. And confirm plus chop, there will be 7 eleven at the block or Next to it 7. They will kept asking for your contact number 8. They will either ask you buy Apple credit, or do a traNsfer with axs to their account. 9. Once you transfer first Time, she will ask for more, for whatever reason you might believe. Else someone else will call you and threaThen you to kill you, haunt u down etc 10. Never believe as long they mention about no money transaction. 11. Never believe them when they are already Messaging you on messenger app, and still need your phone number.
This wasn't the first time I received such calls! A guy called me up first from 'Starhub' and then a week or so later from 'Singtel'. He claims that my BROADBAND has unusual activity and someone else has HIJACKED my home INTERNET. He then asks me to go to my computer and start logging into a website. A which point I tell him this is a scam and hang up. I am reporting this as I dont want others to be scammed as once they take control of your COMPUTER anything can happen. It sounded like he was from an indian call center as both times the person had a thick indian accent and I could hear lots of other people in the background making calls. -
Alert! I received an incoming call from this number (9684777) which happened to be an automated voice message when i picked up, saying i have a parcel from singpost and press "2" to speak to the customer service officer (didnt mentioned the purpose of the call). So i pressed "2" and this man asked my nric number and my full name (he asked me to spell it out). I immediately felt suspicious of course and questioned him, he said he needed the information to book the item send to me. ( i was sure as i havent ordered anything), then he mentioned that the sender's details of the parcel is on my name so i have to talk to Guangzhou Interpol officer, he gave me the parcel number and other details and transfer my call to Interpol officer, he was trying to threaten me and telling me that i have to go to Guangzhou to launch a complaint else you will be in trouble. I said i am in Singapore then he asked me to go to a website (gaj.qz.gov.cn) and check the number, till time i googled about them and find that its a scam and cut the call. Please be aware and don't share any details to them even though it's a Singapore number and automated voice message.
I received a phone call today 25/11/2019 at 11.57am from this number - 90043793. Upon answering, i was attended to an automated voice note saying that i have a parcel that hasn't been mailed and enter '3' if i wish to know what parcel it was. reason because i decided to enter '3' - i actually thought it was the parcel i ordered online. however, when i pressed '3', i was directed to a guy whom i assumed to supposedly be representing the parcel company. it was just weird because his voice was sort of echoing and the first thing he asked was who's on the line. and i said my name. weirdly enough, he responded by asking 'are you malay?'. i said yes. he then questioned if i could speak mandarin and i said no. he hung up on me.
Be careful, false singtel operator telling people are connected to my line.
Met this guy in meetup. Messaged me. after few days, we transferred to wechat. His wEchat id: Michael09871. Says he is a residential contractor based in queenstown here in sg. Says also he is american but has chinese ethnicity, never met his dad and only has his mom. At first everything normal. Until he said he went to cambodia coz the building they made collapsed. He didnt asked for money. But he gave me his logins to his bank account called chesterfield mutual bank to transfer money to the building owner. I got suspicious and found out the the bank is fake. Also he does not want to video call. He has a british accent. I think he is using other persons identity but i cannot find his photos in reverse image searches. He really seemed so real and nice and very consistent in his stories. Also believable that he lives too here in sg, only that he travels alot. He is not pushy about love or anything but very caring and concern about you. Beware coz i think this persons behind the picture is very manipulative. I dont think the scammer is the same as the picture though.
I received a call from singapore number 9064 6348. The voice imitates the singtel hotline to inform the user that my singtel line will be terminated soon. if need more info, press "2". I did not proceed further. the call was disconnected if you dont press 2.
i have met online guy from langmate apps but it doesn't list in the listed. so short of the story we're continue to chat by line apps. he claimed that as a gemologist whose living in new york city for almost 3 decades, diamond miner &amp; reseller, and act as a korean guy. we were friend for almost 2 months and he asking about my salary all that. but this guy actually was misused someone picture and i've found out by my friend who's helping me to check using the pictures. he's sweet (too good to be true) caring and etc. luckily i knew before he start to asking anything from me. if any one of you, ladies bump into this guy in online dating apps please don't trust him and don't entertain him. This photo may not even be his!
REceived a call via viber from 'duty free', telling me i have won 50K. the caller was a lady and asked "can you share with me ma'am how you feel about winning?", but i was skeptic and asked, "sorry can you provide my name first?". she just then repeated her entire spiel from the start. so i said, "i don't believe this because i haven't bought anything at changi." so she replied "if you don't believe me ma'am then hang up." i wasn't aware that this was a scam reported on the news 5 days ago, but still reporting it anyway so that you guys are informed that it is still ongoing by the name "duty free" as a caller.
Received a automated phone call from singtel informing me that my mobile phone will be disconnected in 2 hours. Don't believe!
One of those Singtel scams that tells you that your singtel line will be terminated in 2 hours' time. They probably wanted to direct me to login to my personal details to so-call stop the termination but the joke is, i'm on M1, not singtel. So i just hung up. Thought to alert everyone here to alert everyone.
I received this SMS message stated "dear customer, your atm card temporarily has been block. because still you did not update according new rules if you want to activate please call us 31663461. after reading it, noticed something is weird and i called 31663461. first voice message is in Malay and then a man attended. asked the man which bank it was related and he told me (dbs). he ask if the card was with me so to give his the details. i told him the card was not with me. and he told me to call again when the card is with me. i told him "but i dont have a dbs atm card!" and asked him if he was scamming! he immediately cut off the line!!
Have been getting calls from yesterday quoting they are from DHL and i have an unclaimed item and transferred to a customer service agent who speaks in mandarin and once i say i don't in Mandarin they hung up . Have received almost 6 calls since yesterday.
Casually browse wechat nearby feature, found a pretty girl and send HER friend REQUEST. CHATTED for abit and she offer me sex service 100 for 2 hrs. i take up her OFFER and meet her at limbang shopping mcd. When i reached, i went toilet to pee and msg her that i have reached. She said her agent need to call me to verify me FIRST. I sat on the toilet bowl and waited. A chinese speaking guy with unknown NUMBER CALLED and the moment i heard axs machine i hung up. Then he text me with threatening msg saying he is ang soon tong 阿虎. I laughed so hard almost fell off the toilet seat. I knew abt all these sex scams, alipay, itunes long ago so i did not lose anything that day. An advice to all men - it is very simple to detect them. I'm not sure abt other platforms but for WECHAT, the moment they accepted u, they will send u a template giving u their LINE id and WHATSAPP, saying she doesn't use wechat to chat. The hp number will never be local one, it will start with +60 or +852 etc. A simple google will tell u which country code is THAT. They are very pro in convincing u to use the AXS for payment. Already tested with few of them. Their pics are pretty, voice are sweet, concern abt u, yeah i KNOW that but don't for IT!
Call by indian lady claiming to be from S ingtel, receiving a lot of error messages from my clsid. transferred to another Indian man who asked me to run eventviewer on my computer where he showed me logs to convince me that they are receiving the error messages from there. He then tried to ask me to download teamviewer from a bogus site: http://www.worldserver.ga. I told him to hold while I looked for another phone to call police or report scam. But there is seriously a lack of such facilities. Anti-scam helpline is full and asked to leave message when I finally called in. I was hoping someone can trace the numbers. The person hung up as I kept him waiting, but i received calls from these other numbers:+07897564551, +5781156732642, +65156732642, +65390406269 after. Found out that a lady lost 15k because of this.
I received a call supposedly from a SingTel technical consultant (+6564841105) that my router was faulty. He asked to check my router lights and instructed me to type $assoc and another command to get a unique customer identity number. He asked me to verify if my number corresponded to his number. Once that was done, he said he would patch me through to his senior consultant. The call sounded dubious and I hung up immediately. Subsequently I received a call from another Singapore number (+6564354847) and I hanged up as it was the same caller. Next I received another call from (+587973433). I did not pick up the call since it not a Singapore number.
Someone with a thick (what sounded like indian) accent called to say that there are 20 people trying to use my wifi network. Wanted me to go to my router to check something, but i decline. He got angry and questioned why i am so stubborn. Scammer got frustrated by my insistence of not revealing my details!
Received sms from Martin and even went to check his company background. I thought i was being smart by going to the website and checking via the website contact if Martin did work there. The website had a legit REGISTERED business number and i DIDN'T give it much thoughts. I was contacted by mervin via the website Whatsa chat function. He told me that he can assist me instead. He never addressed me martin works for him. The website looked legit so i blindly trusted and submitted aLl my documents thinking i was just getting a quote. Next thing i knEw, i was informed loan APPROVED and i still stupidly thought its from a bank. The next day, i received message from mervin that $700 has been DEPOSITED into my account. I was shocked and all warning bells started ringing. I insisted he take the money back and he arranged to meet me the next day at 2.30pm to explain. At 1.30pm, he messaged me to TRANSFER $1,000 to a posb savings account. I got scared when he threatened to come to my house and just TRANSFERred to him. Then he send another message for $3,000. That’s when i called him and he threatened Me And told me he is loanshark. That all info were fake. I’m shocked by my own stupidity and now want to share this as no matter how educated or highly paid you are, the scammers have a way to tempt you. Mine was low interest rates. I’ve reported to polIce and just installed CCtV at mu house. To take away the power from my Scammers, im sharing this With my boss and colleagues as well my neighbours. I wish i found this page earlier and now I’ll do my part to spread the word.

Lost huge to this scam. Beware please!
I received a call from an unknown number. Heard an automated voice message informing me that I've an unclaimed package. It spoke in English, then Mandarin. I hung up immediately!
Just want to share my story of a scammer who keeps asking me to buy him iTunes cards. At first I didn't think anything amiss and went ahead to purchase it for several times. Later I came across a poster alerting the public about the iTunes gift cards scam. Then I googled this and knew how the scammers cheat people using iTunes card. I then exposed him by sending him the link and he got upset. I just blocked him from Whatsapp. Just beware that not all online acquaintances can be trusted. Stay vigilant at all times!

They made me Call them 4 times a day to keep track Of my whereaBouts and told me that my phone line is being tApped by thEm. I was told that i cannot tell anybody about what happen in order not to get them invOlved and prosecuted as well. They Say that if i dont expedite my investigation, they will freeze my assets for 1.5 years and take me back to china at least 45 days. THey used fear Tactics by telling me how scary the detainment Centers will be. They even said that They have over 70 people in custody and Singaporean familIes over there begging for the authoritiEs to relEase thEir family members. I have made a police Report on this.

Received a phone call from SG Mobile no and after picking up the call there was an automated voice message saying that i have an unclaimed package, and requested me to press '3' for more details. after pressing '3' i was directed to speak with a PRC phone operator from DHL. He requested for my name or package ID before he can check more about the package. After providing my name, he claimed that in his records, i had sent a package from sg to shanghai on 29 Oct and the package was detained by custom as it contained 21 illegal passports. i replied that i was not even around in sg to do so, and the operator acted in disbelief to say that it's impossible because your mobile no. is in the system etc. i ended the phone call after scolding the person to check on their internal system to get things right. i haven't lost my cash per se but in retrospect, i've already unknowingly provided my phone, name and year of birth.
I’ve received 2-3 phone calls within a week from 92855049 as DHL delivery. The audio telling me I’ve got a package and to press 3 if I have not received. I tested to press during the third call and was directed to the operator speaking in Chinese who could not answer my questions. I ended the call.
This was happened yesterday,i inquire about a loan then they ask my ic bank account 2 reference number and payslip.

I ask for his ic then he forward the ic of his admin according to him. Now i read all the stories and check in the website they aren't registered but they claim in ads they are. Please beware!
Got a call from “96606086”; line quality was poor (voip?). Caller was a woman witH indian accent. She knew my name. Said she was from singtel And they had been monitoring my computer Over the past few days and found it had been hacked. She hung up when i asked details about my computer whIch had purportedly been hacked.
Got a computer telling me its from DHL that I got an unclaimed package. Normally the computer voice is Chinese, but this time was first in English, followed by Chinese. Asked me to press "3" to continue. did not do it, I just kill the call.
Actually i first met this guy in instagram then he asked my facebook account and i gave him. I really don’t have any suspicious since he video call me ONCE and he has A very good grammar. We make a CALL AND HE SPEAK REALLY GOOD ENGLISH. Short of THE STORY, i begin to trust him evEN feel IN LOVE. AND I SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING PICTURES AND VIDEO WHICH HE USE LATER TO threaten ME when one DAY HE ASKED FOR MONEY AND I REALIZE THAT HE IS A SCAMMER. I Didn’t GIVE HIM THE MONEY AND I BLOCKED HIM IN EVERY OF MY SOCIAL MEDIA, i deactivated my social media account AND CHANGE all MY NUMBER. I blocked every access for him to contact me. It frustrated me because he knew so much about me. He told me that he listed all my family member and close friend.. But i Told him to do anything he want that make him happy. SO THAT THIS IS MY LESSON FOR NOT TRUSTING SOMEONE EASILY. I share because i care.. Please never share anything to strangers.. You will regret it for the rest of your life. I don’t lose money at all but i guess i lost more than money to him. I feel I lost my way and heart broken. Even until all this time i can’t forget everything and it hurts every time i remember him.
I got 3 calls from DHL in one day (13 November 2019). the first number was at 8671 6137 at 11.04 am, the second one was 8172 0408 at 12.40 pm, third one was 9483 8893 at 2.15 pm. when i picked up the call it was a machine recorded message saying that i have an unclaimed parcel and asked me to press number 3 to speak to a staff. I immediately hung up after that.
Received call from from 9303 1721 this morning 13 November, claiming to be from DHL Changi with automated voice system in both English and Mandarin. It said there is an issue with my shipment and prompted me to speak to a staff. I am expecting a package hence selected option 3 and was connected to a Mandarin speaking staff. I requested to speak to an English speaking staff but was told all were busy. He said my package has been withheld in Beijing and a letter issued stating dangerous content has been found in my package. I replied no way this was possible, feeling suspicious, I said I will call DHL Singapore to verify and caller hung up immediately. I tactlessly gave my DHL tracking number and name away at the start of the call for verification - so they now have a name tagged to my mobile number to carry out more scams in the future (identity theft possibly). Caller's background noise sounded like a call center with many staff busy on the line, however, it could be pre-recorded.
I wish to report a scam caller for DHL delivery scam: Received 2 missed calls yesterday from various local numbers. Today received 2 calls from a number 95890324 1st call AT 12PM, a robot voice says you have an uncollected DHL package. As I had received several packages recently for work, but none for DHL I THOUGHT THE SUPPLIERS HAD SENT A PACKAGE VIA DHL. I pressed 3 AS PER THE ROBOT VOICE INSTRUCTIONS. After a waiting time whereby the line sounded it was connected overseas, a man answered the phone with "Wei?". I responded in Chinese (though I do not speak it) "Ni ser suei?" (Who are you) I SAID. He then responded to say things to me in which I did not understand. The moment he heard me say a word of English he hung up. 2nd call at 12:42 was the same NUMBER, except that the moment the man heard me say "Hello?" he hung up as he knew I was not Chinese speaking. I believe this is a scam calling robot linked to human operators in China, but using local Singapore numbers for credibility. I will report any more I encounter. To confirm the number today was +65 95890324.
I met this girl on okcupid, which then Followed to a line conversation. she offered me $100 for 1.5 hours and asked to meet on 12 nov. when i arrived at the place, she asked me to send her alipay credits to protect herself with my identification card. i then obliged and her boss called me, and asked me to send more. Me, being a gullible student, was afraid of his threats of going to hurt my family, and i obliged in sending more. when i sent $2000, he said that fee was for protecting the girl, then i had to send another $2000 for the hotel room fee. At that moment, the axs withdrawal limit for alipay credits saved me and they told me to use itunes credits instead. i realised i was scammed and went on to make a police report later on.
received 2 calls from 95804232 @10.01am on 12 nov 19 and 9012 9652 @1.14pm on 12 nov 19 from DHL saying I've unclaimed parcel. I hanged up as i did not buy anything online and i am not expecting any parcel. Received another call 82991251 @2.36pm on 12/11/19. but i purposely missed the call so that i can call back the number as i suspect its RE: DHL again. so @2.38pm, i called back but it was on ringing tone for very long so i hang up. @2.39pm 82991251 called back, i kept quiet waiting for the caller to speak first and it was a sound of a young man. I mentioned that i received a missed call from this number and he also mentioned that he is returning the call. So i asked him where is this calling from as i received a missed call from this number. HE kind of stuttered a bit and saying he is returning a missed call. I hung up the call.
1) Supposedly call from Singtel, about a technical error / attack on my home broadband. Told him broadband is not under my name, but my brother's. So caller asked for my brother's contact number. Kept insisting he is calling from Singtel. 2) 12 November 19, 11.09 am 3) Nothing lost, yet.
I received a call from 98708207, claiming that i have not collected a parcel and to press number 3 to speak to a staff. I pressed number 3 and the person started talking in chinese. so, i requested him to speak in english and the person immediately cut the call. i dont know if any of details has been extracted by him as i dialled 3 to connect to him. Simply hang up if you receive such robo calls.
received a call from DHL (automated) 9394 8278 on 11 Nov approx. 12:15pm, saying I've unclaimed parcel. I hanged up immediately. Do not press any number instructed by them, beware!! Please hung up.
I received a call from 93287162 that claims that i have outstanding parcel pending delivery from dhl and press 2 to speak to an operator. the way the operator responded during my conversation sounded SUSPICIOUS which a trained operator would not respond. Immediately, i hung up the call.
SO I got this random phone call like just now from 93720440. Curious, i answered the call and it was an automated call citing i have an uncollected parcel delivered by DHL left in changi airport for few months. it then prompted me to press '2' for more INQUIRES which then a woman requested for my nric and name. i obliged and gave her , and immediately, the phone call hung up.
Met the girl on tinder and matched with her. Then she asked for my whatsapp and I gave it to her. Then she said that she was providing massage services and then told me that we can have sex for $100/2hr as well. I was interested and tried to meet up with her. She told me to go to an apartment at bugis and I waited for her there, then she told me her agent will call me and the agent told me to use alipay. Since I wasn't Singaporean, I asked if there was an alternative, he said to buy iTunes. Then I bought an iTunes card and stupidly scratched off the back and gave them a picture. The agent then called me and said that he needed $1200 dollars as insurance that I was not with the police. I then said that I didnt have that much money since I was a student and he said to borrow from Friends. My phone then died because my battery went flat. After that, when I got home and I charged my phone, the guy called and threatened to kill my family if I didn't cough out the $1200. I have now blocked him and the girl. Don't fall prey to this like me!
received a call from 86277161 @ 09:44am 9 nov 2019 at first i thought i missed a parcel delivery and was ask to provide tracking number but there is no tracking number from my side so name was given to him to check. from there onward, he claimed that i have a parcel TRACKING NUMBER #039258 PARCEL SENT BY ME FROM CHANGI DHL TO GUANGZHOU CHINA RECEIVER NAME FANG JIE. the parcel contained 21 passports and 1 credit card which are now detained by guangzhou customs which require me to do an immediate action with it by transferring the call to china police. i told him this wasn't sent by me because i wasn't around (am outstation) during the date mentioned , he questioned me further could it be someone else use my id to deliver it which is ridiculous. no tracking number found on dhl website. he keep threatening that i am responsible for it. after a long 10 minutes conversation, i decided not to continue with him because i need to work. he hung up the call. i've recorded the conversation from the half way till the end.
Received a call from speedpost from the contact no. 86402398 Claiming that i had an article due for collection as it was the last day for collection. And was Asked to press 2 to speak with a customer service officer. I was informed by the cs officer that there was a parcel of huge quantity wHich i purchased in guangzhou on 21Oct2019. It was now detained at the customs and my record is with guanzhou interpol police. Suddenly in the midst of conversation, i realised that i might have been scammed and hung up. Unfortunately i had released my personal info.
I met him on tinder on the 30 October. He was telling me he LIVEd in Washington and he WORKed supplying something for the shipping industry. He told me he got a 3 months contract job and bought something special for me. He asked for my address. I refused to give. Then he decided to fly to Singapore and see me. He produced a business class Emirates itinerary. I actually believed him. However when he arrived in Singapore, HE said he needed my help to pay $3,500 cause the airport POLICE found out he Brought in foreign currency. I told him I don't know him and so I won't send any money. He said he managed to negotiate down to $1,500. I just blocked him.
Scammer has hacked into a facebook friend's account and contacted me via messenger. the person claimed that a sum of $300,000 was delivered to "My Doorstep within 24hrs when i applied for it". it was claimed that the money was derived from a world bank approved grant through international development association (IDA). i asked to contact an agent called James Mark by clicking a link (link not included).

1) The call seem to replicate the methods of SOP in singtel when dealing with a customer service officer.

Met this guy on tinder, his name is John Lee wong, claimed to be American born Chinese, only has his mum. Oil and gas industry engineer. About 5 days later, claimed he had an interview and will be awarded a contract if he does well for the talk and asked me to wish him luck. Next day, said he was awarded the contract and wanted to buy me gifts. Too good to be true, but I was curious so gave him my address. He sent the package and gave me the link that looks legitimate, www. FirstFlightexpressltd.services. the link looks real and shows THE status of thE package. the courier guy then WHATSAPP me the next day saying that I have to pay SGD3100 as clearance tax. His name is Ken from standard delivery express services (+6590766388). Bank details Name:Zaleha Bte Sawan Account no:MAYBANK SAVING 1-410-04-6590-8
Called to inform that someone/hacker is using my internet at home. But i am not using Singtel broadband
Caller identified as singtel stating that my internet has been compromised by an overseas IP Address. She asked several questions about my network which I refused to answer and instead asked for the IP address that compromised my network. She stated that i need to open a browser on my computer and she will show me. I then asked if she at least can tell me my public ip address. She replied that i need to open a browser as she doesn't have access to a computer right now. I then said that I'm a system administrator and i know my network very well. She then hung up.
Got a call from the number, person identified himself as mark from singtel, he mentioned that several people are hacking my internet account and hence its having problems as I do not use singtel, but rather another provider, i was getting sure that this was a scam. he then asked me WHETHER i pay the bills for my account and when i confirmed yes, he CONTINUED. he asked me to open my computer and tell him what i see on the computer. i asked him if he can speak hindi, judging from his accent. he then first said sorry and after that started abusing in Hindi. hope people know about this scam, as unlike me, several people use singtel at home for internet!
I saw a advertisment for loan and texted back to ask for a loan. he ask me send my ic,payslip and 2 reference numbers to email him so he can process the loan. The person told me he will give me $700 then 5 days later transfer back $1000. i just follow and paid the 700+300. then on the payment he said i for got to add some wording and the company cannot clear the loan because i did not put the correct name when i transfer. he ask me to transfer another $1000. i said i have no money. he is still asking me for money today.
I got an automated message informing me that I have an document at SingPost and message asked me to press 2 for customer service. I got connected to an customer service officer and she asked me for my details, which I sadly gave. I was then told that a parcel coming from Guangzhou has been detained at customs as it contained contraband items. I was asked to head to Guangzhou to settle the issue. It was at this point that I realised that it was a scam and hung up.
I would like to share my experience of how i got scammed in facebook. I added this girl name of shaira ong on facebook and she claimed to be a social escort in singapore offering sexual services. I wanted to engage her services for two hours and the fee was 150sgd so she asked me to transfer it to a posb saving account whom she she claimed as her admin's account. We agreed to meet at Jurong east street 13, block 133 at a coffeeshop below the block. After reaching she said she needed another 170 sgd to be transfered to her admin's posb account as she got a penalty from her admin for agreeing to meet me at a earlier timing instead of the timing we fixed earlier on facebook messenger. She had promised to pay me back in cash after we met so i agreed and transfered but right after i transfered she asked me to do a western union transfer to her boss in phillipines whose name is of danica artocilla. She asked me to do a transfer of 250sgd in western union to her boss and she said that fee was to cover her rental in the room she is staying as if she dont pay for room rental, she wont be able to meet me. So i did do a western union transfer to her so called boss in phillipines but after that she kept giving lots of excuses and empty promises of returning me back my money in cash when we meet but i waited for 4 hours but she didnt turn up. That's when i knew i was scammed and made a police report. I transfered a total of 1.3ksgd in total to her in that four hours i waited for her. My advice to everyone is not to fall for this type of scams in facebook where girls claim themselves as escorts offering sexual services. It's all a scam.
I met this 24 yo chinese girl on okcupid. We chatted for 4 days and decided to have a video call.

She wanted $600 at first &amp; promIse me that she would delete the video. i didn’t transfer the money &amp; she Decided to send in to All my friends &amp; famIlies members with screenshot. When i was home, I checked with my Family members but they didn’t receive any message from the lady.
I received a call from viber, his account name is duty free. He told me that i won $50,000 from Changi airport. He confirmed my mobile number and the first 8 digit number of my atm. Next is he wants to have a video conversation and he is asking to take a video of the atm card. I doubted that i won the lucky draw and he keeps on insisting on it. He called again 4 times after I dropped the call.
1) Enquired with this person about loan as i was in a bit of financial difficulties then proceed on to ask me for my personal details. Later on told me my loan was approved but need to either pay deposit…... 2) HAPPENED DATE ON 19/10/2019 3) I LOST ABOUT 700$
This morning (20 Oct 19) I received a phone call at 1104hrs from a lady (China accent) who identified herself as a staff from Changi DHL through this phone number: +6593400611. She told me that at China customs, they found and retained a package containing 21 passports &amp; 11 credit cards which bears my phone number: 98385962. She mentioned that this package (package ID: 168956) was sent out from Changi DHL to China, Shang Hai (Sheng Jiang, Yan Yang Lu No.161), to a person named 'Chen Wen Jun' on 02 Oct 19 at 1027hrs. She asked me if this package was sent out by me which i told her that i did not send out any package to China. Thereafter, she said, "Your personal particulars might have been compromised. My superior say that the only way to help you now, is to quickly make a police report to keep the police aware that your identity had been misappropriated. Let me divert you to Police HQ to initiate the police report and record your statements. Pls pressed '999' to talk to the Police Officer to record your statement." At this moment, i felt very fishy about this situation. Next moment, after pressing '999', a guy (China accent) took over the phone which somewhat increase my suspicion that this is a scam call. I was thinking since when did Singapore Police hired China international as their staff. The guy started by asking what he can help. i told him that i would like to make a police report, pertaining to a case of misuse of my identify for illegal purpose. He asked me what my official name was, and start to ask if i had misplaced or dropped my pink IC, Driving license &amp; passport before and i replied him 'No'. Then he further probed, "How can that be ?! You never booked your air tickets using passport before ?!" and i said 'yes.. but it is all done online'. Then he started to sound agitated a bit and start to ask for some other details which i don't quite get what he wants. So i told him to get a English speaking Police Officer to talk to me instead. Without replying, the guy hung up the phone. The call ended at around 1139hrs.
I met this guy from CMB. Coffee meet bagels dating app. he first claimed malaysian genting. original from pahang, moved to Hong kong at age 17, continue stay there until recently being sent back to genting highland to work for an year. his CMB profile will state he wants long term relationship. (this is the bait) he put he is food and beverage director. he will send voice msg in cantonese to malaysian to test if you will reply in chinese. he sent me his hong kong PR ID to show he is real. First attempt: he said just reached singapore for work and he forgot to bring his laptop. he wants to lend old laptop from me. i don't have so i ask him to rent somewhere. 2nd attempt: 8am, he said he needs my help as his staff still sleeping and he is at myanmar embassy applying visa and he has no ringgit in his bank account malaysia, ask me to transfer rm130, and another SGD40, to his bank account. i didn't i ask him to wait for his stupid staff. then i recalled, he said before he doesn't has malaysia bank account cos he doesn't need any. but when he asking for money he said i can bank into his maybank or public bank. Attached with his photo, conversation and ID. im not sure is his profile being fraud or he himself is the scammer. but is better to alert more people.
At first i just inquire thru the website regarding how to make a loan. The next day, they whatsapp saying they are from legal moneylender and they want my applications. At first they dont even mention that it was weekly payments. In the middle of the night i told them to cancel the request as i am not interested but they said had been transferred and all. They asked for a picture of my house door and all. On the first payment i made was 200 they give me an acct number. Second was on the 8th oct i thought was the same acct number but they say thats their customer and that does not count. I felt sceptical since that they must wait for next acct. 3rd payment was 12th oct 200. Basically ive paid 800 but then on the 12th then explained all that is defer PAyment.. they inform me to clear have to make 600 one shot payment so i told them on the 18th i will clear. They give me their own acct number which is dbs account number. And now im a stress up cause they say not counted too as it supposed to be 200 on that acct then 400 wait for their next acct number. What should i do. I'm ignoring them since yesterday and just afraid they hunt my parents and hurt my little son. Please help me. And since on the 2nd or 3rd repayment ive been telling this nick im at station working. Its a lied to stop them from coming but i dont think they believe me.
connected through tinder with this person from perth who said he is a single father to a 4 year old girl called "katie". He said he grew up in usa (funny he didn't have an American accent but an irish one instead) and had moved back to perth to restart his life and set up his business in seafood broking after ex wife died of car crash. After a couple of weeks of chatting online, he professed how he was into me without having met me in person yet and the next thing I knew, he was going to come to Singapore to meet up and also clear his shipment at jurong island at the same time. then came one afternoon when he asked to borrow 3k due to stock clearance issue at customs and had a shortfall of cash. I then declined to help politely and suggested he could arrange to get an overdraft from the bank after which, he started to get passive aggressive about me not willing to help. I then tried him again and offered that I would help to pay on condition that I would meet him in person to pay directly to whoever he owed but he insisted that I transferred money to a personal bank account of "hua siew moy" in which I declined and persisted with my conditional offer. he then started getting angry and told me to keep my money which I did.
Enquired with this person about loan as i was in a bit of financial difficulties then proceed on to ask me for my personal details. Later on told me my loan was approved but need to either pay deposit or meet his worker face to face to verify. I then chose to meet and he gave me an address to go. Upon reaching the unit after sending photo coincidentally the owner was leaving home, i then proceed to clarify with the owner to only realise i was made used to check on another person whom had owed UML. We then made an police report and investigation is still pending.
I received a call from "Singpost" claiming i had a parcel that must be collected today. Press "2" to be put thru to singpost. I pressed "2" and was connected to a person who took my name &amp; Singapore FIN (as I didn't have a parcel slip number to refer to). They then explained that there was a problem with a parcel I had sent which had illegal contents, from guangzhou international airport. They put me thru to an official who, by way of authentication, called me from a caller-ID which matches the phone number at http://gaj.gz.gov.cn. Seemed legit, although i realise I should have called that number rather than let them call me, as caller-ID may not be trustworthy... They proceeded to get me to send pics of both sides of my singapore IC, a selfie and my singapore drivers license. eventually a friend and work colleague looked at what i was doing and passed me the link to this site where i searched and quickly found these similar stories. I then hung-up the call. But so much information given away already :-(
Received a call from 84977034. Picked up and it was a lady with an indian accent on the other end. She claimed to be from singtel. The line was very noisy and kept breaking off and i had to get her to repeat herself multiple times. She claimed that there was suspicious activity from my router these couple of weeks. Problem is that my broadband line is under my parent's name and they shouldn't be calling me if there is a problem in the first place. Hung up on them and called SingTel to verify and to no surprise, nobody at SingTel contacted me and there was no problem with my internet at all.
Received a call from someone saying he is from singtel tech support, said his name is mark williams, has an indian accent. said that he can see malicious activities on my home and office wi-fi network and needed to know how many devices i have connected to the internet. i said i am not using singtel for internet, and he insisted that their unit oversees all internet providers and insisted on me sharing the number of devices I have connected to the internet. i hung up the phone after.
He offered me a loan and i said how much would the interest be? he said 30K 570x60 monthly u ok? i said what is the qualifications? He said how much your salary? Sent me your IC so that I could check if you are qualified. suddenly your loan is approved. i said i dont need the money yet, he said like that can not ! you just transfer me 500 and after confirmation return me 800 then after 2 hours i will send you the full amount 30K. why do i need to pay you extra 300? that is the policy for first timer. i said i didn't want, what if you send me the amount you want and send you back the same amount. he said no can not. then I decline offer to take the loan from him.

Received 2 calls today. The callers had very strong Indian accent. They said they were from starhub and singtel and said they received a lot of warning message from my router. They asked me to look at my router to see how many lights were blinking. Knowing this is likely a scam, i tested them further. i asked if they need to talk to my son who were more tech-savvy, they said no need. so i was right. I told them that I could not check for them. They immediately hung up the phone.
Received a call in the morning from 83468663 and the person had a strong indian accent. background was noisy and he took some time to respond after i said 'hello'. he claimed to be from 'singtel technical department' but i thought it sounded fishy and just hung up. a few hours later another number 69897609 called and it was the same person from the 'technical department of singtel' this time i listened to him a little longer and he said my router had some issues to which i replied there was no issues with my router. he then said there was a unusual amount of usage or something like that and asked about my family members who use the internet at home. i hung up after this. I do use singtel but throughout the calls i knew that they wouldn't make such calls and they wouldn't call me as my parents who are the subscribers should've been called first.
He called and said my internet connection was slow and wanted to help me resolve the problem. I kept questioning him about the exact plan i have and he kept saying "Internet line" and "please go to you modem to check how many lights are blinking. I hung up.
Email received from lady enquiring about room rental. Beware of those free rental online sites as i suppose it came from there. - she replied my email quickly and always rushing me to get back to her and that she will pay in advance the money to secure the room. - i got suspicious when she transferred more money than i asked for and insisted that i help her transfer the extra money she sent to her mover and she gave me mover address which is in uae. - my suspicion was arose because she was quite rude on the email by insisting that i must help her pay the mover else she can't get her stuff over to singapore. - i was almost prepared to help her pay but i figured i will wait until i receive all the funds before i do that. - because she was rude, i told her off on the email and even said i won't transfer as she didn't ask for my permission on the help. - but she replied and still insisted i help her do the transfer and that's where i got more suspicious and decided to ignore her. i waited more than 1 week and checked paypal a few times but still received no funds. please beware of the language used as i realised their english is not proper considering she's a singaporean.
Received this SMS 15 min ago that said from Sheng Siong “Dear Customer, You have 15091 points that must be used before they expire tonight, 14/10/19. More info here: http://8fr.me/ukNi?(FAKE email)
An Indian lady claimed that she is from SINGTEL AND IS CHECKING A Internet problem. I was suspicious as it was unusual SINGTEL will contact me as I have not raised any issues on my internet. I asked her "are you trying to scam me", and she hung up.
It's started inviting me to friend in FB.. I accepted afterwards he gave me his number in whatapp. We talk there almost everyday until he professed his in love with me because I'm caring and understanding. Me so gullible answered him. He said he has one son and old mom. I believe everything he said because he said trust me. I started to get doubts when he avoid video call. He call me twice only. He send me pictures but he seems not American as what he says. His more like white Indian. I didn't tell him my doubts until he keep me sending pictures which seems not in Africa. Until one day he think he already make me really in love with him and he sure I believed everything she says... He said his hotel was robbed his son get hurt with the gun and the officer is dead. He got all his belongings and I'm only person can help him. Even his company got angry with him and no friends wants to help. I ask him how can be assured his telling the truth he send me picture of the son in the hospital which I doubted all the more because he says his in Africa for work but people around the hospital look like Chinese. So I blocked him even though keep insisting to call me.

It started off with knowing this person from social media. I added him on wechat. There, this person offered sex services at a rate of $100/90min. I was curious and agreed to the offer. When i reached the place, she asked for my mobile number and told me that there shouldn't be any cash transaction and instructed me to pay for the service at axs machine. After that, she told me that her boss needed to advise me on some security issues. He required me to buy Alipay credit through the axs machine, which i dumbly followed despite seeing all the warning. Just when i thought it's done, he demanded more deposits for security purposes. He kept pressing me to put down the deposits to the point when i told him i have no money and would not want to continue and requested for the deposited money to be returned, he said this os not possible, and even threatened that even if i were to forfeit the initial amount they will send someone to deliver it to my home and will demand to pay for the delivery fees that can amount to $6000. When i said that i had no money then says he can reduce the amount. And lucky for me, the limit of nets purchases and Alipay top up had prevented me from completing all the transactions that amount to $6,600. Throughout he also asked me not to put down the phone (and the number either origins from Indonesia (+62000000001) or is hidden) this repeats for verification purposes, for refund purposes. Why i sucked up to their promises that the money will be refunded based on their rule... Throughout the event they spoke in Taiwanese mandarin and i corresponded only to the person that i added on Wechat. The rest of the phone calls were incoming from this 'boss'. After being asked for more money and threatened that they belong to a black society in taiwan and the boss is that of marina bay sands, i felt something is really not right and reported to the police. Lesson learnt, be careful, when befriending unknown people on social media.
Met jimmy on CMB Within a day, he asked me to follow his instagram id: jimmykasun. We then moved to ig for chats. In there, he told me he is an orphan of chinese origin, adopted by a rich family in uk, grew up &amp; educated in uk, recently spent usd $5Mil to divorce his wife. However, his tone and way of expressing a bit childish, Doesn't sound like someone who's in his late 40S, gone thru so much and doing a successful biz. He said he was in sg Because plan to start a CONSTruction company in sg. But when i asked DId he made friends wih anyone when in sg, he said i am the only one, the other one a hotel manager in sg. When i became suspicous abt his identity, i looked thru his ig profile and notice his photos were few and recently uploaded. Most of His 'followers' LOOKs like FROM SEA, with very few caucasian looking ONES. Something unusual for someone who has grown up and worked in uk all these while. He did NOT ask to meet me or speak with me over phone, but got so CHILDISHLy offended when i asked him for a selfie photo. I suspect this is a scammer who has stolen SOMEONE'S ig account to con PEOPLE. I hv SINCE BLOcked him and unfollowed him. But notice recently his follower group has grown bigger. He might change his name to continue cheating others, so pLEase check out this profile picture and beware.
1. They contacted my dad that M1 now offers $300/year instead of $40/mth for home WiFi. My dad asked them to contact me instead. 2. On 12 oct, a guy called Chris called using the number 96336929. He then explained how the plan works &amp; the amount that we can save if we decided to go for this deal. Furthermore, this deal is only valid for today. He even offered to give me a discount. The final deal will be $250 for 1 complete year of WiFi services Upon further enquiring on what action is needed to take up this deal, I was told to purchase 250 worth of Google play cards from 7-11. After that, call 6531290703 and look for Chris at extension no 101 AND give him THE 16 digits alphanumeric code That is on the card. I told him that I'll do it later And call him later at 6pm. After that, I proceeded to M1 shop to confirm if there is such a deal and was told that I probably encountered a scammer!
Caller called on viber. His nickname is Changi Airport. He has a strong Indian accent and he told me that I've won $50K from Ishop. I knew immediately that it was a scam as legit organisation won't contact you via VIBER!
I was contacted via some foreign number which i hang up multiple occasions. But in Jan this year, I picked up the call and caller sold me proposal to trade online. I was asked to deposit USD$100 at the beginning and started trading. When I "made some profits", i put down more money and I saw a profit of "$50K" in my trading account. As time passed, the contact with the broker got less frequent. Then come to the point suddenly the broker disappear and became uncontactable. I couldn't reach anyone via phone, email or even skype. So i was running solo for the following few months. I decided that i can do trades on my own. Yes, i have traded on my own and over the next 3-4 month and made a profit of almost 300% of my invested capital. The problem comes when i have make request for withdrawal of my profits over the few months, i couldn't get a single cent back. The request always get rejected by the system. Can you imaging that i made over 40 requests and not a single times get approved? Yes, this is where i know i am being scammed of my hard earned savings. I am convinced that i couldn't get back any amount back as this is totally a scam organisation i am dealing with. My lesson here is not to trade online! and put down all my savings. I hope my story can help to caution people not to believe such quick-to-get-rich scheme. Think before you act. My money lost is a lesson learnt.
a guy who claimed that he is from wyndham vacation and said that i am selected to get a special vacation treat on 10th october 2019 time 1640, and mentioned that i need to answer 5 pre-requisites questions asking me more of my personal details such as my marital status. later he also shared that i could just use sgd 99 to choose 3 special destination, bangkok, phuket or indonesia. when i told him i find it too good to be true and refuse to answer his questions that i find it is personal, he later said his time is precious and hence hung up. i later tried to call up to make sure that the number is valid, this time a lady picked up the call and told me another story about their company is promoting a great deal promotion but first i need to again answer the 5 questions before i can proceed and before they sent an confirmation email to my mailbox. this time i chose to just hung up. If you received such cold calls, simply ignore and don't provide yoour info.
Encountered from paktor app, profile was facebook verified. He requested we chat on line app and gave me his userid to add him. Thru photos and conversations, seems like a dream man, good looks, well to do, can cook, go gym and exercise, caring, sweet talk etc. (too good to be true so beware!) So thru chats, i understood he was a christian, went to city church mission. He was a singaporean, parents and sister passed away in car accident when he was 5 and was brought to moscow by his uncle. His uncle had tumor cancer and is in critical condition at raffles hospital now, he even sent me a photo of a patient lying in a hospital bed. We chatted on phone once, and i started to doubt his nationality so did some questioning, and he said mom and uncle was thai, dad was singaporean. I wasnt convinced since it was not consistent to what i understood before. He is working as a designer per time while hoping for an interview call for a maritime job. Twice, we arranged to meet but it never happen because of his work. One day, the call came and he had to go out to south china sea to work in the rig for 7 weeks. At week 2, he asked me to email his company to request for a 3 days leave for him so he can come to sg to meet me. Although weird for me to apply his leave for him i agreed to do so, the email address he provided was a gmail which aroused suspicion, since he mentioned his company was conocophillips i was expecting a company domain. I emailed anyway and recieved a reply saying for him to leave the rig there was a transport fee. I showed him the email and he asked me to pay this fee first and that he will return to me once he landed. His reason was because he has no money while in the rig. I refused since it made no sense. He was agitated when i asked if he was a scammer. I ignored his texts and thought it was the end but he was persistent, continued to shower me with care, and later said he managed to borrow part of the amount from a friend and asked me to lend the balance, so i blocked him on the app!
This guy with a strong Indian accent called my mum up, (shes not the account holder of singtel) and without any form of verification, they said there was a routine internet problem. My mum was irritated as the routine was very different from what singtel usually does (they ask to talk directly to the account holder), and told the guy off, but he was still persistent, however he had an audibly irritated tone. He answered rudely, saying that this is why singtel hired me for the IT department. he then asked to press windows r, which we did at first, but then when he asked to key something in, we immediately cancelled it and told him to call the account holder himself if he was still persistent.
Received a call saying i have a parcel delivery from automated machine. Knowing its a scam, i feel i have to scold the scammer. I pressed 5 to speak to the customer service. a man called shun feng with a strong Chinese accent spoke to me and ask me for the name. He hung up when I confronted him for scamming. The number that was shown on my caller ID was fake.
i am a 50 Year Old singaporean running a local music retail company with a partner. i ran into some credit card debts and due to some late payments and poor payment record could never secure any term loan to clear the debts with any local banks received a watsapp message from this person eric wong claiming to be from bst credit pte ltd did a google search and found that bst credit was a legal licensed money lender so i trusted him his first message was this: Hi.i am Eric Wong from BST Credit Pte Ltd Offers You Promotion Loan In Town . 5kClear 450x12Month 15kClear 825x20Month(Whatsapp 86703871/ 98106009)UN/UNSUB i took up his offer on the 15k loan by replying to his message this was on 21st sep 2019 he replied to say that the offer has expired and i have to make some transactions with his company to show that i am a old account holder to be entitled for the offer and i naively took his words for it. he then transferred S$460.00 into my dbs bank account to show that he is genuinely helping me to secure the loan. he said i can return the S$460.00 with interest by transferring 2 payments of S$250.00 back into the uob savings account i was flying off to japan on 25th sep so i hurriedly made the ibanking first transfer bank to him 5 days later he replied again ( always with a recorded vocal message ) to say he is processing the loan and that i can transfer the 2nd part of S$250.00 back to him. 2 days later he again messaged to say the S$460.00 loan clearance was 3 x S$250.00 and not 2 x S$250.00. i started getting suspicious when he also said that my loan is getting some trouble getting approved cos the boss found out i was asking from many other credit companies ( which is not true ) . yesterday 8/10 at 1PM he asked for the 3rd payment of S$250.00 before 3PM and i already was not comfortable but still transferred him that 3rd payment of S$250.00. after that i said i will go and meet him at his office in jurong and asked for his business registration number. this is when he stops responding i must have been too desperate to clear my debt to be so gullible. I am not seeking to get back the S$250+ that i lost out but just want to have the authorities help prevent him from scamming another victim.
Got SMS offering loan. Contact them to enquire. This guy said can approve but must do credit trust loan of $800, to be repaid at certain dates. Give me cash of $500. When time to "pay" the $800, keep saying account closed so need to postpone at $200 each time. Postponed many times. Finally, realise it was all a scam. Tell them to cancel and refund, he refused and said must paid 10% of loan amount to cancel. Called my office. My Details given to him. Lodged report after gt credit said not from them.
This is the third time i received the call. The first number was +96911810, then was +93111244757, and today was 83342841. All three calls were received in the last 7 days. First it was a guy who called and claimed to be from SingTel Internet Department, and wanted to check if I was the owner of the Internet connection. When I asked what was my SingTel account number, he hung up. Then, came another call, again from the same department. She told me the same issue and I asked her what was my account number. This time, the caller told me that she didn’t have the info and when Then came another call to ask me to key in some commands into my command prompt. After giving me a list of instructions, he tried to convince me to install 'ultraviewer', which is a free remote access software. Using that he wanted to get into my computer. I told him i downloaded it (which, of course i didn't) and he asked for the username and password. I shared a fake username and password. He was unable to get access to my computer with it (how would he?). He then asked if the number was correct and i told him, of course not, i am not dumb to let some stranger in my system and that this scam has been going on for a long time and no one will fall for it anymore. He finally hung up! Point to note, there was a lot of background noise. I could hear other people talking as though it was a call centre. Be aware, and do not share your information or allow access to anyone through your computer
I received a call stating that i have an unclaimed postmail from my local singpost branch. the phone number asked me to press 2 review the package and suddenly the caller hung up on me. Note that SingPost doesn't have such a process. If an item is undelivered, they will NOT call you but instead will leave a note for you to collect your parcel from a SingPost branch or Popstation. https://www.singpost.com/online-security-you If in doubt, call the company's official hotline to check.
Some guy called me claiming to be from ica. he asked me to go to an isolated place immediately and answer his questions. he then asked me if i am at my workplace or home, i told him i am at my workplace. he then asked me since how long i am staying in singapore, i told him if you are from ica you should know this, he said yes we know everything about you but this is for verification. iI told him i am not comfortable in answering these questions as i have no proof that he's from ICA, he said ok then we will pick you from home and take you in custody and then he disconnected the call.
I got a strange text message reading: Dear (my full first name), this is a notice that we imposed fees on you for not returning the parcels to us despite several reminders. See here pq6en.fun/b11bao (phishing site!) LINK goes to a spamy site. Text from phone number 910-629-1735. I replied "who or what is this?" and received a text-reply from a different number, 607-283-2286. I then realised that it might be a scam! Please do not click on links without checking the authenticity as well as do not reply to any unknown text as it will only validate your number! Be wary!

Person called from number +18003916152 (in the morning while i was on train) / +18003918988 (then called again since the first call was not heard properly) impersonating him as an ICA officer from singapore. He said that the Indian consulate has requested a deportation order. Reason cannot be disclosed. He spoke so confident and arrogant, that you will feel shaken up emotionally. But then, i recollected myself and asked for his employee id. He gave an employee id immediately without hesitation and asked me the reason for asking employee id. I stated that i wanted to check the genuineness of the caller, before continuing the conversation. I asked him to be on phone so that i can initiate a parallel call with ica for verification. He immediately hung up.
It was about 8pm when i arrive to the scene as the scammer suggested i was so excited to meet the girl as the girl was really pretty. She ask me to take a photo of where i am at and then proceed to ask me for my phone number, so i give her my phone number in exchange to contact her but somehow i end up talking to a dude which also logical since maybe i think he was an agent or some sort.So she then told me to buy mol worth of 71.67$ so i done it.fyi the application that i spoke with her is MIchat after a short while the agent call me asking me to pay additional 477.83$ for deposit and will give it back and the reason for the deposit is to avoid any aggressive act towards the girl. so i told him i cant pay that much as i'm still a student so i pay half of it instead of 477.83 i payed 238.91$ but not long he ask to pay additional 238.91$ since all customer did that and its unfair. so i proceed to give him that sum of money. moving on he began told me to pay another 716.74$ to insure of our safety when we get to the place. but i refuse because i did not have that sum of money so he suggested to ask for my ic photo front and back so being the dumb ass i am i gave him and from that he still wants the money regardless and began using the info i had given to make death threat towards me and my family and even give me look at video that they gonna do to me. So i panic and seek guidance but in the end i decided to leave even though the scammer keep asking me to stay and will call me at 10pm which he did but it was 11 pm but i did not pickup is because i was on the phone to ask for help.In the i just ran and told him the money that i gave u could have it.
Carousell buyer offered $1400 for my second-hand macbook without negotiation. Asked me to pay $61 cash first for Fedex delivery because son was in Malaysia and needed the laptop urgently. The "sister" of the buyer arranged everything and showed proof of successful transfer made to my account. No money came through and I lost my laptop and money paid to "Fedex"!
This guy followed me on Instagram. He told me that his parents are Singaporean but he is born and raised in London. He said he is a pilot of Thai airways. After a few exchange of msgs in Instagram he asked for my whatsapp number. After giving my number, the next day, I realised that I couldn’t find his Instagram page anymore. After a week, he then told me that he sent me a parcel with gifts from him since i’ve been a REAL friend and he got selected to fly the plane with the UN Secretary after a successful interview. He insisted on sending a package containing luxury items such as Chanel handbag, jewellery, valued at GBP$15,000. He sent me a receipt of his transaction and track code. Today, he asked me if I’ve received the package as his was an express courier. When I asked him to check with the courier directly, he was full of angst and told me that he wasn’t in Singapore. When I went to the website to check and was told that I needed to pay S$1750 as my parcel was overweight. This is obviously a scam, so beware ladies when chatting with online friends!
Received an automated call from "SingPost" informing me that I've an unclaimed parcel. And requested me to press 2 to speak to an officer. Message had a thick Chinese accent. At first, I was confused as i was expecting some deliveries so i pressed 2. 'singpost officer' had a Filipino accent and background was very noisy,not like an office setting. she asked for my full name and ic number to 'check' what triggered the automated call but i asked her if i can give my address to track the parcel instead and she hung up on me. Thank goodness no personal information was given.
Got a call saying about internet connection. as soon as i hear that i just ended the call and assumed that it is definitely a spam call since i have been getting calls from the so called "dhl" for the few months. so i came here to see if there are any similar stories and i really see some similar cases. the caller has an indian accent and when i picked up the call it seems like her connection problem has more serious problem than mine as she said hello for quite a few times. phone no:65 69502519

i received a call with distorted connection from a guy with indian accent claiming he is calling from singtel technical department. he claimed that my internet connection with singtel is having some problem and that they received an alert, hence following up with me. he started by asking me to check my router and let him know how many lights are blinking. i told him i'm not able to do that because I'm not at home. he then asked me what time can he call back, which i told him there is no need to because my internet is not even from singtel. he then repeat himself by emphasizing that he is calling from singtel technical department, so on and so forth; i hung up his call.
This john person contacted me and told me that my singtel wifi had been hacked into, and was used by 20 or 30 people currently. Finding this highly unusual, I proceeded to ask for his name and told him that I would check with singtel directly if this was the case. He paused for a moment before giving me his name, which I also found suspicious. Called singtel to check further and they said that there was no such thing going on with my wifi, and that this was a scam.

Got a call today (1/10/2019 at 10:30 am) where the lady said she is calling from Singtel and that they have noticed many foreign ids accessing my computer and she will help me flush them out. I asked her how i can verify that she's calling from Singtel. She asked me to login to my computer, access my cmd prompt and type "assos". Then she read back a no displayed as clsid. then she asked me to close the cmd prompt and type another command. Luckily for me my phone had very little charge and got disconnected. She called me back as soon as my phone was put in the charger. I felt a little uneasy by then and told her that i cant speak to her then. She asked me when i'll be free and said she'll call back then. I told her to leave her no with me and said i'll call her instead. Immediately she cut the call. She had a distinct PHILIPPINE accent. later i browsed to see if it was a scam and found that it was. Don't follow stranger's instructions blindly!
IPhone XS MAX 256GB ADVERTISED at a good price at GUMTREE but did not use the Gumtree platform for payment. communicated via whatsapp and Instead wanted half price up front and the rest at delivery.

Seller sent me hER (supposed) NRIC as well to "authenticate" hER identity.After that gave the a lot of story and didn't deliver the Phone. I have lost SGD700.
A call from "SingPost" came through. It was really weird call. Thereafter, received this message to my phone from "Delivery" informing my package with singpost was detained in terminal:HTTP://IFNST.COM/BB? (phishing site) Don't click on the link as it will only bring you to a phishing site.
The caller claimed to be a staff of SingTel. Informed me that my network is compromised. In order to secure my internet, She asked that I turn on my computer to download team viewer so that she can access my computer remotely. She hanged up the phone when I questioned her intention. (FYI my broadband provider is not with Singtel. I knew at the start the call is a scam.) CAller is a lady and speaks with an indian accent and it sounds like she is in a call center environment as i could hear a lot of talking in the background.
1) Received a call from this girl (that might have an indian accent) that said she was from singtel telecommunications techinical service department and told me that my internet has been compromised. 2) it happened in the middle of the day at 2:03pm. through a phone call. 3) she said she was calling from singtel but i am not a singtel user. then she said that they are the mother of all tlecommunications in singapore and they found a breach in our internet and that it has been compromised by outside users. then she asked for the number of bars on my router. so i told her i was not at home, then she wanted to call me back in the evening. so i told her that i do not stay at home, then she hung up the call immediately. she is clearly suspicious because she did not have my name, and did not address me properly, and spoke as if she reheared the line about the compromising of internet multiple times. then when i asked her for her name and what her department was again, she replied with a "huh?" in a completely different tone, showing a slight change in character. i think she knew that i was getting suspicious and hence she hung up the phone before anything, however, had i continued, they might have asked for router numbers and may attempt to hack into your system. do beware.

Example of the scam message: He started off as posted to SG from US, based in Chong Pang Camp then after that was sent to a mission in SYRIA. In syria, he was so ill after a chemical explosion and below are the stories he shared: -I will need to present my exit form which is part of the documents I had earlier deposited with a security company attached with the United Nations for safekeeping.. -Baby since I’m in the war zone it’s difficult at this moment and without my exit form I won’t be allowed to leave. I would not be able to contact the military board from here due to restrictions as you may know by now. -Baby, I will need your assistance. I will like you to do me a favor to request for my exit form on my behalf from the military board. -I will write the letter for you to contact the military board on my behalf requesting for my exit form. It’s will be given to you. Here at the war zone we can’t receive or send stuffs. -Once you receive it, I will teach you how to scan and send me a copy through email baby. -I will send you the security company’s email -Baby, I will like to plead with you to handle this on my behalf. You do everything for me if they might need payment. I promise to refund it to you once I come back. It’s unfortunate I can’t access my account here due to restrictions.
It started off with the girl approaching me on Tinder. After a short interesting chat, I added her on Whatsapp as she requested. There, she suddenly offered sex at a rate of $100/90min. I agreed to the offer. When I reached her place, she told me her boss need to advise me on some security issues. He required me to buy Alipay credit through the AXS machine, which I dumbly followed despite seeing all the warning. Just when I thought it's done, he demanded deposits for security purposes. He kept pressing me to put down the deposits even when i told him i have no money, asking me to borrow from friends first. He also asked me not to put down the phone. This repeats for Verification purposes, for refund purposes. Why i sucked it up is their promises that the money will be refunded based on their rule. after being asked for more money for bank acc protection purposes, i got fed up and went to the police to report the case. learnt my lesson with 3k gone and the fear that my family will be targeted by the syndicate.
it was on the 28th Sep at about 1020am when A guy with heavy indian accent called me on my mobile and cAimed he’s a staff of ISp which provides Internet service for companies like singtel and starhub. He claimed that on their end, they Received info that my router is being used for illegal activities. he asked me to check for the number of lights Blinking on my router. I asked him what illegal activities were detected and he gave me a Name which i couldn’t make out what he was blabbering about. it Sounded like dream-soMething. I then told him that i am reporting this to the police instead and he asked me to go ahead While he hold on to the line. he said that he Could provide his staff details and such but i hung up the phone instead. i tried calling the number back after awhile but no one picked up.
The person called stating that he is from singtel and that my internet connection has been hacked. I asked him to verify my details such as my account number which he couldnt and After which he dropped my line. Please end such calls immediately and do not accede requests for money or info.
Met him on cmb. Claims that his mother is from singapore but estranged. He said he has never been to singapore but one of his photos is at kim seng bridge. Claimed to be a consultant from la, who has many cats and dogs. Kept saying he is chinese but he sounds like of south american accent. He called several times and i believe he stole someone's identity. The photos are not consistent with what he kept describing himself to be.
I received a call at 1032am on 26 sep 2019, with an automated voice speaking in Mandarin telling me that there is a document for me at the police station and that i needed to press 1 to proceed. i hung up after. no further details were furnished over the call.
I connected with him on a dating app called paktor. Within talking for a day, he ask to exchange numbers and to chat on whatsapp.He say he's from america and his parents are from sg but had passed away when he was 4. He grew up in the states with his uncle. Claimed that his parents own a house in clementi.Within less than a week of chatting he confesses to me saying how he likes me and wants to relocate to sg. Called me once via whatsapp call, his accent sounded legit american accent (i did read about the scams beforehand) his english is still quite good. (maybe the scammers now got an upgrade of their skills)Anyway after all this, he started his story saying that he will be flying to kuwait to work at an oil rig for 3 weeks contract. (scam alert!)And that is where i started believing that he is a scam and i tried to say to him that there's alot of scammers nowadays posing as oil rig workers. And i ask him if he's for real. He got all sad about it and saying that he's not.Even after what i trying to expose him as a scammer, he still try to talk to me. Until one day he suddenly disappeared for 2 days and came back with an excuse that he was busy and that his equipment is spoiled. And he start to show his true colors by saying that he has to pay for the spoiled equipment. I googled alot of these most oil rig companies are supposed to pay for spoilt equipment if under contract or insurance. I told him all this and he still insisted that he have to pay on his own since its his equipment. I try to avoid the question of money but he still comes up with a reason that i have already read before in the scam stories. Saying that he can't open his offshore account and that he need to transfer money into that account. I knew he is going to ask me about it but i purposely avoided that question and say i'm sorry to hear that and take care. He seems unhappy about it and i deleted him. Just be careful ladies scammers have upgraded their skills and languages. Never ever send any money to people you have not met. Be careful on who you talk to on dating apps too, a lot of fake profiles. Handsome and sweet words doesn't means they are nice. Don't be desperate for love and get cheated by them. Be smart!
Received a call on my mobile at 11am claiming to be a personnel from singtel (called id showed a Mobile no.). Reception over the phone was very bad but from what i gathered, he Mentioned something about my house internet, router, high activity, investigation. and then The first question was to confirm whether i was the owner of the home internet. The moment i said i don’t even have a singtel internet line, he hung up.
I received a call this morning on my 'private' handphone number (NUMBER WHICH IS ONLY KNOWN TO A FEW CLOSE RELATIVES AND NO ONE ELSE). Being skeptical, I googled the number and saw it was from Alexandra Hospital. After picking up the call wondering what emergencies there were, the caller (who sounded like an Indian national) told me he was from Singtel and was calling me about internet services that I used as they picked up an error message sent from my router. Over the phone I could hear one other person in the background seemingly talking on the phone as well. Naturally as I don't subscribe to any internet services using that number, I tried to clarify. This time the caller asked me if I was "so-and-so" (a pseudo name I use with my private number). After probing a bit, the caller sensed something was wrong and immediately hung up the phone.
Thanks to all the sharing! The profile is similar, met on cmb. A usa raised singaPorean schooled in ucLa, i was his first friend online. Father died therefore he wanted tO relocate back to sg, being an only child he wants to settle down. Earned a good job at petronas malaysIa. Called me “dear” / “Darling” most of the time and proclaimed that he is chatting very seriously with the intention of marriage. He could not give me details of his studies or where his moTher is. Granted his english is acceptable. Small hiccups but better than Previous Scammers. Funny thing was he Showed me a Contract without me asking for anything. The petronas contract was given to a site engineer jemmy cheng for a project in sArawak And worth millions. Then i realised it was probably a waste of my time talking and sharing real info of myself. Although he trIed to INSINUATE that it was my past ugly experience that prevented me from Opening up. Might have played along a little longer but decided not to.
Received a call at 10am 23/9/19, male voice in Filipino accent claimed to be calling from Singtel, regarding my internet broadband service. He claimed that they detected illegal activity on my network and wanted to check with me about the issue.I instantly doubted them as i'm not a Singtel client, and asked them to repeat back to me my address since they claimed to have my records. Without a word, they hung up.

Today, 23 septeMber, my boyfriend and i went to the uss turnstile to scan our tickets and it turned out that the tickets were fake and were actually edited. I called the seller and he did not pick up eveN aFter numerous texts had been sent. Beware of scammers!
I got calls from 'business department? (looks like internet phone)' at around 6pm on 23/09/19. the first call was not clear, and I hung up, saying 'please text me'. he called me again , saying Michael from Starhub, and told me i won $50k prize at Changi airport promotion. he asked me to turn on video and to show my id card so as that they can send me $50k in 5 min. i wondered for a while and turned on my computer, then, i found similar cases through google search. i hung up the phone immediately. He called me a couple of times, but i didn't respond. when i got calls, the screen showed "business department" (no number), and when turning on video, it showed starhub logo only. luckily, i have my computer nearby, thus i didn't show my Id. If not, i perhaps showed my ID. Scammers are sneaky, so please be vigilant.
I just got a call from this number 96798606 and the lady said that she is from Singtel and that our Singtel Router has some problem and because of which a lot of traffic from malaysia is misusing our Internet. And so she asked me to turn on my laptop. I told her i am at work. So she asked me when would i be home so she may call me back. After i told her that i will myself call Singtel and report them the problem, the call was IMMEDIATELY disconnected. i tried calling and the number could not be reached.
The guy called my mobile number this morning and introduced himself as ben johnson (what a startling name) from singtel team. He told me my home internet has been source of suspicious attacks on singtel's servers and he wanted to investigate it. I told him that i don't have singtel connection and he replied that singtel owns all internet connections in singapore. I was already aware of this kind of scam as my wife also received similar call last month and she disconnected the call. This time the scammer asked my how many lights are blinking in the router. I told him none of them blink as the router is switched off all the time (lol). He then asked me to look at the back of the router and provide the details printed there. I told him to contact my service provider and they can give him all details about my connection. He threatened me that he will disconnect my connection immediately. When I didn't, he hung up.
REceived a call from 'singtel' saying they need to check the modem - how many lights are blinking. they are checking on security, the staff name and staff id was provided to me too. I told them not under singtel. have switched to starhub but they say they not bothered by the connection provider, starhub still part of singtel???? as I am not at home, given them home line to call my husband. my husband answered and requested to enter some command prompt on the laptop. he did not give and told them if required, ask the police to call us again before we do it. the call was then disconnected. checked with both singtel and starhub, there is no such call from their dept. they would not call anyone unless is customer reporting issue to them directly. they have said it probably a scam and we can either report to police or make a call to anti scam.
An Indian accent caller who claims to be from Singtel cybersecurity team. he called to inform me that they have detected people using my home connection. he asked if I want to verify their call through an id from my laptop. they instructed me to turn on my computer and run the command tab.

I actually just in finance problem and just nice the loan text me in the WhatsApp, so I try to text back and ask for any inquiries for the loan of 20k 60mths. And they ask for my particular and bank account, NRIC, work place, income per month and 2 next of kin contact number. After given them the details, they said my loan was approved and will transfer 1k to my account then transfer back to them 1.5k to secure the loan. After transfer they tell me to wait will proceed the loan. Later on they said have to pay insurance fee 1k. I said I dont have 1k to pay and they discount to $750 and I still said dont have enough money. Then they lower down to $500. So I think $500 is ok. Beause they told me that after pay this $500, in 30mins times can meet up to take the cash. After 30mins they said before 8pm will meet me up. But in 7plus they call me again said that that had a meeting said I still have to pay a lawyer fee 5% and a stamp fee 5% total 2k. I get angry and f them up and told them totally no money to pay the fees and don't ask for money again, if u want show me the cash first. Then they die die said discount to 1k then can meet up pass me the cash. I f them up again and said you want come down face to face talk. I said if they think I'm so foolish to trust them. And I also said the 1k I lost never mind let you drink coffee forget it. Then then today 21/9 they still trying to call me and said support them a small loan. It's that funny? And now I decided to report police.

1) HOW IT HAPPENED I got a call on this afternoon (19 sept 2019) at 12:42pm. The call came from local number 98123501, but the call was through viber application, which means the call could have come from some other country also. The person on the other end spoke in a very commanding tone with a forced accent. he said he is from 'central bank of singapore' and they found some irregularities with my bank account. And the accounts will be suspended if I dont act immediately. tHEN i ASKED HIM TO GIVE HIS ORGANISATION NAME. HE TRIED TO BRUSH OFF QUESTION BY SAYING MY BANK ACCOUNTS ARE AT RISK. tHEN i ASKED HIM ONCE AGAIN ABOUT THE EXACT NAME OF HIS ORGANISATION, and he disconnected the phone call. 2) WHEN IT HAPPENED 19 SEPT 2019 AT 12:42PM - call lasted for less than a minute 3) HOW MUCH WAS LOST. nothing was lost.I just was to share the story so that someone else can be prepared for responding to these scammers.
I received a call at 11.15am on 19 sep asking for feedback on the recent technical support on my singtel line.
I saw a post on spf Facebook and i can relate with the scam warning. I am a filipino and This is about my husband who works in singapore. Someone made a facebook account same as his (name &amp; pictures) and then he sent messages to almost all my husband's friends on facebook, including me, asking for our mobile numbers, So i think he knows my husband because he was able to see all my husband's friends on facebook. I have screenshot of the message sent to me and my friend. It gave us an idea that it is a scam because message was on our request on messenger. Because if it was the real account of my husband, it wont be there. I just immediately reported it to Facebook and posted it on my Facebook to warn other people because they thought, it was my husband. I am a filipino but i know that the scammer / fake account is in singapore base on the message construction (usually people in sg use "can" as part of singlish). Good thing, facebook deactivate that fake account and my husband's real Facebook account remained. With this, we immediately changed our passwords on Facebook and my husband's bank account's in singapore.
the person who called claimed he is from singtel and there was a problem with my router being illegally use and i need to go to the computer so he can remove illegally connected users when i told him “i dont have a computer” he hung up.

They called back a minute later, a man with european accent, identified himself as from starhub. He asked if I knew starhub, then repeated my phone number back to me, and told me my number was entered in a lucky draw and I had just one $50,000. I said, No I didn't, and that this is not real and I would report him to the police. Then ask me where I was from I hung up again, blocked his number in VIBER and reported it here.
female caller with an Indian accent called to inform that they are from starhub and they have detected people illegally using my home connection. my ISP is not starhub.

was sourcing out for personal loan online when bumped into www.cmcreditsg.com. website looks legit, with office address , phone number and moneylending license provided. enquired via whatsapp and a representative by the name of kenneth called and was asked to fill up necessary forms to provide personal details inclusive of my nric and cpf statement. within half and hour he called back to inform the loan was approved but was told to do a trial payment first before releasing the $5k loan. (1st flag) the next day after the application, an amount of $550 was being transferred in my account. then instruction given was to make a first payment of $250 then followed by $800 on specific dates. on the day before the first payment, was surprised when kenneth called and requested for $100 as admin fee. (2nd Flag) both admin fee and first payment was transferred via online banking to A same account number. when it comes to second payment, instead of clearing the $800, kenneth requested to transfer $250 to a different account number. (3rd Flag). after making the 3 online transfers, the next following week, realised my account was frozed by the authorities for investigations. Authorities told me to block the number and not contact them. but eventually they started to harass me with different numbers and threatening to hurt my family and neighbours. so peeps, doesn't mean if website is available, everything is legal. Not worth to go through all the trouble.

Was urgent on cash so replied to a quick loan msg wanting to loan 10k. At first they transferred 600, and said to deposit back 800. The extra 200 is for a record of transaction before a loan can be dispersed as I had not loan from their company before. Then few days later they just text and expect u to cash deposit within 15mins. I just did internet transfer and that guy called back screaming and said it must be cash deposit. Asked me to do another deposit asap which I had to borrow from friend urgently and deposited again. Then later sent them the receipt and they called again said they received and will disperse the loan now but must deposit a late payment fee of 800. They will then proceed to REFUND the 800 and 10k loan to me. Sensing something not right, I decided to call the police and was advised to stopped depositing money to their said Accounts as it is a loan scam. Have already made a police report and till now they keeping calling me wanting me to transfer money and.even suggest that I do a favour they transfer 400 to me while they hold the late charge and transfer back 800 in 5 days. Am worried for myself and my family as I had given my NRIC to them. Also worried they keep call my office and family to harass them. Really landed myself in deeper trouble..
1) I was trying to rent out a spare room at rentinsingapore and then this person claiming to be yeo siew lian emailed me about the room's availability. Thinking it was another query, I replied yes. It was then she claimed that she's currently working in Germany and would like to move back to Singapore. She then further claimed that she does not have a phone nor she has any online banking access. Furthermore, she works late and by then the bank will have closed. Hence, she asked me if I have a PayPal and whether can she placed a deposit via paypal. Suspecting it was a scam, I ask her why need to place through paypal? She then forwarded her supposedly 'NRIC' to me. So I went to google her name separately and realised there was a similar scam of the same name happened previously. The scammer would sell the same story and then once you replied yes to the paypal account, the scammer will send you a fake screenshot showing that he or she has deposited money but will need you to send the money in order to activate the dormant account and unblock the fund transfer. However, in actual fact, the scammer didn't transfer any funds at all. 2) it happened 3 days after I first posted my ad on the website. 3) none luckily.

Met this guy called Ryan Heng on CMB (coffee meet bagel) app in may 2019. claims the following: - moved to los angeles from singapore when he was a teen. dad passed away, left with mom who lives in canada. - entrepreneur dealing in tech venture capital, after chatting on whatsapp daily for about two months , he said he won a contract with perenco oil and gas to construct an oil rig in turkey. sent me pic of the contract. - continued to talk on google hangouts while he was on the rig because IT security restrictions did not allow him to bring his mobile phone, so had to use a palmtop. - told me he wanted to visit me in SG after completing the contract, talked about purchasing a property in sg and moving to sg because his mom was singaporean and wanted to move back to SG. - one day in early sep 2019, asked me to do a favour to get 2 $100 ITUNes gift card for him to purchase apps as his anti-virus is outdated. i did not think twice and got it for him. - two days later, he claims one of the control panel on the oil rig was faulty and he needed to rent from a supplier in order to get the job completed before perenco board of directors come for final inspection. he directed me to a dodgy website to help transfer funds to two ukrainian individuals,. transfer did not go through and he asked if i could help with the remaining balance of USD 7k as he only had USD23K with him. Supplier needed USD30K. this was when i realised it was a scam, as the website was very dodgy, did not look like a legitimate bank and google checks showed that the website was only 6 months old. - told him i have no money and cannot help him. confronted him but he did not admit. showed me his US passport to prove his identity which is likely fake. insisted that he will refund me the $200 once he got onshore. - throughout the chats, he shared many selfies of the same guy, most likely obtained from identity theft. plot was very elaborate. - in total, i lost SGD $200. valuable lesson learnt.

I wanted to get a camera and while i was doubtful about an advertisement that I saw online, I contacted the seller to find out more. The description asked me to contact seller on whatsapp.. so i messaged. he then asked me to do transaction directly as fast it will be. and he assured that i pay half.. he will deliver product and i pay the other half.. he said he is trustworthy (i dont know why i believed). next i transferred him 1000 sgd to his maybank account. next day he says he didn't receive the money yet and asked me status. but it was successful my side. so he said his boss was upset and asked me to send full amount (i was stupid to not understand now at least). then i transferred other amount. he said next day morning i will receive the product. next day morning he messaged me that ****** "It's very unfortunate that the Customs Authority still insisted not to release us your pending package in their custody after completing the insurance processes on your package. They further stated that your package has stayed beyond the normal permitted duration at the customs clearing yard and it has already been moved to their customs bonded warehouse terminal and they imposed customs bonded clearance fee of 1000 on your package. NOTE: This payment is also refundable under the law sub section 32:31 of carriage. We will file for the refunds (1000) immediately upon your package delivery and the money will be sent back to you. You are advice not to delay the imposed customs clearance payment, so that your package final delivery can commence as already been re-schedule and in order to confirm you the delivery time." ************* and asked me for another 1000 dollar. i said i already paid full.. customs is his problem. but he kept asking me more money.. which i didn't pay but on top of this... at night he said he sent me a code and that if i give him the code i will receive the product. i didn't receive anything from him. he said it will be from lazada. then i received one from lazada and it said i'm registering as seller on lazada and this code was otp to confirm. i understood that he is scamming and i told him no way i give otp and i am going to police station. he was still trying to act as a good person that he was not scammer. i told i will go to police station and report and he was dont bothered with it. i reported in the police station. I hope no one else would be scammed like this!!!! if this can help at least one person from getting scammed.. i will be thankful to god...

After 2 weeks of chatting, I asked for more photo of him, I googled the information on his Photo and found out the real person is ACTUALLY a Chinese artist live in Sydney. Fortunately I lost nothing and delete him from WhatsApp.
i saw a post in carousell, posted by JOHNBLACK88 (also called ken), on "luxury watch easy instalment plan". on 15th Aug, i responded to it and gave my personal details, including my nric and bank details. then on that day, Ken whatsapp me to inform me that $400 ($120+$280) was transferred to my account and i had to transfer the money back to another bank account to him. I felt very suspicious as i was concerned that my account was used for unlawful activities. so i called him up to ask what was going on and that i was going to make a police report and to ask the bank to transfer back the money. the police officer advised me not to transfer the money back to them, else i will be involved in loanshark activities and all my bank accounts could be frozen! Also to ignore them. However, ken, together with his "boss", harassed me for a few days to transfer the money back to them, despite me telling them, that the bank would reverse the transfer back to them. hence, i blocked the number. They even used facebook to post messages demanding for the money back! they even used another number (+60 17-5631260) to message me, threatening to "whack my family" and burn my "neighnorhood house". eventually the bank reversed the transfer on 22 aug, however, threatening messages were still posted on my facebook to demand the money back! they sounded to be in their early 20s and have Malaysian Chinese accent From this incident, i think it is important to stand firm and to ignore and to block their number. all their threats have been empty talks and very ridiculous with a poor command of English. examples: a) telling me that he will be "coming from Malaysia" to whack me: - I was wondering why must he tell me that he was coming "from Malaysia", to go custom to welcome him? b) to burn my "neighnorhood house" - should be my house right, and so ridiculous, over S$400! i wonder what i can ask him to do with $500! my word of advice: Stand firm! ignore and block their numbers!
Caller claims to be from DHl And informed me that i had sent a parcel CONTAINING illegal substances from Changi T2 DHL to Shanghai .......they said shanghai police had made a report no.008963 back to DHL, they are unable to provide me the dhl airway bill no....... they claim that our call had been recorded through our conversion. the tele-operator (badge no 0969) continue to pass call to her manager (badge no 100314) they even let me know their name....... I only gave my name to them..............next time if anyone received such call just ignore them....
Phone ADVERTISED at a good price at lazada but did not use the lazada platform for payment. communicated via whatsapp and Instead wanted half price up front and the rest at delivery. However after first payment changed his mind and wanted the entire sum before delivery. At this point I realized I'd been scammed and did not send any more money. Seller sent me his (supposed) NRIC as well to "authenticate" his identity.
they gave me a call saying that they were from starhub and that i had won a lucky draw for $50,000 and started asking for my bank account details.

do not believe in any loan offer via sms or media social. i had a painful experience which cause my life in mess now! due to financial issue, i had approached the guy - derek after receive a sms on the loan offer. at first, he said his company will transfer 700 to me but return with 1000 as defer to have account with them. subsequently, in order to get the loan, i need to open file and open account in their company and it cost another 4000. when the money transferred, he told me the account had hit late payment. i need to pay another 2800 to activate the account. lastly he ask me to transfer another 5400 to his company as they want to purchase insurance for me which i decided to cancel the deal. in the end i transferred 5000 as cancellation fee. But he told me i still need to transfer 4000 to cancel the file and account in his company which i refuse to do and start suspect i might get into loan scam. i had keep asking them for the legal document but the person keep telling me they are legal and all is record in system. When i mentioned i will report police and told them they are different from other legal lender. he told me they are different cause they are under tele-marketing and start to voice up to me. In the end, I had called the company which derek quote and the person in charge told me i had get into scam as their company will not loan money thru any apps. i had make a police report on this and also inform my family member to aware if anyone call them and disturb them. lost money is painful, but if family member get hurts from this will be more painful. i had my lesson and hope you all take it as a warning. don't fall into loan scams!

Just received a call from an automated female voice in english 81863387. Voice said "hello, this is a notice from the Singapore high court. you have an important official document that has not yet been received. please go to the Singapore high court as soon as possible. if you want to ask questions please press 6".
Received a call from the number +65 89011975 today. Had missed the call and it went to voice mail. the message was an automated voice recording played saying: "hello, this is a notice from the Singapore high court. you have an important official document that has not yet been received. please go to the Singapore high court as soon as possible. if you want to ask questions please press 6". Seemed like a scam, so didn't respond and proceeded to search online which brought me here. Seems there have been similar experiences by other people from different numbers so putting this here for information.
Received a call claiming to be from Singapore high court and i have to press 6 to speak to a customer service. i pressed and was greeted by a lady called michelle loh. i waited for her to said hello twice and shouted at her to stop this nonsense scam before hanging up. wanted to follow up and call to scold them again but realized that the starhub number is not in use. Will likely make a police report as impersonating Singapore high court is very serious.
Just received a phone call. The voice is machine-generated. It claims I have an important document left at the High court. I hung up as this is completely strange to me. As it is not by a real person, and the machine caller does not sound Singaporean, i noted it is a scam. Please beware of phone calls that begin with automated voice message.
He advertised on whatsapp. Wanted to loan 18k, transferred me $180, ask me to transfer back $500 clear trial loan. Then Later say $1800 to clear 10% as deposit of loan amount.

at 10:48am, 2nd sep 2019, caller with indian accent impersonating singtel admin and tech support. trying to ask for my family and my details. i try asking more questions but they hung up.
Received a call from the number +160959952622. automated voice recording played saying "this is a message from the high court. you have an important document to be submitted. please submit the document at the earliest or press 6 to ask questions". i figured this was a scam as i know the high court wouldn't be calling with an automated voice message, hence reporting. it appears that someone else has also received a similar call, which confirms my suspicion that this is a scam.

It was a match on CMB (coffee meets bageL) app. we chatted first via cmb and then via whatsapp. he shared that he is a singaporean, dad passed away at 12, mum was sweden chinese, passed away 3 years ago. he is a chemical engineer, been away from SG after psle, worked with halliburton for 12 years in texas. decided to free lance so he has time to travel and explore. he has bought a condo at artra in sg (even provided the unit number). he will finish his project on 19 sep and be back in sg on 20 sep. he wants to settle down permanently back in sg. in essence he has provided enough details for me to believe he is real and truthful. Until within 3 weeks of our chat, he mentioned that his machine broke down and needed a replacement. he is at an offshore oil rig. it dept could not help him access his bank account and requested for my help. he claimed he wanted to trust me in this, and he is expecting a first installment. this has crossed the line for me and sounded an alarm within me. i came on this website, and i read about people with similar backgrounds and they seem to like to use oil rig contracts. that confirmed that this is a scam. i'm astonished at how elaborate and real it can be!
This same number called twice and BOTH times I hung up after I heard the "DHL" automated voice message.

Received a SCAM CALL from 9873 8409. They claimed that they are calling from DHL CHINA and that i have mailed out a parcel containing fake passports and is currently detained in china. Initially received an automated voice message saying that i have a parcel. I did not think much of the call because i was indeed expecting a parcel but the voice message spoke too fast so i could not catch the delivery timing. the automated voice message mentioned that if we have further queries, we can click a number. so i did and was re-directed to a supposed 'customer service officer' who then told me about the fake passport story. after i hung up feeling confused, i called DHL singapore to verify who then told me that it is a scam!!

Then i talked to this person called tian zhengyu who then told me, after searching my name in their database, i was involved in an international money laundering scandal, in which the mastermind was called zhang jia bao. He showed me a document signed by pm lee hsieng looong, stating how sg officers and high ranking officials are involved in this money laundering scandal so i cannot go to the sg police. They also showed how sg police managed to give all the power and authority to china police. Worst thing is i could not hang up the call as they said they have china officers in singapore who can detain me and deport me to china for investigation for 45 days. I was really scared and asked how to verify my identity and i gave my nric, passport number, the cards i have and their last 4 digits, how many bank accounts i have and estimated how much money i have. I was not thinking straight and gave all to them, not my bank ac number though. I didnt lose any money as i found out after over 10 hours on the whatsapp call with him, when i decided to tell my friend who told its 1000% a scam. I just hung up and made a police report.
Hi, I had purchased a deal in Carousell from a user called "missjjy". The deal is about "MBS Complimentary Stay 1 Night Only". The deal was quoted for S$200 and I purchased it for the same price. On 14th August, I had a chat with the seller and we both agreed with the deal. I Made an Offer in Carousell. The seller asked me to make a deposit of S$50 to reserve the item. I asked the seller to exchange phone numbers so that we can be more comfortable. The seller mentioned that she is currently overseas and can contact via singapore whatsapp number 9468413?. Alternatively, can contact whatsapp via her work phone +660993799588. I shared my contact details too. Then I transferred the deposit to her OCBC Account (which was shared) and the seller acknowledged the same. Now, we were communicating over whatsapp. The seller reserved the item and shared screenshot with me. Then on 15th August seller got the deal under my name and shared a sms with Ref No blanked out. This convinced me and I had transferred the remaining amount too. The seller has been delaying every day giving some reason or other to share the complete reference number details with me... sometimes saying that it is other mobile which is in hotel... sometimes saying that she requested for an email acknowledgment and will share soon. Few days later, she deleted the item from Carousell instead of marking it sold. From yesterday onwards, she is not responding to any of my communication. Her SG number is also not available. There is no response to whatsapp calls, whatsapp chat and carousell chats

He mentioned that i have SENT a parcel of 8 fake passport overseas and that I need to make a report to the china police. He linked me up to THe china police number and i made a report. He told me that since its a phone call, he would need to let me verify the legitimacy of his police post through online search "Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Chayang BRANCH", in CHINESE (北京市公安局 朝阳分局). I did THAT, and saw in one of their REVIEWS that it was a SCAM. After that he WENT on to prove his identity as a police officer by sending me his police iD. Knowing that the review could be true, I search the net and (to my horror) found similar cases of impersonation SCAMS . After which, I ended the call (with him asking me to go over china to look for him in person if I was so unsure who to TRUST). It was in total an hour worth of call. He tried to ask me how much I am earning indirectly and sounded less keen after knowing that I do not earn that MUCH. Don't be fooled by them
I started chatting with a girl i met on michat whom i thought was very attractive, she told me she was working partt-ime as and was offering massages and additional services at $100 for 2 hours, $200 for the whole night. Of course, dumb old me decided to give her my mobile and meet her at 112 bukit purmei road and someone by the name of 山猪哥 from 红顺堂 called me, thats when He asked me to purchase 500rmb alipay credits. When i i heard this, i was pretty Upset and hung up, but Following that, i started getting texts threatening to find me and my family. Being scared, i made the purchase of the first 500rmb (transferred to axs8886@163.com) alipay credit, And was coerced into doing it another 2 more times (ThEy originally insIsted on me TRANSFER 1200 worth of credits as protection for the girl), but i had not much $$ so i ended up with 2 more subsequent transfers of 500rmb. They called again but this time i was fuRious and i told them off and hung up. Please do not fall for their threats and just walk away from it. once you give in, they use threats and fear to coerce you into making subsequent transfers.
Received an automated voice message informing me that I have a parcel didn’t manage to send out. If want to connect to customer service press 1 etc. Then it transferred me to a guy named, chen kai saying that my parcel to a guy named Wang Wen at China has been confiscated because it contains illegal items.They asked me if the items are mine otherwise please report to the police to exclude myself from the case. Hence, the DHL PERSONNEL transferred me Singapore police who mentioned that my case is to be reported to the china branch police station in order to close the file etc. then i was greeted by this man call “offIcer wang Zhi Gang” from Pudong Branch, shanghai municipal public security bureau. they said they will help me to check on the package and write a statement to Singapore police that i am not the one who sent the parcel. After that i I’ve been accused of using a bAnk account under “china constructEd bank” to do money laundering with this malaysia ministry or something named 逊致才。The 逊致才has been caught by them And he Said this guy said i have been given a Amount of money to sell my Personal information to them. Also The whole process of information taking is done through video call Like how Police officer interroGaTing the Suspects, i have to be in a secluded Room and i shouldn't inform any of the family members. In the end i did not lost any money, just most of my personal information has been given. Feel so dumb for trusting them but they are so real. Please beware
I posted an ad about looking for work from home jobs on gumtree. someone contacted me by introducing himself as "boon" and he is from "rebox sg". he offered $600 weekly for me to post ads on social media and websites. the ad include pictures of apple iphone xr 128gb for the price of sgd 650 and iphone x 256gb for the price of sgd 700. i posted the ad on carousell as instructed. about half an hour later, a carousell user warn me about the scammer. He insisted on me calling the number (boon) using normal line. i tried calling and realise that the number was a deadline. i was able to reach him via whatsapp call and messages. i was lucky that someone reached out before anything happened. i deleted all my ads immediately. i hope there were no money lost by the victims.Editor's Note: The company wrote in to NCPC to clarify that "Boon" wasn't a staff at the company. The scammer impersonated as staff of the company to cheat.
RECEIVED a call from a local handphone number . It was a voice recording message in chinese. "Your OCBC account is suspended due to SUSPICIOUS activity. Please press '9' to continue. It then moved on to a short sentence in English but repeated the Chinese recorded message again.
Received SCAM call from China DHL branch automated service (phone number: 9993 1687), then connected to an actual Chinese speaking phone operator. In Chinese the Operator told me that my phone number was associated with a parcel that contained 8 counterfeit passports, that was sent from Singapore to Chao Yang, Beijing. They took down my Chinese name and my first name. I told them I had nothing to do with this. They told me that if I really had nothing to do with this, I should let the Beijing Seaport Security Authorities know directly. In the meantime, they gave me the airway number of the parcel CL69238080DE, the sender's address "Singapore 160056" as well as the intended recipient name and address: Mr. Fong Zhen, #18 Chao Yang Qu, Meng Wai Da Jie, phone number: +86 13213065371. At this point I was still not sure if it was a scam, so when he asked if he could connect me to the Chinese officials that deal with such parcels, I said ok. He connected immediately to Officer Ling En. He asked me why I was calling and explained that he was the Chinese Sea Port authority dealing with sea freight packages and that my phone number was on a parcel that contain the counterfeit passports. I said yes, DHL informed me and asked me to speak to you, how do I deal with this? He said that this was a very serious issue and that according to Chinese law, I had to physically go to the office in Chao Yang Beijing to do a recorded interview / deposition, explaining that I had nothing to do with this parcel - this was the only way to clear my name. I said that is 100% impossible, as I live in Singapore and that I was not going to fly anywhere to do this. He said it's ok, we can reschedule the deposition timing to Monday, 19 Aug 2019 at 11am and everything can be done on the phone. I asked why they didn't want to have black and white email correspondence? and Officer Ling En said that that is not how they do it in China. Everything will be done over the phone with his superior next Monday and that recording will serve as evidence that I am not involved in this. I said ok and then hung up. I googled the airway bill and it did not turn up on the DHL website; I then googled for "SCAM CHINA DHL" and found out that more than 200 people had received this call as well, where DHL China tells them that their phone number is associated with a rogue parcel containing 8 counterfeit passports. I then knew for sure that it was a scam, and I will not be taking the call on Monday. Worried about the fact that they have my Chinese name and first name in English and also worried that others will face the same scam and give up personal information. Don't be fooled into releasing info over the phone!

I STARTED TO IGNORE HIS MESSAGES AND PHONE CALL. he called my office number several times to look for me and saying that i owe him money but never return. then he sent threatening photo of mine and NRic saying that i cheat his money and make sure i will lose my job. on the same night, i lodged a police report about this loan scam. i also deposited another $400 to his bank account so called to clear the $600 loan and blocked off his number. hope everyone out there beware on this loan scam and dont ever fall into this.

Met a Korean guy( alan feng) on Cmb app. He said he own a mining company in perth and work under GIa. We got into relationship online in march. Was given his bank account to help him on some bank transaction as he is on a cruise exhibition where there is no good wifi. Then he claim that before his final stop in greece, he has to deliver item that he bought onboard to avoid the 100% vat tax. I told him that i do not have the money and he said that all i have to dO is to recieve. So when the parcel got struck at china custom, the diplomat called and ask to pay for the tax. He then say use his acct to transfer the money, which i did. However it will took 10 working days to transfer. So at the same time i also used his acct to transfer to myself. And since i am the one doing the transfer i thought that it was legit. And i pay up the tax on behalf on him thinking that the money will return to me. But the bank website was then down and i am unable to access the web. Then he said that he is coming to singapore and have a valid hotel invoice. And when he touch down sg , he claim that he was held by the sg police custody as he was charged by tiffiany &amp; co (his client) for not able to deliver his project. And he say that his laywer will transfer the money, but i doubt so. A painful lesson for me. Be ware..

I received a call from a local mobile number +659384****(not publishing her number here. Read on), it brought me to an automated voice machine saying its calling from DHL and I have a parcel etc. I hang up straight and immediately did a redial at the same number. A lady picked up and when I said I received a miss call just moments ago, she said she didnt call anyone. So I explained that I was on the line with her number and it's a DHL automated machine and advise her to check with her telecom as it seems her number has been used for DHL spam calls. Looks like "dhl" has upped their game.

I received multiple calls from 68704051 telling me that i have a DHL package awaiting pick up; please press one for more details. tried to speak in English - was told this was only a Chinese helpline so please just speak slowly. operator asked why i was calling - i said i received a call from them, and somehow he was able to look me up by my very common Chinese name (Which i never use). Was told by the scammer that i mailed a package that was stuck at beijing airport. told him not possible - i wasn't even in the country on the day the package was allegedly mailed. was told the package contained a book and 8 bank cards, which is illegal. upon hearing that i wasn't even in the country, scammer said i was probably a victim of identity theft. he told me that i needed to make a report to beijing police to be able to send or receive packages in the future. scammer gave me the date and time that the package was "mailed", as well as the recipient's name and address in beijing. he also wanted me to take down his name and employee number. he then wanted to transfer me to the authorities in beijing to make my police report. i asked if he could give me a number so i could call at a later time, or if i could have someone else who speaks Mandarin better than i do make the report on my behalf. was told this was not possible since i would have to make the report myself. he refused to give me any contact information for the "Beijing authorities", and said his supervisor would transfer my call directly to Beijing if i could stay on the line. i hung up once he put me on hold. Another 2 unknown calls came later but I rejected both.

The caller is an automated machine with a chinese female voice saying in chinese that they are from a china embassy and there is a parcel that is for me. i hung up the phone and did not listen further. i suspect that it might be a scam call requested for money. This is not the first time i received such calls.

I scared so I just follow instructions, using my credit cards to buy almost worth of 4000sgd iTunes card from 711.. Finally I really can't stand on the threatening call, I off my phone and leave the location as soon as possible. I still received unknown call and threatening sms on second day before I turn on block features to block all unknown calls and blacklist sms number with short code, zerui0905.

I get to know this girl from jiojiome. I contacted her through line to get We agreed to meet up and She sent me an postcode (650272). I then arranged to meet her there that night at 11pm. I then contacted her after i reached the location. And she asked for my number THEN A GUY NAMED “林正坤” CALLED ME AND explain that I JUST NEED TO ANSWER SOME SECURITY QUESTIONS TO CONFIRM THAT I WASN'T AFFILIATED WITH THE POLICE and that i will have to walk over to the AXS machine next to the posb atm machine to buy sgd$100 worth of Alipay credits to pay her as she didn't want any cash transactions for the first meeting. So i did buy RMB$500 and keyed in the email address that she provided ( w566599@163.com ) . after paying I was asked to make 3 other payment of sgd$600 security deposit and to make sure i wont harm or nab the girl. Again stupid me, i bought the credits again. He then again told me he needed another 3 receipt for refundable deposit of Sgd$600. And I was able to negotiate AND made a payment for 1 receipt of sgd$600 and also was given a dateline to make payment for the rest of the 2 receipt payment. I have cleared all my savings to pay for all the deposit and I lost my temper with him AND I started hanging up his call and he started to threatened me that if i make any nonsense He would ask his “brothers” to come to my house and harass my family. He then gave me a deadline to make payments. In the end, I went To file a police report online I lost around $2600 to this scam

It was an automated voice message from a lady speaking in Mandarin claiming to be from ICA, saying something relating to my pass/permit. There's a number option to press to connect to another person. The recorded voice message repeated twice and will disconnect if you did not respond. When I tried calling back, i found that it's an invalid number. The phone number used was 89981039. Beware of this call.
I got to know a guy from Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB) and his name is John Cheng Williams. He claimed to be a American, a mixed, father is from Poland, mother is from Singapore, both deceased now. He is a single child, divorced with no kid. He works in Dubai as a freelance rig engineer, will be coming to Singapore in Jul19 to join Sembcorp Marine after his project in dubai ends. he wants to settle permanently in Singapore and settle down with me. he plans to get a condo in orchard rd. he is facing problem with his mudpump machine and needs to order one from china and cargo ship to the rig so that he can complete the project and start new job in singapore. he has problem in accessing his us bank account to pay the china supplier as internet access is restrictive at the rig site. he can do whatsapp call but not able to video call as internet is weak there. He told me he has stopped using the app since knowing me however I saw him deleted our chat a week later. I decided to pay a fee to be the premium member and I am able to see Bagel’s activity. He is still using the app that is why I am confused. I was ignorant of not knowing the existence of sg scam alert website until one day I searched the net for possible scammer traits until I found out this website (more relevant and more real cases) which helped me to find out and TRUTH and THANKFULLY I did not lose anything as I already know his plot. I managed to find 2 similar stories of this person from the cases shared by 2 other persons on ScamAlert. I would have been one of the victim if I did not read the stories above. It hurts though to find out the person I had been chatting so intimately every day is actually a scammer!

I have since blocked him on whatsapp and deleted CMB.

Was browsing through locanto and Attracted to a lady called meng qi offering cheap services. After a few round of chat on line, proceeded to simei. It was pretty coincident of her place to also be near mine. It was a scam tactic as they asked mine First, making it convenient for me. She suggested 7-11 which raised my 1st doubt. I asked for some reason and she says will pick me up, which is unusual. Nonetheless I still went ahead. When I reach, she says her friend will call me and do verification. Ah Kun called and asked me to go axs to transfer thru alipay as the lady cannot take cash transaction due to her student pass. 2nd doubt. While keying in the gmail needed to transfer, there is a big alert on the screen "Do Not send to other email as your pin will be release". Then I stop the transaction and i told Ah Kun I am cancelling as it is unsafe for me. He got angry and shouted. I hang up on him and then received violent video from the meng qi and threatening msg on tracking me down. I proceeded to delete my line account and change to private for my social account and whatsapp.

I informed that I may not move out before september and If She needs the place , we can make some arrangements. SHe agreed to move in September once I vacate. I was contented to have solved that issue easily She asked me the exact address where I stay so that she can ship her luggage to that address. I furnished her with the same. She provided me with her NRIC number S763620?E and asked me to share a payPal account so that she can transfer the deposit. She forgot the online bank details so insisted to use paypal. I requested her to use whatsapp/ messenger/etc so that communication can get easier. However, she denied stating that email is a good way to keep record. before creating paypal account, I somehow happened to google and find out It is a scam. Be wary of such scam! Even though they provided a picture of the i/c, it can be photoshop-ed and may not be theirs!

Vendor advertised Huawei P30 Pro cellphone for sale at SGD500 on lazada website. after some enquiries on the website, the vendor asked to chat on whatsapp. I did so and after further enquiries, i was directed to make direct payment to his account, and not through lazada. ABOUT SIX HOURS after i made the internet funds transfer, he whatsapp me that i need to pay another $395 for tax and insurance to ensure safe delivery to my doorstep as the product is on hold at customs. this will be refunded to me subsequently. i refused as i suspected that i had been scammed. i called POSB to ask if my payment could be reversed but was told to make a police report, which i have made. i checked the lazada website again and this time the misleading advertisement is no longer there.
I received an SMS message stated no late fee charge and $185 monthly for 60 months for a loan of 10k, so i started to enquire about it. After taking my particulars and says need to do a test loan before the 10k loan to be approved. The test loan is to transfer $700 and 5 days after i have to pay 1k and they will return back after the loan is approved. So, on the 5th day, they sent me a message to transfer the $1k loan before it would be approved in 15mins. After I have transferred the $1k, the manager called to inform me that the ‘rules’ have changed and I need to pay an admin fee of about $1.5k first and said the company will be reimbursed upon loan approval. The company kept saying that these ‘fees’ will be returned to me upon loan approval. This is just a scam and there is no ‘loan approval’ at all. They even threatened me! Hope that no one will get scammed by them!
I purchased a mobile phone on Lazada for $300. 1 hour after the transaction, the seller contacted me on whatsapp, he WANTED TO VERIFY MY HOME ADDRESS. then, he/she requested that I cancel my order and instead pay them directly through bank transfer to his/her bank account instead, to get my item delivered faster. when i asked why, they said this was because of their company's regulations. i refused, and they asked for a deposit of $100 and balance to be paid on delivery. I made a report to lazada and an online police report. A police officer called and said that they basically cannot take any action because no money was lost. Be careful everyone! Lazada seller: SG_SHOP010 (FYI- this seller no longer exists!) Mobile: 8439214?

Got to know this guy on okcupid, a dating website. he professes his interest for me and soon took our conversation to Wechat. he says he is a Singaporean but was living in Canada with his mum and planning to come back soon to Singaore as his contract is ending soon. We voice call a couple of times and i even requested to video call, but before i could even ask, he says he dropped his phone and it cracked and he was unable to video call me. Hence he told me he wanted to buy a condo in Queenstown. His boss in Canada was the one who recommanded him the agent. however in order to secure the price which was an initial of $1.5million to $950k, the home owner requested him to put a down payment of $350k. However he claimed his account got blocked by the bank in Canada as he transferred out a large amount of money. he appeared to be be sad and frustrated that he was unable to transfer the rest of the amount out. this morning, he messaged me exclaiming that his boss managed to rain 45k and adding in and 4k, which his mum raised, its now a total of 49k. He then requested me to help him send the money to the owner through my account and at the same time, lending him another 1 k as he was short of it. I blocked him after that. he was probably going to use my bank account as a money mule and at the same time cheat me of 1k.
call received from a person named Sheroff, claiming to be an ICA officer. as i had previous experience of taking to similar case, i said "Sheroff we spoke already, last time you disconnected the call". he was taken back and asked in a weak tone "when".. I said "two months back.. you want to disconnect the call". he just went mute and disconnected immediately.

Received a computerised call from +6568412000 that I had an unclaimed parcel, press key 2 for more information. I did not press any keys. But I called SINGPOST to understand what is that all about and found that the scammer was able to impersonate using this +6568412000. I was told not to provide any further info if that happens again.
At around 10:45 AM received a phone call from +6564385121 . As usual I picked the call and he said Mr. Imran I'm calling from Immigration Check point authority of Singapore (ICA). After that I got to know that this is fraud scam call and I immediately blocked his contact number. Beware of such scam calls!
I met this guy by the name of Michael Shun Lee via coffee meets bagel. He liked my profile first, so I just liked back to see how things goes. He introduced himself as a supervisor at a R&amp;D institutes and also a business entrepreneur. His profile location shows him in Singapore but during the chat, he said he is a Korean but raised in Morphet Northumberland in UK and he is based there. He said that he has been living in UK for 20+ year but his English is kind of weird. We started with in-app Chat, then moved to WhatsApp, chatted almost daily asking each other on our well-being. About 1 week after we chat, he confessed to me and said had bought me gifts. I felt weird but end up still giving him my address. I have no idea what he bought because he said it was a surprised for me. He showed me a picture of the posted parcel. Also told me that he left some money inside to pay for the delivery fee and clearance fee. So, the courier service contacted me to verify the delivery details and alert me to pay a clearance fee of SGD1,000. Later, they informed me that they found money inside in the parcel, USD 11,500. And out of unknown regulation, they need to exchange that money to SGD and wanted to charge me a currency exchange fee of 1.3K. I went to the bank, wanting to remit the money. Luckily, the banker stops me telling me the remittance should NOT be going into a personal account. I informed him and the courier service that I cannot remit the money. Both sides start to get angry with me for being ungrateful! I was totally speechless. I was kind of angry and stop responding. He then tries to act like I break his hearts and stuff. I got a little soft-hearted so tried to add that account given by the courier service as Payee online. This time round, the bank app rejected the swift code they provided. I informed the courier service. No reply. I told him. He asked me to use Western Union. I said it was not convenient to me. Instead, I ask him to remit the money on my behalf. He said no because he had already left the money inside the parcel. From then, I stopped replying him and blocked both contacts. I have this feeling that both him and the courier service are partners in crime. He actually sided the courier service when I told him about the bad attitude they were giving me. Btw, he said that he engaged WORLDWIDE COURIER SERVICE but was not able to provide me a tracking number when I ask for it. Really thankful to the banker and the app. I hope my story will create awareness for others.
Today I had an appointment at ICA for my PR application confirmation. Within 15 mins of completing my appointment with ICA, I received a call from someone who attempted to impersonate as ICA officer. Surprisingly, this scammer knew my name and that I’ve just had an appointment with ICA.. He addressed me by my name and asked me to meet him privately near ICA to discuss some urgent matters. The person said that this call was about my impending deportation. I knew this was a scam call and hung up immediately. Please beware of unknown calls even if they call you by name and do not divulge your personal information at the first instance.

I got the call from an Indian guy with the number 64385128 and he mentioned that he is calling from ICA immigration office. He was asking how long i have been in Singapore and if i have violated anything back in India. Apparently, i am not from India and i have never been there. I hanged up and he called again and even speaking to someone using their language. Then i asked again what is he representing, he never answered back so i told him that he is a scam and he hung up.

Flagrant fake information alleging that Adam Khoo and Straits Times are advocating investing in bitcoins. the link also lead to some foreign sites. Once they improve by having payment gateway in local language, it can turn very dangerous.
Fake tenant alert! Li xiaojie working as a chef in cruise. Foolishly gave my paypal details and contact number to her because she provided her on whatsapp number! Whatsapped her and here are her claims i am stationed on the system now about to get the payment done, i need a kind favor from you and i will be happy if you can sort it out for me i was just about to pay when i received an email from my shipping company, my shipping agent says i will need to pay for the moving before they can ship my items, they charge me $400 sgd for pick up and delivery and payment for pick up will be made to the corporate international headquarters in philippines. The payment is to be made through moneygram money transfer. I will add $400 sgd to my to my rent deposit that i will transfer to your paypal account which you will kindly help me to send the excess $400 sgd to them right from the start, it was somehow fishy because i insisted her to view but she gave excuses that she wanted to secure her room. Once when ive given her my paypal details via whatsapp, she wanted me to pay the mover fee via Moneygram and i told her to do it by herself lol. Now it appears to really be a scam. Have not blocked her on whatsapp yet but maybe soon... If only i have googled her name before wasting my time to engage with her grandma stories!! Landowners, beware of her! Because I’ve given her my paypal details, i decided to close my account to prevent any hacks etc. Her profile pic on whatsapp is exactly the same face as on ic. Do not be fooled

I received a call from +65 82257818, said it was calling from DHL and I have some unclaimed parcel and requested me to press "9" to deal with their customer service officer, After i did so, a Chinese woman asked me is there anything she might help while i said i received a call from their side. then she just mentioned that i might have unclaimed parcel and requested my name for her to check. i did mentioned the surname in Mandarin and name in English. without providing any tracking number details, she said I have unclaimed parcel from China, Shanghai, and asked for time that I was available for them to deliver the parcel. as i said i work from 7am to 7pm, she said she will inform the delivery man to contact me during lunch time (without asking what is my rest time) to discuss the time for delivery. besides, she said their side contacted me for few times before but couldn't reach me, but in fact i never received any emails/messages/calls regarding this issue.
This guy named Albert added me on instagram and introduced himself raised In Cortland united state but born in hongkong taipu. He wanted to befriend me . Within two weeks, he confesses his love for me and wanted to be in relationship. He said he is independent contracted as safety consultant for petrochemical company. After three weeks, he mentioned he got new contract so need to go Mexico for 6 weeks. After this he will come to Singapore to be with me for future plan. During our daily interactions, he sent me his pictures and video. He also calls me via Whatsapp daily. He sounds loving and caring in order to gain my trust. Before leaving for Mexico, he said he wanted to send me a gift. I gave him my address and name. After that i realized he sent me 4 hand bags, a set of jewelry, perfume sets, prada leather Watch and two set of clothes. I was shocked to see these items in the package as they are really expensive stuff and his courier was US1,400. He told me the total value of his gift was worth US$14k . That is crazy right ? I have sensed it is like a scam so i checked The shipping company website and found it normal. Until the day i received whatsapp from sg phone no to informed me to pay $5500 for taxes and clearance. This agent did not give me any name or account. I called this number but it was no longer in use. I informed Albert but he asked me to pay on behalf and claimed back the parcel. Even returned to sender i also need to pay for the clearance . After that, he cut off all contact. I found out that his contact number was also fake. The courier Website : www.routeni?.com is also a fake website. Albert's WhatsApp is no longer active. That makes me strongly believe it is love scam! Luckily, I didn't pay for anything or fall in love with him. Be careful! Now it is possible to get fake us phone nUmber just for WhatsApp. Sending gift in short time after getting know you is also weird, even if the person mentioned that he will eventually visit you. Many fakes daily life photos and video easily get u to trust but better to make videocall first. Anyway ladies, pls do not easily trust stranger blindly and give them any personal details. Use your wisdom or share stories with your friends to fight against love scam. Love DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BLIND.
today Morning around 9:34am, i had a call from +6564385123 representing himself as ICa officer. His English accent was fake and his tone was very rude and annoying. since i did received such call 6 months back where i did share my personal details but this time i just knew it from very beginning that it was a spam call. He addressed me wrongly first. Then with his more STERNNESS in voice tried to frighten me saying i'm calling from ica, where are you at moment work place or home? I replied back saying "home". Then he said in more heavy and angry tone to make me feel like a culprit of something big of which i had no idea! he asked me to come to some distant private place. I repeated my reply that i'm home. And that pissed him and he shouted that i ask you to come to some private place?! than he asked in same insulting tone how long have you been in singapore and all? I replied - first of all the way he was talking was not acceptable and ica would never make a cal in person and even in case he had been calling from ICA, he would have all the details of my stay in singapore along with fin and all details that he had been asking. Now for my safety reasons and against your rude BEHAVIOR in any case i would like to record this call as i strongly feel this is a scam call! and he hung up!!
I was unemployed for 2 months and in need of a cash then a text message with an ad from "JenseN" was sent to me. I was in desperate need, so i whatsapp the number 85799501 with my enquiry. "JenseN" asked for my NRIC and CPF Contribution. The same night, he transfered $400 to me saying "Take 400 clear 600 defer 200 5 day loan" so on the 5th day, i paid $200 (thinking that as long as I pay $200 3 times, it'll add up to $600) but wrong, they want me to transfer $600 to "clear" it. So for that phase, I lost $800. "Jensen" said the admin will call me for my loan. I was in desperate need, so I pushed thru. Upon paying the Defer $200 and Clear $600, the "TMC Financial" ADMIN Whatsapped me saying I need to transfer $550. the exact text message was "$550 (APPROVE CHANGE/AGREMENT CHANGE" so stupid me went to transfer the money. after that he messaged me saying "SISTER WHY U IN 550 ONLY?!" So agreement change is 550 and approve change is 550. that's $1100. I was so stressed as I needed the loan money and this people are asking for more. so I transfered another 550. i even asked him nicely if that was the last payment. he said yes. They keep using voice recording on whatsapp. After that, the "admin" was asking that he will transfer me $6500 (My 5k loan + 1500 - my money that i transfered to them). after that, he messaged me "my boss says need to buy insurance" and that's when I lost it. I told them I won't be paying the "insurance" coz it's $840. I was texting him back with my discontentment and he even offered to pay half of the insurance so I can get my "loan" i lost a total of $1500. I'm going to report them to the police so I started researching and here I am writing this. i just hope i can get my money back.
i received a call from 9045 0147, it was an automated voice (female) speaking in Mandarin at a very fast pace saying something like i have a uncollected parcel and to press 9 to continue. The automated voice message kept repeating itself and telling me to press 9. I just HUNG UP and tried to call back using another phone but is unavailable (unable to go through). i went to google for the number but couldn't find any results until i reach this website and realized that other people also experienced this and that it's a scam. I received this kind of calls before but i hung up immediately. This has been going on for awhile. Do not share your personal information over the phone calls. Always call the organisation's official hotline to verify the legitimacy of the calls if personal information or money is required.
Repeated call within a week received from a different phone no. Already shared about first call earlier. This time, I told them that I will report to police, and they immediately disconnected the calls. During both calls, caller English accent is heavy (not like asian people) and sounds very fake.
I received a phone call from an automated voice message, saying it was from DHL and to press 9 to continue. as i was expecting a package i followed through and a man speaking Mandarin answered. He said that i received the call because i had shipped a package out from Changi airport on 1st july. when i denied doing so, he enquired if anyone had access to my identification documents, and i suspect that if i had not hung up, he would have asked for my I/C number etc. The initial call was from 8802 2038. After it got cut off midway i received a call from the same man from 8400 3773
I visited this site after being fearful and saw several other similiar stories. So, I came across this girl called Xuan on Locanto, offering massage service. added her on wechat. She said she was available and asked me to meet her at people's park. When i reach there, she say a guardian will call me to ensure the safety of her. then the guy call and explain to me first timer need pay through Alipay on AXS. when i declined to, he was nice and say just one time. but then after i made the payment of $150, he brought up the fact that i need to pay a safety deposit which is $1200. initially i thought it was remembered so i say ok, but at this point i was very fatigue from negotiating with him. through this whole time, he was on the phone with me. but when i was about to make the payment, i asked to confirm if it was rmb 1200 right, he grew mad and said its in Sing dollars and threatened to give me hell if I don't pay up. I lied to him that my phone has no batt soon, and i made the run to the nearest police station. i was in fear as i wasn't sure how much inform he has on me. The Police assisted me, told me the best way is don't engage. i blocked his whatsapp call and msg, his mobile calls are all unavailable, i cant block them, i can only turn on flight mode, i deleted the wechat msg to xuan, and he even SMS-ed which i just delete immediate. to be safe, i did a double check on my bank account, turn all my social media acct to private and turn my Whatsapp online status to private as well. i am not hoping to get back the money, i just pray for safety for my family and me and no disturbance from them soon.
Alex befriended me on 2 Mar 2019 On IG to whatsapp. Few days later, he claimed to send me a parcel with important documents , luxury watch, a Dior bag and US$50K Cash. I was given a tracking no. On a fake Global Express Logistic (gel delivery) website. ALex emphasized that he must have the documents and cash when he comes to singapore after his marine Project for His business. I told him I will not accept the luxury gifts. I Only help him to receive the parcel and cash on his behalf. An officer from choice financial Labuan texted me that the parcel and cash were confiscated at Malaysia Customs and needed me to pay various taxes to release. He also sent me a malaysian identity card, Tax receipts to convince me. within 2 weeks, I lost S$8K. Alex claimed he’s a victim too, cheated by agent. It took me 4 months to get over this painful experience.. SCAMMERS Do PREY ON OUR EMOTIONS !!
Got a call from an unknown number 82315811. operated online voice claim that there is a delivery parcel unclaimed and is diverted to a guy who claims he is from DHL. Asked for my name and I gave it to him but I also asked him back how come he does not know my name when its a parcel directed to me. He stated he only just received my name and suddenly the call got disconnected and when I try to call back it was not able to connect. it states the Starhub number I have dialled is presently not in service.
This morning, i got a call saying i have an important file needed to be processed, otherwise my IC will be affected. The man said he is from Chinatown police station. He asked my name, IC, and birthday. He said I sold a UOB card to a woman named meihua wang. I said i don't have UOB card, but only DBS. In the end, i doubted him about his authority. He said you can come to the office. Then he hung up.
I was working when I received an automated call stating (it was from "DHL") that I have an undelivered parcel at changi airport. Funny thing is, I haven't bought anything that requires a delivery. More suspiciously, after connecting to their officer, she only conversed in Chinese, kept asking for my particulars and insisting that I have a parcel (that their "DHL" correspondent never makes a mistake about parcel deliveries). when I requested for an English speaking officer, she hung up on me. :/
I was almost scammed by this guy on Instagram.Recently i met a guy on Instagram, he insisted that i accept his friend request and that i follow him back too. However, he started chatting with me on Instagram and then therefore he ask me for my number. So we brought our chat to Whatsapp. He told me his dad was from Beijing and mum from Singapore. He is currently living and working in UK as an engineer. A few days later, he told me he wants to come Singapore to meet me after he settle his work.A few days passed, he told me he bought me some gifts out of love and will send it to me through courier. He claims that he bought branded shoes and ring for both me and him. As he wants to marry me. He then passed me a tracking number and the website of the courier company.However, out of curiosity i was wondering if this package even existed, so i messaged the courier company. After a few days, when the package was supposed to arrive in Singapore they told me i had to pay $2580 for taxes before they could deliver the parcel to Singapore from Indonesia.I almost fell for it, but luckily i saw other similar stories that were reported as well.
Beware of incoming automated call from “DHL” number- 88242840, press “9” and it will lead you to a Chinese guy asking if you have been trying to send a parcel lately. I hung up knowing its a scam.
On 28 june 2019 around 1030hrs received a call 85514433 and it was an automated voice machine message. "Caller" stated that it was a phone company ( didn't stated company name) and they claimed my phone got unknown signal . required me respond today and follow by request press "0". After pressing "0", call was forwarded to a person with a strong Chinese accent. So, obvious that is a scam
Knew Alex thru Paktor, quickly moved to whatsapp. Alex called me immediately to prove that he was real. Claimed he is offshore rig. Cannot make transactions. asked me to buy equipment which I didn't agree. Then, we chatted further, he said he is running low on data, so he requested usd200 but i bought usd100 amazon gift card. making plans to come see me but then said since it is private off time, company cannot pay for his air ticket, so requested i helped. i told him money is an issue for me and he said do not worry about it and ask me to write to his company as his fiancee. this is when the warning bell rang when he asked me if i can buy the air tickets. so i started to read up more and realised the stories are all the same. haha. so yeah. anyway the original planning was to wait for his contract to finish and come visit me in singapore. then he said he has enough money to retire and no need more contract. this afternoon said he may consider taking up another contract if more work comes along his way. so yeah! scam alert to the max. Moniker: alex lee chang parents from beijing, dad is deceased and mum is running own fashion business.
i got a call from +65-64385126 . the man on the line was talking to me as an ica official and asked me about my whereabouts. When i told them i was outside, he informed me that he is waiting outside my house with a deportation letter. he told me that i was involved in money laundering and asked me for my bank account details. as i was reluctant to give him my details , he started threatening me, saying that the ICA will deport me from Singapore and if i will not co operate with them, i will be put to jail for 3 days. I realized that it was a scam and didn't share my details with them. they already had my name , so not sure from where they get these information. i wanted to share this information, as nobody should be fooled around and lose their valuables in the process. Thanks .
I got a call from +486564385112 from a guy calling himself as iCA officer. he was speaking in a CAUCASIAN accent. He wanted to talk something very personal to me. I asked to identify himself using his IC number. He got angry and cut the call.
Met this guy on Tinder end 2018. Say he's mixed BRITIsh/korean and he's an Entrepreneur. Just signed a big contract. Professed his love for me in a week. HE say he needed some cash for his project and ask me if I can help. Over the course of 6 Months, I have transferred in total about 17k to him. Worst of all, I'm now in trouble with the law because he ask me to receive an amount in my bank account on behalf of his friend. This is a very serious criminal offence. Please be very very careful, people.
I first received a missed call from the number 8184 2120. When i tried to call it back at 09:17, it failed, twice. At 09:24, the number - 9357 3506, called me and I answered. The phone call started off with a voice-automated message in Chinese (telling me that this is the final warning), upon which, prompted me to "Press 9" to speak to a customer officer. A man who greeted me in Chinese, spoke to me and addressed himself as a worker from DHL. I was alarmed when he told me that I had delivered a package on the 10th of June to Guangzhou, and that the package had been held up by them due to illegal materials. As the call continued - he then told me he would transfer me over to the post office, in Guangzhou. A voice-automated message played again. I believed shortly that it was the same guy, only in a slightly different setting. He asked for my name and age. The call went on for about 30 minutes till it got very suspicious when he gave me instructions to add him on WeChat via the ID: SSGTGT1688 and he addressed himself as "Bing Hai Min". I then ended the call, and a number from Guangzhou, then called me 8 times, all of which I did not pick up. +86 (20) 8315 8000
On Facebook I have come across this ad "Brand new apple Wireless Airpods" for SGD 150. listed by the user " Lehcim M Olbap". When contacted, they asked me to Whatsapp on +659083684?. After exchanging messages on whatsapp, they have confirmed this to be genuine and promised me that they don't take your money for nothing blah blah blah .. i have finally transferred the money of 150 SGD to have the item delivered to my home by 1 PM. I even confirmed how is the package delivered , is it by post or will they send some one from their company to delivery. They confirmed they will have someone from the company to deliver. After that, to my horror, I get an email stating the customs official authority at the airport has already inspected and examined your package and they insisted to approve gst and insurance fee but not to commence now until the package gst and insurance fee is cleared... and asked to pay 250 SGD more to another POSB Savings account Account no: 24953258? by now you know that this is a scam and you have been royally cheated. The actual cost of Airpods is 290. Why on earth you will pay $400 for it? So be mindful and be vigilant.
I wanted to buy a new phone online at a cheaper rate from carousell and I saw a post by @tianhui93 (account suspended since) stating S10+ selling for $870 with original receipt. Was later told to contact her via whatsapp which I gave her my contact number. Her contact number is +65 8289 205?. Over Whatsapp, she identified herself as Siti and gave me their 'company' website "www.shopmobile.sg" which I thought was legitimate. After some questions regarding the phone and delivery method, she assured me that the phone will be delivered once payment is done. Therefore, I transferred $870 to the account name "Shop Mobile", POSB, 248-77607-?. After the transfer, she congratulated me for being the 100th buyer and have won a special discount promo to buy any 4 phones and pay half the price. So that's when I asked for a refund as it was obviously a scam already. She even sent me her NRIC to convince me that the deal was real and legitimate.
Met a girl on locanto . 可可. Sweet talker , chatted like a normal person. finally decided to meet at clementi mrt. then she would say she was on the way over to meet me. then asked if its okay for a friend to call me for verification. the next call as others went through would be to go to the nearest AXS machine to buy a 100sgd Alipay card. At this point i was reluctant I bought and gave it to them. Now I expected the issue to just be a scam and just wave my $100 dollars away. But no. Now they're calling me asking for $1200 for her protection fee and she would return to me in cash when meeting me. in case i was a police to catch her. now obviously 1200 is alot and it raised all the flags for me to get the hell out of there. then the girl via Wechat begged me to borrow money from a friend or anything. and knowing that they already took the Alipay money . which they more or less will take on the spot. i just gave up and asked them to keep the money. Then the guy called back and threatened that he knew my phone number and could track me and my family will pay the price. so i just told him straight i don't have any money left. so i tell the girl that i would get the money in a few days. obviously at this point I won't pay . duhhh . Just to stall them. might just consider changing my phone number and be done with these nasty people. yes people don't trust what you see on classified websites. Beware of such scams!
I met a guy on coffee meets bagel app 3 weeks ago, claiming he wants to be friends. We chatted for 3 days on the app and he asked to exchange phone number. He persuaded me to give him my number to add on whatsapp because he on the coffee meet bagels app, the chat will expire in 7 days and he wants to continue to chat with me. He claimed he is from singapore and lives in uk westminster, lost his dad when he was young, and is working as an petroleum engineer in westminster, uk. Via Whatsapp, he showed a lot of love and care, telling me constantly that he wants to marry me, and that his mom wants him to get married. He sends selfies of himself occasionally, and his pet dog jack. He is a real sweet-talker. He claims that he will come to Singapore to meet me. After 3 weeks, he suddenly told me that he was trying to get a very important contract in Marine oilfield, in north sea. He went offline for 2 days. After that, he came back telling me that he got the contract, and is very happy and he believes that he got the contract because of me being in his life. He told me that he bought things for me to celebrate, will send it to me via courier. When i refused, he said he is driving to the courier company and it is a long drive from where he lives. In the end, i gave him my home address. He sent me photos of a luggage of bags, jewellery, iphone, and a secret brown envelope he said containing $20,000 usd. At that point, i realised he is a scammer because, who sends money via post? After 2 days, he sent me photos of Marine Oilfield, which i cannot see him in the photos. He told me that the contact is smooth and that the package will arrive singapore in 2 days as he called up the courier service to hurry up. He sent me a link to the courier service and a tracking no., i did not click on. This morning, I received a Whatsapp message. The message says “your parcel and consignment have arrived here in Singapore and you are required to pay 4,500sgd for duty import and singapore local charge. Mrs. You message me when you are ready to make your payment so that i can send your acct details to make the payment. And 2 continuous Whatsapp phone calls at 08:46am. I blocked the phone number from the courier service. After not replying to the courier and blocking the courier number, the scammer whatsapp me saying “try to settle the payment, so that when they deliver to you, you can take the money i kept inside for you back.” I blocked him after that on whatsapp and phone number.
I received a voice mail stating that i had a DHL package undelivered. For more information on 19 june 19 at around 5.30pm. , I had to press 8 for details. Upon pressing, a chinese guy answered and claims that he only know how to speak chinese and ask me to converse in chinese. He claims that accordingly to his system there was a package undelivered and DHL had been notified. He had asked for my name to RETRIEVE the details and claims that i had sent a package from changi airport to beijing on the 16th june 2019 and currently with beijing authorities due to ILLEGAL items. he suggested that i should contact beijing AUTHORITIES if not it will affect my entrance to china in future. He also offered to call beijing AUTHORITIES and link the phone call for me. i explain that I would need to check and maybe even make a police report if this is true. after which, he just mentioned that he is just conveying this information to me. I mentioned that i would need to check and will call back DHL when necessary.
Received a call claiming to be an officer from ICA named Sherrof. He said he need to discuss something confidential so asked me to be in private. I was asked about my stay period in songapore. I was told that indian Consulate has ordered for my immediate deportation from singapore due to some legal issue back home. I said am 100% sure am not engaged in any illegal activities back home. He restricted me from talking to anyone AROUND and was threatening WITH authority quoting some articles numbers to cooperate in the investigation. He saod i should not disconnect the call or INFORM anyone. He then mentioned about some wrong number filled during immigration. When asked to elaborate that he just explained very vaguely. I said i will inform my HR to look in to this as am not aware of it. He used more authoritative voice claiming to be on a three way CONFERENCE call with some govt agency. I said calmly i will not disclose any personal information over phone so i will come immediately to his office with relevant documents. He just disconnected the call.
I was in need of money at that point in time, I was lured by an ad that was sent to me by WhatsApp. On June 15, I went to inquire on the loan, the person asking for my particular, bank account number billing address and a copy of my ic number. At first, it was like normal information to approve the loan, in the beginning after they have a process they say they have a mini loan for me amount at $400 an in 5 days I need to clear back $600 for activation on the account. I did the transfer on the 5th day. On the 5th day, I was asked to transfer they asked to transfer another $600 for admin fee/ GST and will refund when the loan is approved, yet again, I did a transfer for the admin fee with cash deposit machine. I thought it was alright given that I deposited money directly to the account. But oh boy I was wrong! Creditor claimed that they didn't receive the money and I need to redo one more time which is another $600. So I did make another transfer and you know what they say, I have a penalty of $500 TO CLEAR BEFORE MY LOAN CAN BE APPROVED. Trouble started from this point on as the creditor started making me feel like I was to blame for not doing the whole process correctly. So, I transfer the $500 penalty fee. After paying all this amount, the problem doesn't stop here, the creditor is still asking for more money with a reason that I need to activate my loan again which cost another $700, please be aware not to fall on this situation like me.

It happened on 18 June 2019. I received a call from an individual claiming to be an ICA officer. He said he was calling to question some of VISA details as there were some issues. He started asking for how long I have been staying in Singapore. I sensed that this was a scam and responded that if he was indeed from ICA, he should have my records. He argued sternly saying that this is a questioning and I have to respond as there is a case registered under my name. When I enquired which office was he calling from, he disconnected the call. Learnt do not be scared if you know you have not done anything wrong.Do not share your personal information over the phone without verification. Always call the official number that you find online to authenticate the call.
He added me on Facebook. I briefly looked through his past FB posts and only noticed that he joined FB few years ago but very minimal posts. He kept wanted to move the chat to Whatsapp because he said his job (pilot) can't use FB often. Then we chatted on WhatsApp. I noticed 2 things (1) his FB account deactivated after we switched to WhatsApp (2) his WhatsApp number is a business account. I suspect he was also trying to scam another girl because he 'explained' his FB account got hacked even though I didn't tell/ask Him. He uses a lot of sweet words during chit chat. One day he said he bought a lot of branded stuff for me and asked my address to send to me. I tried not to but still have him my address. I felt uncertain and decided to Google for love scam cases and come across this site which shares the scam stories. I saw got girls being asked for few thousand dollars from the fake delivery company. I texted him to tell him that I was expecting a fake delivery company to contact me. His WhatsApp number is deactivate... Through this experience, fortunately I didn't lose any money but I did lose my personal info to scammers.. Sharing my story so that other girls can also look out each other and prevent tragedy from happening.
I was approached by this taiwanese student called 啊翔 on a dating app, and he asked me to add him on line (AY832). HE OFFERED MASSAGE SERVICES FOR 100sgd/2hours, and was friendly throughout the conversation. When i went to the meeting place (I.e. Axs at hougang central), he said that he would need me to talk to his friend. Shortly after, his friend (坤哥) called to say that as this student was on a student pass, it would not be convenient for cash transactions. Hence, i would need to pay rmb500 FOR the massage services via AXS (Alipay), and subsequently another sgd2,500 worth of alipay as deposit for the safety of this student. I demanded for a cheaper price, but he claimed that this was part of HIS hotel AND UNDERGROUND CASH VAULT regulations, and warned me that HE HAS MY PERSONAL DATA AND THAT if i don't pay up, my family and i will land up in trouble. He ALSO TRIED TO calm me down by guaranteeing that I could retrieve all my money upon meeting the masseur, who would make sure that I would enjoy a high level of service. After doing so, he continued to ask me to withdraw sgd1,500 (and then sgd2,000) as other forms of security deposit, in the form of apple cards. He claimed that his big boss WOULD NEED MORE assurance from a first-timer. He also deliberately let me overhead his conversation with his bosses in an attempt to have more credibility. Upon doing all these, he then asked me for another SGD$3,000 as security for other forms of financial arrangements before he can refund me the cash through my cash. It was then I suggested to stop ALL CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM AND THE STUDENT, despite threats or persuasions from these people.THE MASSEUR CONTINUED TO LINE ME thereafter and asked if I could purchase another SGD$150 worth of Apple card. After that, he would meet me to pass the rest of the cash. He continued to say that he has no intention of lying or scamming me, but this is part of hotel regulations which he cannot go against. He said that he had tried his best to mitigate with his big bosses on his behalf - hence the eventual amount of $150.As I have already resigned to the fact that i could not take back the rest of my money (After contacting the bank and AXS) and that they would demand for more, I rested my case by telling him that I will only do so if I see his face in front of me, and he passed me the rest of the case. He insisted that he would only travel down to see me after I completed the purchase and show him the card via LINE. He has not replied me since i propose such way of meeting.
I wanted to get a mobile via a loan. And I came across this scammer. He asked for our nric and payslips. Then once approve no contract was given. They just say they would transfer the loan of $1300 money to our account and monthly pay $130. But they transfer the $300 in 2 different transaction and don't inform you. Then balance $1000 I had to chase like mad then I got worried I dont want this loan anymore and when I asked for their acct number to return the $300 they hesitated, but they gave eventually. Once the money was transferred I thought everything was settled and they didn't contact us. After a month or so they called from different numbers to threaten and blackmail to say we owe them money and all. Its really stupid of me to Fall into this please never get yourself or anyone into this scam EVER. They will always work at night only. Daytime they won't contact us.
I got a call from above number and he asked me about whereabouts. asked me to go to a secured place. Later, he said my name and nationality. he said my country consulate here in Singapore has issued deportation notice on me. he asked me if i did any crime. later on call got cut and then he again called me and threatened me not to cut call since its ICA call. later he said this call is on recording. after some threats he said i have not entered alien REGISTRATION number in the disembarkation form at the time of entry into Singapore. that very moment i knew its a fake call. i told him its been 6.5 years that i first entered singapore and if my disembarkation form is incorrect then how i got the employment pass. i told him i am hanging up and he said he will get me arrested and soon ICA officer will come my home if i dont talk to him and share more details. i did not care and hung up to call indian consulate and mom to understand genuineness of this call. i googled and saw the sample template of singapore disembarkation form and nowhere it asks to enter alien registration number in it. its a clear case of impersonation and scamming people and trying to get more personal information.
Received a phone call from 64323934. Caller turned out to be a voice-recorded female speaking in Mandarin. The voice recording stated that I have a parcel with DHL at Changi Airport. knowing that this is probably a scam, I hung up without finish listening to the recording.
I found this girl 'MENG QI' IN Locanto. I added her in line and i was quoted 1.5 hrs for $100,4 hrs for $200 and $300 for overnight. I chose 4 hrs and i was told to meet her at clementi mall. I tried to be careful so i kept my credit card and all personnel belonging at home and only brought cash. when i reached clementi mall, i was told by meng qi that a guy will call me to ensure i was no link to police. the guy called me, said to ensure safe transaction, i need to pay the girl through alipay and keep the receipt for the girl, that's how the girl get the pay. i was persuaded and went back home to get the credit card and followed his INSTRUCTIONS to transfer 1000rmb (~$200) to the account axs6544@gmail.com. i message Meng Qi that i finished transferring and the guy called me again, said i need to deposit rmb9000 (one transaction is max to be rmb1000, so need transfer 3 times to ensure my identity. i missed heard what he had said in phone and i deposited only rmb3000. i was so tired because he kept asking for additional fees and he claimed that these money will be refundable. so i did it, and messaged meng qi again. the guy called me, guess what, he asked for medical insurance for the girl to make sure she won't be hurt in the deal (total RMB12000 but this guy 'ah kun' said he helped me to cover half of the fee, so i need to pay rmb6000). i told him i have no more money and he persuade me to borrow form other people. i was quite lost that time as i just wanted my money back, i borrowed $800 from my friend and went for the transaction. thanks god, my credit only could go for one rmb6000 transaction and not enough to go for second transaction. i felt totally hopeless and so called 999 and went to clementi police station to make a report. in the meantime, meng qi (the imaginary girl, who never appeared) sent me video that how people got hurt by them because of cheating them (what? not i'm the one being cheated?). Ah Kun also messaged me he will check THROUGH my contact number and find my working place, hurt my family etc etc. here i just want to say, money never come back to me, and currently i'm safe. don't hope that money is refundable, i hope that my story is pretty clear for you and don't be the next victim. Thanks!

I was supposed to meet a massage therapist i got to know from line at clementi ave 3 blk 451. The deal is $100 for 2 hrs. Well, the story is the same as the rest. I should have read this website before Falling into this scam. Lost $500 to the ‘boss’ known as Ah Kun (he even mentioned he owned Sentosa and the police can't do anything to him). How brazen and arrogant!
Received an SMS on the advertised loans. I asked for more details and scammer requested for personal data such as front and back of my nric, bank account number, cpf Contribution History and 3 next of kin hp numbers. I gave but felt skeptical, and I told the scammer that I need more time to think before Deciding when he told me that he will transfer me $300 and I need to transfer him back $500 and he will return the $200 before loan starts. I did not agree to that and asked for more time to decide. The next day, the scammer transferred $300 to my account without my knowledge. I told him I did not agreed to it and I will return to him. He said to return to him to another bank account which he needed more time to get one due to public holiday. A few days later, he gave me a bank account number for me to transfer back the $300. Once transferred, he told me to transfer another $200 which was not part of the agreement. He said in order to not take up the loan, I need to transfer him$200 which will then be transferred to me. I did not comply and emphasised to him that he did not mention anything about transferring $200 for closing of loan. He then threatened me that he will collect it from my office or neighbours. I did not reply to his message and immediately made a police report. Police recommended me to stop messaging him, change my number and close my bank account. I felt relieved after making the police report and hoping that I will not be threatened in other ways despite them having my personal data. I wasn't so interested to get the loan hence I did not make the decision to transfer my own money to him. But this is a lesson learn for everyone to be wary of such scams.

I GOT to know this lady on Locanto. Lady agreed that i should pay her $100 for 1 HOUR of sex and massage I then proceeded to Sembawang road petrol station and was told by her that she will get a friend to call me to check if i’m a police or whatsnot. So this guy by the name of 啊坤(Ah kun) Told me that Due to me being a First timer and all to protect me and the girl from being scam, That Instead of paying cash, i should buy alipay credits from the axs instead. As i only had cash with me i told him I couldn’t top up axs due to the needs of using a card for payment and then He persuaded me to find a atm or find a fRiend to TranSfer me first and i can pay back later. So after talking awhile and walking around like an idiot to find a deposit machine, I topped up $200 (1000rmb) as agreed, then shortly after he told me to transfer another $1200 as a deposit in case I do something to hurt the girl. I was told that I would get a refund after my session. I was already feeling like it’s a scam when i was told to purchase the alIpay credit but still proceeded to topped that $1200 alipay credits. Then I told the guy on the phone that i don’t have $1200 and even if i do have it on me I won’t be giving it to them and then he started threatening me that he would find me and my family and beat the shit out of us since I "played him out". I know that he can’t do anything so I told him that I would be making a police report. Warning to all male users out there: Please Do not fall prey to such scam. There are scams out there and do not be threatened by these scammers! Don’t make the same mistake i did. Especially those girl in WeChat! 色字头上一把刀！

I recently joined this events GROUP (meetup) which are meant for Singapore-based residents to join. He first sent me a message and then we chatted more. At that time, I thought he is from Singapore. Eventually, he asked me to move to WHATSAPP as he said it will be easier to chat over there. He claimed to be based in New York. Even his MOBILE number is NY-based. (I was thinking why he joined sg events if he is so faraway) He sent his photo WHICH is REALLY NICE. But as we chatted more, I realised he may be a love SCAMMER trying to bait me. Now its about 48 hours after he CONTACTED me.
i found her VIA LOCANO, decided to message her. she suddenly asked if I want to meet and offered her services. Her boss called to ask me some questions, claimed that since this was my first time with her, the payment for the service would be made via Alipay. Request to make $1000RMB (~S$200) and this amount would be reimbursed S$50 when she met me. After I made the transfer, he called me again and told me to pay an additional S$1200 as "protection fees".
I met martin via the app coffee meets bagel (CmB). he started by stressing that because we met online, and thus we should proceed slowly and get to know each other better, there are lots of scammers out there. Thought this was really convincing, so an alert to those who are using the dating apps for the first time. this seems to be the new method used by scammers. For the rest of the story, its pretty standard, he sends love messages early in the morning, and then at night, we chat. then he had to go overseas (that was when Ipressed for a face to face meeting). when he is overseas, he had to put up some money in order to clinch some contracts. he uses overseas numbers (one is in UK, and the other is in US), had some nice pictures taken of himself on business class, deliberately let slip that he has a driver in Singapore where he is in project management. calls to him need to be planned, and a few unexpected calls to him, he never manages to answer. He has a nice accent over the phone. So please do be careful.
I received a call which redirects me to a Chinese speaking caller posing to be from "dhl" . he ask for my name pretending to check for parcels and told me I have a package sent to China and withheld by china authorities. I hung up the call.
This scam sounded so elaborate that i don't even know if this is for real, or is a scam. but i thought i share this story quickly to prevent anyone else to get scammed. I met this person shan through the dating app coffee meets bagel. He runs an engineering company, is an Australian but claimed to be in Singapore with contracts from Petrobras and Sinopec He started our conversation slamming scammers, and tell potential scammers not to contact him if one is a scammer. that was certainly very convincing as i had met scammers online before. he started talking for a week or so, then claimed that he had to travel overseas, to an off-shore oil refining location, where internet connectivity is INTERMITTENT. Then when he was overseas, he needed to buy some equipment. and actually shared his on-line banking details, so that i could help him purchase his equipment. then the internet bank has a limit on the amount transferred, and that's when he asked for an infusion of funds, into his personal account, to help him pay for this purchase. so i could see that he had a few million dollars in his account. This scam is so elaborate as ELLSCORPS CAPITAL/ALTEC EQUIPMENTS/INTEGRITY ENERGY SOLUTIONS all have legitimate websites, so upon first checking, they appear to be legit. however, upon doing a second layer of checks, i drew a blank. eg: ellscrops capital claimed to be a subsidiary of citicorp USA, but checks drew nothing. the companies mentioned also have photos/addresses etc. Altec equipments also am based in the US, and their website shows proper addresses, contact numbers etc. PLEASE ALL BE CAREFUL!
This IG: Hyun_jun_smith45 start to Follow me ig on 27 April 2019. Then he start to PM me on the very same day. Treating him as an online friend, we start to chat. He introduced himself as MR Hyun , Dob 15 may 1981 , working in London. He Migrates to London when he is small during Korea war with his parents. Parents move back to Korea for good. To make it short, I will summaries what is my encounter with him. 1) birthday Round the corner will ask for a birthday gift as a blessing to him. I offer to buy him when he comes to Singapore but he will say a lot of the meaning of giving a gift and not to trouble me just want me to buy him US$300 worth of Itunes card. I rejected him as it is too much to give to a person who I never meet. Then he slowly down the amount to USD$100 but i still rejected. Soon, he asked me for favour to help him buy then he will return me back when he come to singapore. Of course, I acted blur and forget about It. 2) plan to come to Singapore to meet me. Due to his work nature , cannot let his company know where is his whereabouts, he wanted me to book his hotel stay and receive his luggage with a large amount of cash inside( USd $34500)on Behalf of him. At first, I rejected the idea, He will use all means to convince you to go along with his idea. Keep giving you the assurance everything will be fine as the courier company he used is safe and trusted. In the end I accept his idea, but stressed that I would not be responsible for what happened to his luggage. In the end he sent his luggage and later sent me the tracking number with the courier company website. After sending he wanted me to contact the courier company to track Where is the luggage..... to make it short the courier want me to pay SgD$2580 for tax clear and overweight as the item is now transit in Indonesia. When i told him about it he kept wanted me to pay on behalf of him. I rejected the idea cos it didn't make sence if the item is transit in another country there is no need to pay clearance tax( Double confirm with my rElative who is in logistics line). In the end he blocked me from his IG when I messaged him that I realised that he's a scammer. I hope whoever see this post will be more careful with guys/gals who know online. Always have a clear head especially when the other person started to shower you with nice and positive words very quickly.
I matched a girl name 张雯 on Tinder, and she told me to switch to LINE. She told me she's working for sexual service at $100 for 2 hours. when I reached the area she instructed me to, she asked me for my phone number and I gave her. She told me that her friend will call me to confirm that I had reached. afterwards, I was contacted by a Chinese guy with unknown caller number and told me that I am a first time customer and is unable to pay by cash. So I was instructed to move to a nearest axs machine to purchase $100 worth of Alipay purchase card with his given email address. he told me that as long as the Alipay purchase card receipt is with me, the money will not be received by him (which is a lie). after doing so, he told me to purchase another $600 Alipay purchase card as a deposit and told me that it will be refunded back after the service is over. I felt that this is getting too much so I decided to reject him and forfeit that $100. But the man kept persuading me with the reasoning that as long as the Alipay purchase card receipt is with me, the money will not be received by him (which is a lie). After 30min of persuading and NEGOTIATING, I decided to stop talking to him and ignore him. suddenly, he became enraged and threatened me that he had my phone number and my name, he was able to track my location and find out where I live and slaughter my whole family. i immediately hang up his call but he keep calling me, but i rejected all his call. Suddenly, he sennt me threatening message that he would track my whole family down and slaughter my whole family. The girl 张雯 also send me threatening photos and videos of dead people being killed by him. afterwards, i immediately head to the nearest police station and report the whole situation. As I went back to check with the Alipay purchase card receipt, the Alipay customer service told me that the $100 Alipay purchase card had already been withdrawn and is unable to be refunded.
Call claim from DHL - ask to press 9 Hung up immediately upon hearing heavy Chinese accent
I received a popup page that led me to a scam website. The website misused SingPost brand and claimed that I've won a lucky draw. They asked me a few questions to win a Galaxy Samsung Galaxy 10+. It's obviously a scam site!
I received a call claiming to be DHL to track my parcel, and said to press '9' to track. I did so, then i was redirected to a guy. he asked for my parcel number, but he did not reconfirm with me the number if it was correct. the moment I finished saying the number, he told me that he could not check it, so he asked for my name, so I gave. he then asked if i was born in xxxx, which was true (in my head), but i asked if he could repeat what he said to me, he just hung up instead. he never called back again.
Got a call from 95624554 and 91144928, saying my phone number is unusual or in trouble kinda thing in a female PRC Robo-voice and I immediately hung up the calls. I guess there will be more to come. Please block these calls and do not respond to them.
I downloaded this dating app Coffee meets bagel (CMB) and like one guy called “Edward Calonzon Jiang. We exchanged phone numbers. He is staying in UK, we chatted for a month through WhatsApp and developed feelings and relationship and become his fiancée. His story to me was he is an orphan as his parents died in a plane crash in Indonesia. His parents were Indonesians. Before they passed away, they owned a property in Indonesia and one in Singapore. He claimed that he wanted to come and meet me but first have to go Indonesia to sell his property there. In Indonesia, his property in Jakarta has tax imposed by Government and needed to pay about S$12,000. I was tricked by him to take up loans from banks and licensed moneylenders to help him. I have been transferring money to a close friend of his in Kenya via online transfers or Western Union.Then he wanted to transfer money to me from his Barclay account to my SG account via online transfer so that I can pay off the loan that I got for him. But since his Barclay account has been inactive for some time, we needed to pay another $13K to have it “serviced” for it to be usable again. It has been almost a month plus and when I realised that he is not coming to Singapore, I realised that I have been scammed. Now, I am left with a mountain of debts – from banks and moneylenders.
I received a fax from a Keith Oliver stating that I was eligible to receive the death benefit payout of his late client. According to him, his late client had died without a surviving relative. Due to the both of sharing the same last name and nationality, the life insurance policy of $7M+ can be legally paid to me. He also mentioned that if no beneficiary is presented by the end of May 2019, then the policy will be cancelled. This sounded too good to be true!I was suspicious and found that the firm Peters and Peter LLP is often used by criminals as part of inheritance scams:www.petersandpeters.com/scam-emails! Also, the e-mail provided in the fax https://petersandpetersllp.com isn’t even their real website!So glad that I verified it myself before I could fall for the scam!
I transferred a total of $400. I was so angry when she asked to transfer again for third time for another $150 in order to meet her. I blocked her after that.
I got this kidnap scam sms. It was obvious it was a scam because I'm 16 and have no children. THe sms is as follows "I KIDNAPPED YOUR DAUGHTER/SON , CALL ME NOW BEFORE I KILL HER. DON'T TRY ME.

i found her telegram ID on Tinder and because she was so pretty, decided to message her. A few days later, she suddenly asked if I want to meet and offered her services. and because she was in need of money. Her boss called to ask me some questions, claimed that since this was my first time with her, the payment for the service would be made via Alipay. Request to make $1000RMB (~S$200) and this amount would be reimbursed S$50 when she met me. After I made the transfer, he called me again via LINE and told me to pay an additional S$800 as "protection fees". I said I didn't have so much, I only could pay S$400. He said to pay, which I did. After that he called me and said that his boss said I had to pay the whole amount of S$800. While suspecting something was amiss, I proceeded to pay as well. Then came in another request to pay another $1,200 as "Assurance Fee" to ensure that I am not the Police. When I told him that there is no way I am going to pay that amount, he asked me to go borrow money. I lost a total of $1,200 to this Credit-for-Sex scam.

This guy named Fabio Leong added my mom on Facebook Then fb chat my mom that his mother passed away 5 years ago. So out of empathy, my mom gave him her number. He said he is looking for motherly care/love. Something went wrong when he send a picture of branded bag and also mentioned that he would courier money to my mom in a brown envelope! Good try ya. My mom felt something fishy and texted me. After reading all the forwarded message from my Mom, I checked scam alert sg to learn how to deal with the situation. Oh, he mentioned that my mom have to pay for the tax clearance in order to get the parcel. Please raise this story to your parents. Do not fall into scammed story. Blacklist this +1 (512) 590-4935
I had responded to a message on an app called letgo (sorta like gumtree or carousell); a buyer was keen to purchase a branded bag i had listed and had told me to contact her via WhatsApp. The conversation was normal and she was not too fussy about the price nor condition of the bag, but did appear to be rather impatient. she had claimed that the bag was a gift to her friend's daughter residing in bukit merah and had wanted to pay for the item and arrange for shipping quickly. Then claiming that she was in Canada at the moment on a business trip and working (i wondered why to her the time difference did not seem to matter), she then opted to pay via a bank transfer for she did not enrol herself for paylah or paynow (still nothing fishy here, just a matter of tech adoption rate). Asked for my name, bank account number, bank name and get this, email address which i thought was a rather strange detail to ask for, for an online bank transfer, I have dealt with many buyers and none of them had asked for my email address before except those that had involved paypal. Spidey senses tingling I politely declined revealing my email address and told her that my bank details should suffice for the transfer. and this was where hell broke loose. she immediately turned hostile and told me not to tell her what should be done. reprimanded me for delaying the transfer and mailing, wasting her precious time while working and demanded that an email address be given. asked if i could read and that i should listen to her. her friend's daughter had to receive the bag in 2 days time and the bag had to be sent straight away. I called the deal off on the basis that i was not comfortable dealing with her. also advised her to learn some manners. at the same time i told her that i could read and write very well. and ended with a thank you. because class and manners always first. Beware the "Canadian" bag buyer. her name was Aung and she had a badly cropped photo of a hand on a Siamese cat which appeared to have been cropped from a screenshot of a screenshot.
I received a phone call from someone claiming to be from IRAS. He claimed that after a recent audit, they found I have paid an excess of $243 for my taxes. They would like to do a refund through my card. When i asked what information was required, he said he would need my debit card number and i have to stay on the line with him. I cut the call after that.
Got to know him vIa dating app - happn. He goes by the name Captain Gary Loh, a regular in the Airforce and his camp is Murai camp. It was hard to sense that he's a scammer as he used the information that he is working for Mindef and the UN peace maker And it happened in April. I have lost abt $8000. And I reckon that they operate in a group.
Got to know this girl called Mei Chi on MiChat. Arranged to meet at 763 Jurong West. Arrive at the location and was told that a chap (Koh) would call. I was asked to transfer $100 for service.

I was asked to make several payments, totalling to $3,000. P/S: Mei Chi will keep calling you and persuade to pay. Mei Chi: awy998@qq.com

I texted him and asked him about the place. He sent me a form to fill up and i filled up. He then sent me a long message to transfer money to him before i can get them key and documents. He even send me his ID to make me believe he is real. I told him that I wanted to view the room first for safety reason but he refused and got very angry and even scolded me for making that request. Then I saw a story shared by someone on ScamAlert with the same pictures I got from him. I quickly blocked his contact and reported him.
Added me MiChat, asked to add Line as well. Chatted for a while, lady claimed to be a student, asked me if wanted service. Sent me address to 168 punggol field.

The DHL scam is back! Received a call that started off with an automated voice message in Mandarin, informing me that I have a parcel from DHL. I was asked to press '9" to speak to an operator. Hung up the call as I knew it was a scam. Call came from this number which might be a spoofed number: 90815655
I received an unsolicited call from a call at HP Number: 95982086 asking me whether I would be interested in trading on a platform which guarantees earnings via an international broker using an online mathematical algorithms.

Ok so i got to know this girl on Locanto. I contacted her through LINE for more info. We agreed on $100 for 90mins of her service. She sent me an address ( choa chu kang avenue 4 block 305 ). I then arranged to meet her there that night at 11pm. I then contacted her after i reached the location. She called me through LINE and told me that she is a student and wont have any work pass or permit and i will have to walk over to the opposite block AXS machine to buy $100 worth of Alipay credits to pay her as she didn't want any cash transactions for the first meeting. So i did buy RMB$500 and keyed in the email address that she provided ( axs865@gMail.com ) . After which she told me that her friend would contact me and i just need to answer some security questions to confirm that i wasn't affiliated with the police. Then a guy named “林正坤” called me and ask me for $800 security deposit and send a photo of my I/C front back to make sure I wasn't affiliated with the Police. He then called me again and asked for another $800 security deposit to make sure i wont harm or nab the girl. I managed to negotiate to $600. Again stupid me, i bought the credits again. He then again told me there was another “hotel deposit” $800 and it is non negotiable. I couldn't believe it but stupid me i did buy the $800 worth Of alipay credits which was RMB$4000. He called me again and told me he needed another $2000 refundable deposit as their company account can only transfer at least $4000. I have cleared all my savings and even had to borrow money from friends and family to pay for the deposits. I have no way that i can Buy $2000 worth of alipay credits anymore. I lost my temper with him and he threatened me that if i didnt pay the $2000 refund deposit. He would ask his “brothers” to come to my house and harass my family. He then gave me a deadline to make payments. In the end, I went to file a police report. I lost around $2100 to this scam.
Handsome looking Korean guy added and followed me on Instagram. He claimed he lost his parents when he was 5 years old. He mentioned he was originally Singaporean-born, and Mum was Korean. So he shared that he misses Singapore and wanted to get a Singapore girlfriend/wife. Smart approach since he is trying to get the girl to think that he is serious and legit. I actually doubted him twice as a scammer. But he has this "never say die" attitude. I doubted him once, first time stalking his facebook and found out that he uses an indian name on fb. Then, he convinced me that he is not a scammer by messaging me concurrently on both Instagram and Facebook. Much effort was in placed. We begun our conversation on WhatsApp. He always love to call me the following names, such as; "honey, my love, sweetheart, baby" and always says "i love you more". Pretty good at addressing my security concerns. And clearing off doubts with his good and proficient English. He claimed to be working as a lab scientist, team lead, in an oil &amp; gas company in UK, Edinburgh, earning 7500 pounds. 2nd time i noticed he was a scammer when he keeps saying that he wants to send me presents, and just nice it was my birthday month. I rejected and labelled him a scammer again. I even deleted his whatsapp and unfollowed his instagram. Again, he called and I was taken in by his assurance and sweet talk, saying that he has forgiven me and giving me one last chance, and i shouldn't misbehave. We have texted for 3 weeks since. Last action, he told me his company wants to make middle man profit on some chemical projects and will stopover Malaysia for 2-3 days. So he will come by singapore, we even discussed about tourist attractions and stuff. But the sad thing is i asked for his flight details from London to Malaysia, he did not produce. He also doesn't initiate video calls with me, but rather more on whatsapp voice calls. I've been monitoring his follower and following list in instagram. It is always changing, but he claimed he did not message other girls. His whatsapp number was a uk number indeed, but no profile pic. I suspect several people or users is using the same number. Lastly, he even asked for money when he is in msia, claiming that bank couldn't allow him to process the international cheque. He got desperate since, not making efforts in sweet talking, but aggressively making you guilty about not trusting his love that he wants to earn more for our future. Texting non-stop about when i'm transferring him the money. This just happened today. Thank god i was strong hearted and nothing happened cos i did not want to pay a single cent. Just naive that i thought he might be coming, i prepared a small present but not costly. He is really good looking and knows how to tackle ur questions. High level of maturity displayed in this scammer.
I know this guy David Ching from coffee Meets Bagel app. He said got architect company at UK. Everyday he send u sweet message and concern u with sweet talk. His company was not found from internet.

I reported to Coffee Meets Bagel app. Lucky I didn't lost money to him.

I received a message from “SingPost” saying i have win a prize draw and a link was provided to claim the draw. Once inside, you are told to give 1 usd to claim an iphone. After giving USD$1 usd using my credit card, i received a monthly SUBSCRIPTION of USD$85 UNKNOWINGLY FOR A GAMING SERVICE. I only realised it 4 months later.Upon checking with the Merchant, i was told that the SUBSCRIPTION was activated due to a term and condition stated in the link they provided..I checked the link and indeed the term and condition states that it will charge me a subscription FEE of 85 usd after 3 days if i didn't cancel the SUBSCRIPTION.I told the merchant that I didn't notice it as it was one of the terms stated in the terms and conditions webpage. The merchant did however refund me 2 months after getting 2 months of subscription, I asked the merchant to refund me the other 2 months of subscription, and if they don’t I will raise a dispute with the bank. However, I only got back one month of subscription. I checked with the bank but because I did agree to the terms and conditions, they couldn’t do anything unless the merchant refund me the money. Please read the terms and conditions of anything that you sign up for and if an offer sounds too good, then be wary as it may come with a HUGE catch that you are not aware of.
I was browsing the site: http://imaginationstuf?.network.The site misused the Minister Heng Swee Keat’s name and claimed “supported” bitcoins investment. I then opened a trading account via the link https://bitcoi?s-e?a.com (company named F?leader) and deposited usd500. Via credit card payment. I received an email saying I have to send a copy of my credit card. This is when I became suspicious and i logged in to withdraw my money. The trading portal did not allow me to do so, and said i needed to complete verification first. So, I spoke to the customer service of F?leader. Called IVA Atevens at 31386869 as listed in their site https://www.f?leader.com/contact-us/, and asked her to cancel my transaction and return my money. I also called my credit card bank UOB and asked them to freeze my card and also apply to dishonour the merchant for my payment. They asked me to register a police complaint.

Met this girl 甜甜 on FB, quite cute so added her on social apps called 'line'. She asked where I did I stay, and then she said that she stayed nearby. I "hired" her but when she told me that I someone would call me to "verify" my identity, I felt that something was amiss. When I finally received a man's call instructing me to buy gift cards worth $200 from 7-11, it confirmed my fear. I hung up eventually although the man threatened me not to end the call.
I received a call at 9:31am on 17 May 2019 from the number 92831839.

That person add me in FB and we started chatting on 8th May, he claimed that he's a Singaporean and currently working in NYC, one day he said he that bought me a gift as he also bought her mother a gift for mother's day. After that, 2 days courier service message (fake) said that i need to pay S$3,500 for postage and taxes fee as the parcel is 20kg. I messaged scammer regarding the situation and asked the scammer why I needed to pay, he said that don't worry just pay first because inside parcel he put some money for me as he knows that need to pay that large amount of money (as in like I no need to pay that money). The next day, I paid the money through cash deposit to a unknown guy. Then, on the same day I received a message from courier service ( fake ) that i needed to pay $10,500 for penalty as Malaysia customs scanned inside the parcel and noted that it contained a large amount of money. As it was illegal under the Malaysian law, he said that they are afraid that it's an act of money laundering. I called the scammer (is like Indian voice) again and told him regarding the situation and told him that i'm not going to pay for $10,500. Then, he said that I had to put everything inside and if I don't help him his life would be the end. I told him that to borrow money from friends to pay for it.
This guy actually requested to follow me on IG. I accepted the request. Almost immediately, I started to receive his text on 1 April 2019. He expressed interests in finding a life-partner and we communicated via WhatsApp. He claimed to be an American-born Chinese staying in the States. His father is a Singaporean, while mother an American. He claimed to be A PHD HOLDER but many spelling errors. He’s a project supervisor in the oil and gas industry. His wife passed away 2 years ago due to an accident. His mother is very ill and he prays for her survival. He’s good in manipulating feelings. He will always portray himself to be very reliable and nice. He proclaimed his love for me and affectionately although we have never met. He called me once and there was a strong accent that wasn’t American. When I requested for his pictures, he made many excuses not to send When he finally did, it was obviously not his own pics. After 2 weeks, he asked me to go into a business with him. It carried on until a month later when he claimed that he bought me many things and would be sending the items to me in Singapore. I rejected the idea at first but after his persistent requests, I relented. He didn’t tell me about the fees involved until I questioned him. He then became very frustrated and accused me of stressing him out. He told me not to worry as the courier company he went to was very reliable and he had used it before. However, the company doesn’t even exist. When I found out the proper procedures, I end off the relationship with him. The courier company he claimed to use is “Demont Courier Service”.
I got to know a guy named ‘Tag Brown Chang’ from coffee meets bagel in February 2019. He claimed to be half Singaporean and half Canadian, grew up in Singapore and went on to study engineering at NUS. He claims to have lost both parents and have uncles and aunts residing in Jurong east, hougang, yishun. He owns a company that provides pipeline maintenance services to oil and gas companies such as marathon petroleum Corporation from the USA. He is currently on short-term contract work in Indonesia and typically returns to Singapore almost every quarter to visit his son in Malaysia in Malacca. He claims to be a divorcee, ex-wife is living in Malaysia with the son. What is highly suspicious about him is the immediate confession of love and commitment to a serious relationship within A few days of short texting. I became suspicious and googled for scams under his name and found a scam alert published on 28 Dec 2018 where a John Chang brown was mentioned as a scammer. And also another report in April 2019 wIth the same name tag Brown Chang was mentioned. He supposed to come back to Sg in may 2019 but he said he had trouble with his pipe shipment. The same story as on 28 Dec 2018 reported. He asked my help to email to his piping company (Watson automation system) which I did. Then His items not delivered and he said he could not be online due to bad weather and internet problem. He gave me his bank account pin to log in and i saw he had about $283k++ amount in his bank to make payment to the Piping company. But there was error cos the bank located my ip location address not the same as his. So the bank claimed to block his bank acct. In order to reactivate his bank acct, he has to pay $7k which he asked from me. This immediately raised alarm bells. I told him No. Glad that I searched for clues before it went too far!
Received an automated voice call, in a heavy Chinese PRC accent. Message went like this: This is DHL, you have an incoming delivery, press 9 to continue. I realised that it sounded like an impersonation scam, I immediately hung up the call. Nothing was lost except for my time.

Identical to scam listed on this forum on 23 April where victim lost phone and $30 courier charge. Scammer responded to Gumtree advert for iPhone, saying he needed to deal on WhatsApp. He said he needed to buy a phone urgently for his daughter's birthday the next day, and as he is working offshore he can only do via bank transfer and he would add $50 for me to pay the courier. I gave him my bank details and address. He sent screenshots of the supposed transfer via Bank of America , but I said that I would only send the phone when the money is in my account. At this point his manner became very hostile and abusive saying he has all my details and he will get me, repeatedly sayingthat I would die soon. Having looked at the other postings here can see that the same person / syndicate has already made many EFFORTS to scam other people. Below are screenshots from the fake Bank of America transfers, they use different phone numbers, but story always the same that they need to buy urgent gift for daughter or relative and it needs to be sent immediately. Please be aware.
Happened at Yishun Ave 5 blk 102. Met this girl online on and booked her service after she got my number. I got this call from an unknown number asking me to purchase $100 iTunes card for him. Then, got another call to transfer $1200 for her "protection". After sending him the money, I was asked to send $1,800. This was when I realised I got scammed and filed a police report. I didn't reply or answer their calls and they threatened to hunt me down. Don't be threatened by their empty threats as these scammers are not located in Singapore. Threats are used to make you pay!
I saw the posting on carousel offering iphone xs installment plan. Their rates is cheaper than the rest. I was so tempted to take up. So when i watapps the number provided they will ask for ur nric, cpf statement, bank account number, next of kin contact, office number. Saying they will need to verify the details 1st to see the installment plan approve anot. By nite he show u the cash deposit receipt saying that money is for trial loan see u can promptly make payment. So i ended up making 3 time 150 transfer to them to 2 different account weekly. When i saw someone post a, comment on the same carousel page is a scam i msg back the number im not taking up the loan. They started to threaten will call and ask ur famiky pay for u, u will LOST ur job etc. Hence i make a police report. Pls don fall into these type IPHONE/samsung installment plan. Be sure to verify their genuine business. Or if they say they have licensed do check their licence number on tje official website. Im stupid enough To i Gave them the account number. Shld not do that in fact. Once they credit the cash u will fall into the trap without even signing on any contract or terms and condition.

Caller from "Inland Revenue" turned out to be a scammer I received a call from +6563567755. A man claimed to be from inland revenue authority (with an indian accent) said i am entitled to tax refund of $900+. I IMMEDIATELY identified that this is a scam call. he asked my credit card number.I hung up the call thereafter.
I got connected to this via an app for some days. the day we finally planned to meet up, he urgently needed to catch his flight back to United States due to emergency call back for his promotion interview. 2 days later, he contacted me saying he successfully got promoted, and he wanted to share his happiness with me by sending some gifts. he wanted to know my size for clothing and shoes. an I gave him the information. next day, he told he bought some clothes, and he wanted to send them to my home address. and I gave him the information yet again. next day, he mentioned he has arranged a parcel shipment with express delivery. he mentioned it would cost some money for the deliveries, and he inserted USD$1,800 to refund the custom clearance. I was online on live, so i immediately replied don't send it if he had arranged for such a big parcel to be sent to me. A few days later, a guy, express delivery service contacted through whatsapp informing me that the parcel contained high value item and put on-hold for custom clearance. It cost S$3,500 to clear the customs. I asked for the shipping invoice and delivery note to understand what item it contained, however the delivery guy said no access such documents as the parcel has been hold at customs. I immediately contacted the shipper (the guy contacted through online), to understand the details of parcel, and he mentioned some apple devices, clothes, shoes, watches and necklaces. I asked why this online friend how come he sent such high valued item to me since we have not met each other at all, then he said he liked me. Both the shipper and delivery guy kept pushing me to proceed the payment to avoid further delay of delivery. And both of them said there was no way to reject the parcel receipt. again i asked the shipper why he pushed me so strongly to receive the parcel as I don't really understand the importance of the delivery made on the same day or next day. Anyway, I trusted them and arranged a bank transfer of sgd3,500 to the bank account which they said finance team for them. the bank details i transferred the money to: bank : posb account : 056-45084-? account holder : ng hwe? chen? *** prior to bank transfer, i contacted posb (1-800 111 111) to confirm if this bank account is related to scam, however the telephone operator says they cannot share personal information *** alternatively, the delivery guy gave another bank account for the payment bank : uob account : 457383548? account holder : ng puay khin? afterwards, the delivery guy asked additional fee of payment of S$15,500. By this time, I felt that something was really not right and told both (the shipper and the delivery guy) that I would report this case to the police.
The person who called me, sounded like an Indian said I won $50,000. He passed the all to another person who is another Indian. He shared I needed to use my viber, video-call him to show him my I/C. I did. I then he asked me to show my credit card or debit card. I said no. I told him I think he is a scammer. then I hang up the phone.
I got a call from a number which is actually the MOM contact phone number. The caller said he was from the ICA and sounded very threatening. he gave a name which i couldn't get and was speaking in a false american accent. I asked for his name a couple of times and then i could get that he was actually having a very strong Indian accent. He started asking how long i am living in Singapore and what is my visa status and if i am working somewhere. I replied that I cannot answer such questions over the telephone. on hearing this he said it was just a verification call and disconnected the line.
The scammer called me saying he is calling from Ica and threatening to deport. he was talking in very heavy accent (SINGLISH) that I have been identified as illegal immigrant and that they would soon come to my work / home and take me for deportation. I threatened to call the police, which prompted them to end the call.
I received a call from +65 63568876. A man claimed to be from inland revenue authority and he repeated it a few times. he said i am entitled to tax refund of $890. This sounds definitely a dubious call to scam me. our authorities do not call us for refund and any refund from tax would just go straight into our account. when i told him i was going to hang up, he quickly terminated the call. i received another call from similar number. +65 63568872 in the afternoon but I did not pick it up.
I got scam by this company JR credit, I wanted borrow 1k. WhatsApp them, only to find out that I NEEDED to borrow from them as a record first, they transferred $200, then I have to transfer back to them is $380 and I do so transfer THem back $380 and they told me the loan will be approval. However, I received another WhatsApp and was told that the first transfer was not secure and was told to transfer again.. They transferred me again $200 and I have to transfer them back $350 and I did so again transfer them the AMOUNT. Thereafter, I didn't hear from them again. I then knew that I got scammed. Lost a total of $330.
I wanted to get a loan. Received an SMS, thinking that they are licensed money lender and the interest rates they offer are lower than the local banks. Prior to loan disbursement, he asked for a "payment review". How they do that is by transferring me $600 first then 7 days later, they need me to repay them $1000 and the extra $400 will be deducted from the 1st month loan repayment. I was surprise of the suddenly transfer of $600. I asked for their account number to refund back but I was told I need to pay $1000 instead. I told him I don't need the loan, he threatened that I will still need to continue paying the payment review to clear my name and close my file. He continue to send me voice message to threaten me daily and also send me my house photo which he took from goggle map. He didn't sound local and he even challenged me to report to the police, which I did for safety reasons. And I didn't take up the loan offer. Don't respond to any of SMS-, WhatsApp- messages offering loans as they are illegal!
Caller posing as "singtel company" in their viber profile called me on viber saying that i won S$50,000 from a lucky draw. i told the caller that it sounds like a scam and hung up. after, i searched the internet and found this site who shared similar experiences. i also contacted singtel and a customer care officer indeed verified that it is a scam. this site has been very helpful. thank you. let's continue looking out for each other and be careful everyone.
Came across this online dating profile send a message via Instagram in Feb 2019, message replied on 6 March then slowly exchange details in Line. I was being told that she was a student here, no money then asking for a date for $100 sounded very reasonable. Then came the day for meet-up but I needed to pay more for "verification" by purchasing a gift card of $100 and a further payment of $300 in gift cards first for a guarantor. The money would eventually be refunded to me once the person appeared. But the guy named Ah Kun wanted more - $600. By this time, I knew it was a scam, but it was too late.
I received a call from this number. The caller introduced himself as "Dan Murphy" &amp; claimed he called from IRAS for some tax refund. He then asked my bank details. By then I feel uncomfortable as 1 May was a public holiday, and I don't think IRAS work during PHs. I asked again his name &amp; he repeated his name being "Dan Murphy". I then cut the call.
We met on Cmb, he claimed he was new on CMB and was looking for someone serious to start a new life with. He said he is staying in the US and his father is a Singaporean and mother is American, he visited Singapore in February and loved Singapore very much. And he made up his mind to relocate to Singapore if he found his love. He is a petroleum engineer and rewarded a project in Turkey that worth a lot of money. After this project, he would have enough capital to settle down in Singapore and invest in some business in Art. He called almost everyday according to the US and Turkey timing ( very convincing), and sent his pictures consistently, but once I asked for Facetime, he would reject it and gave many excuses to not doing it. After 3 weeks, he said he had some problems with the project and asked for huge amount of money. And he gave his agent's account and appeared to be a DBS Multiplier account. Few days later, he asked to access his company account to transfer money to mine. he also gave me a fake American passport. it was badly photoshopped.

He even gave me a fake bank website to log in to pretend transfer money to me for the parcel payment. Luckily, I didn't believe as i already read abt it. But now they so advanced to include bank website log in etc to cheat victim that he transfer money even send me hotel booking saying he come to sg. sharing so more will be informed.

茜茜 offered sex after introducing herself as a student. She was really persistent, asking several times a week until I finally gave in. Went down to the place, which is at Hougang ave 8/10, block 401 and that's when she asked for my number. I was reluctant to give her at first because it was not necessary. We could call via line. She insisted, and after that this 阿坤 guy CALled me. He asked for payment to ensure the safety of the girl and made sure the girl wouldn't think that the company TOOK the money instead of giving IT to her. So he asked me to pay via Alipay to AW5678@QQ.Com. So based on the amount, it was to be 500 X2 RMB so that conversion would be to 200 bucks Sing dollars. Thereafter, he said there was another payment to be made, and I was getting suspicious, but I still paid another 40 BUCKS using the same method. And he asked for another one again using another reason, AND I was already out of cash. That's when he asked me to buy iTunes cards and said it wasn't linked to his COmpany in HK compared to the Alipay payments. I have already CHEATEd 250 bucks by then, and I didn't want to pay MORE without seeing 茜茜 first. She asked for the 16 numbers of it to VERIfy before she came down to fetch me, but when I asked her to tell me how many lifts there were at the block, she couldn't answer and feign ignorance and that's when I knew it was a scam and came to this page when I googled. This 阿坤 guy continued to threaten me and said he would send his brothers down to find me and messaged and WhatsApp me too. Am going to make a police report soon.
After I got to know this guy Alex tan from Okcupid, then we started chatting on Wechat. He is a Singaporean who grew up in Canada. Chatted over 2 weeks only, and he expressed his love for me and wanted to get in a serious relationship. He wants me to trust him. He told me that he needed 6k desperately to close a business deal. After telling him that I don’t have that money, he said he will try and fix it. A week later, he called on Wechat, That he is short of 3k and desperately wanted me to help him. He had either borrowed from Friends or family members already. I felt something is not right, immediately I deleted and blocked him from my Wechat.
I search for a part time job in jobsearch and come a cross this job link as AN part time online cashier. Emailed the person called dina, asking for vacancies.. She replied describing the job scope and from which company ask for my details and mobile number. After replying to her email, she WhatsApp me. Before I replying her, I checked online to see whether her company is legit, and it seemed legit. After which, I replied her. She asked for my ID and bank account number, saying she needed to verify with her finance dept. This is the worst mistake that I've made - to have trusted her and giveb ALL my details. The day after the conversation I messaged to ask whether I had been approved for the job, and she suddenly replied and say a small amount has been transferred to my account, to check asap and find the nearest bitcoin machine to transfer the money. As i don't know how to use bitcoin atm, I told her to give me a direct account number and i transfer her back the money. and she did. after a few weeks, my bank account has been freezed by the authority. i went to make a report and they say i am being investigated. The worst time of my life, salary would be FREEZED as no withdrawal are allowed to be made by my account. i have 4 kids to feed. And if after investigation and they think im not in the wrong, my account will only be refreeze in 2-3 months time. 😭😭😭MY only fault is to have the thinking that i could work extra job to earn extra money. please be careful everyone. my case is still under investigation. please don't trust easily.
Online friend messaged me on april 2019. He claimed that he is Korean and had seen my number on Paktor app. Hence, he is messaging me. He introduced himself as eunjin (+82 7045157073). He is easy to talk with and never fails to message every day. He is always so understanding, comforting, assuring and supportive. It was easy to fall in love with him. He says that the business in the oil sector is bad and he will be going to brunei soon to do a big investment. He says he works for park Choung oil and gas of which he has partner under gs Caltex gas station eunma. He told his mum and sister that he has a girlfriend and his sister wants to meet me. Sister by the name of Veronica claims to be studying medical school in Germany. He flew off to Brunei as planned to start business talks with oil partners to purchase 31000 barrels of oil at $62/ barrel. He said that it is a reasonable price and it is cheaper than Middle East. The total investment is about 2 million dollars. Two days later, he feedback that he is very stressed as government tax is involved and he could not raise the amount required. Amount required was usd$12000. I told him he will have to think of means himself as i do not lend money, especially to a guy that I have never met or video called before in my life. He began to be defensive and used a lot of reverse psychology methods to make you feel guilty. I requested him to produce his identification card, boarding pass from Korea to Brunei, flight reference number from Brunei to Singapore and hotel booking reference number. Unfortunately, he couldn’t give. For boarding pass from Korea to Brunei, he says that he has thrown it away. The passport was confiscated till he made the payment so he couldn’t send me that. As for flight reference number, he couldn’t access his email to find it but kept reiterating that he will fly to Singapore on 26/4/2019. I contacted the hotel name which he gave and was told that no such reservation could be found. Amount was lowered to usd$7000 the next day, but I showed him that my bank account only has 1900 sgd. Today, 26/4/2019, he says that he needs usd$1700. I again told him to send me proof of identification. He says I am stingy and selfish to leave him in the lurch and he is going to suffer from depression because of funds. Many times, he says that because he is shy, he doesn’t dare to ask funds from his business partners and friends, but in my opinion, when you are desperate, you ask everyone, not someone that you have met for 17 days only.
I wish to bring to attention questionable contact and sales tactics by two companies, Asi? Claim and Paremount Strategie?. My mum, a victim of the Geneva gold scam, was contacted by a certain Susan (+65 8374 695?) who claimed to be calling from Asi? claim. Susan said that Asi? Claim is a litigation company and is helping victims of the Geneva gold scam to recover their monies through a civil class action lawsuit. Susan received my mum's number through someone who was also a victim of the geneva gold scam, and who had given Susan my mum's number when she made a claim assessment report with Asi? Claim. I accompanied my mum to the Paremount Strategie? office on 23 april 2019 to make a claim assessment report. While waiting to hear back on whether my mum was eligible to be part of the lawsuit, we were offered one share in Wyndham Sundancer resort Lombok which guaranteed usd34,000 in 5 years, in exchange for 3 pieces of the gold she had on hand which was bought from Geneva gold. We were not informed at any point prior to the appointment that we would be subjected to such a pitch during the session. Questionable aspects: (1) Susan contacted my mum several times to persuade her to take up the case. When i spoke to Susan, she insisted that i could not accompany my mum when she was being interviewed for the claim assessment, even though she did not understand English. (2) The people we met at Paremount strategie? (the supposed sponsor company which is doing the 'interview' for the claim assessment on behalf of Asi? Claim as they do not have an office in Singapore), a certain Miko Tse and a guy called Sean (or similar) with a strong British accent, kept us in the room and said we have to listen to the gold-for-share proposal (see s/n 1). They prevented us from leaving the room, took turns to explain the proposal, and claimed that the lawyer's reply had not come in several times I asked. (3) the day before, a person supposedly from the law firm and speaking with a strong British accent calling from a Malaysian number (+60 18-221 731?) called to inform my mum about the appointment. I took the call since my mum could not speak English. On the morning of the appointment, my mum received an SMS reminder. I called the number from which the SMS was sent (+65 8599 270?) and spoke to a certain Rosie. This was when i found out that the 'sponsoring' company is Paramount Strategie?. I found it suspicious that when i spoke to Sean (or similar) at the office, he seemed to know that the 'lawyer' called the day before to confirm the appointment; I suspect they could be the same person. According to Miko, there are people who have taken up their proposals. I hope to bring this to your attention IN CASE THIS TURNS OUT TO BE SCAM AND MORE CONSUMERS FALL FOR IT.
Last Nov 15, I went to find discounted hotel rates in carousell and found user: TRAVELLER19. We made a deal and he has asked me to give deposit amounting to $400 SGD, to stay for 2 nights from Dec 15-17 in MBS. ON dec 12, he messaged me via whatsapp and carousell, that he had work emergency and he had to leave Singapore for a couple of months as he was asked to fly to us and he will be back after CNY. I asked him if he has other means to make the refund, but he said he does not have as he was not Singaporean. I asked for a picture of his IC, or passport. He sent me a passport picture. I messaged him again via whatsapp however is already unable to receive my messages.
Buyer contacted me thru whatsapp for a samsung galaxy s10+ that i was selling on gumtree for sgd 1000.00 on the 15th april 2019. He wanted to buy this for his daughter's birthday the following day, so wanted the delivery man to pick up the phone on the same day. he sent over a screenshot which showed the transfer of SGD1040.00 (inclusive of delivery man fees of SGD 40.00) from bank of america to my dbs account - all seems well and it usually takes 2 to 3 days for interbank transfer to show in the statement. The collection was made on the same day and i paid SGD32.15 to the delivery man. I followed up with the buyer over whatsapp everyday to check with his bank on the payment delay - unfortunately he has decided to block me on whatsapp today 23/4/2019 and i have no way of contacting him now. i have lost the phone and the payment to the delivery man. Other identifying details of this buyer is that he claims to be an engineer working on an offshore platform.
I got in touch with a DDaeng on Carousell to get a last minute staycation as it wasn't available on official site. I was looking to take over someone else's booking. This seller is a verified seller with a 5-star review and thus I thought it was safe. She got a WhatsApp number from a Jessica to msg me and we dealt accordingly - with me transferring 220 over to another PayNow number (Janie). A confirmation was sent and i emailed the hotel to confirm the booking (they took 1 day to reply). The next day, on check-in day, Jessica WhatsApp-ed me to inform that due to a system glitch, my booking was not captured and the hotel would compensate me with a 2-night stay instead if i would agree to change the date. I refused and asked for refund which Jessica said would take 5-7 working days to process. By then, hotel got back and said my booking does not exist at all. I questioned Jessica and she replied "booking is under 3rd party system that's why hotel couldn't check" and to wait for my refund. Of course refund didn't come till now and i got scammed. The carousell seller told me she was a student earning commission from this. And after we got scammed, she broke all dealings with scammer and she washed her hands off. Although i only bought due to her verified/good reviews status, she just step out of the situation. Not even sure if she's real. Just be cautious when dealing on Carousell.
I received an SMS from Singpost informing me that I have won a reward in their draw. A strange looking link led to a Singpost look-alike site. The form and the language looked very phishy. the website link was strange too - funien?.com BEWARE! this is a scam. It feels scary that my name, phone number and email are known to the scammer.

Got into contact with the Moneylender called Ivan from fast credit pte Ltd. Wanted to take a $10k loan over a period of 3 years. Gave him picture of my ic front and back along with my CPF statement. Was told to do a trial payment before loan can be approve. Ivan transferred me $700 for $1000 loan repayment within a week. Before week is up, I ask him I want to pay, he ask me to transfer $300 only. Once done, he ask me to transfer another $1000. But I transfer thru Ibanking. Was told that money is stuck and need to pay another $1000 thru atm which I did. After that still need to pay another $3.2k to activate my account. But I did a late Payment and have a pay penalty of $1.8k by then I was already threatening them that I will call the police cause too much money given. Ivan promised that the $1.8k was last and after that I will get my money on top of whatever I have given them. Once I given the $1.8k, he called me to say I need to pay govt tax of $1.7k. I give up afterwards. Paid too much but not a single cent received. Told Ivan I got no more money to give and next day went to the police. Police told me to block the number and do not contact them. They started to harrased me with different numbers and threathing to burn down my house. Threatened my parents also by calling their mobile number and my house number. Not worth the trouble all to go to this moneylenders. Made me think who is the moneylenders now, me or them.
Received this message: Dear Customer, On 12 April 2019, your name came 3rd on our SingPost' April list. Don't forget to collect it here: http://opn298.com/g?? IT asked for my personal info online but I did not submit.
Met this person online through a dating website called lovehabibi.com. Almost 2 weeks into knowing him, he told me he bought stuff for me from Dubai since he's there before flying off to Germany. Received a receipt from him but its does't look credible since there were traces of white spaces erased and replaced with details. I received an email shortly and said i had to pay for handling fees since he already paid $2500 for shipping the items. It was $835 and i had to pay immediately for the items to be shipped out from dubai to singapore. It will be transitting from malaysia tgerefore i had to pay that amount to a woman. I emailed back asking why should it be paid to a woman instead of a company. I looked up the website on the email and it came up to an online horse betting platform. I googled his number and i saw information about bitcoin. I immediately realised it was a scam so i did not make any payments at all. I will make a police report soon.
I met one girl through the matrimonial app (Bharat matrimony) named Anisha kumari(kriya4735@gmail.com/+1 (209) 580-8071/+44 28 4378 0177) as a marriage proposal who lives in the UK. We chatted each other for a couple of weeks and she told she was sending some gift items to me so I shared my address with her and she told she sent some items to surprise me not revealing the items. After a couple of days, I got a call and mail from courier service named Transnet (transnetcustomerservice@gmail.com/info@transnetcourierservice.com/+60 3-9212-1454/+60 11-5314-9498) stating I need to pay 3200 dollars to them to get the package and I transferred through online banking to the specified account and after a couple of days got the call again from them stating 3200 is USD and not SGD and asked me to send 1200 SGD more so that they will deliver the package and I transferred them to the specified account. Again after a couple of days got a call again saying I needed to produce money laundry insurance certificate since there is some cash in that package. I paid 7500 dollars to the courier service to get the certificate by depositing the amount and they are demanding another 15000 dollars. I checked with Singapore customs about the certificate and they told there is no such certificate and asked me to lodge a police complaint. then I realised this was scam and I lost so much amount in this. I lodged a police complaint in January since I lost 11900 dollars in total and now also I am getting calls every week from the scammer to send money to me.
Received a call and caller ID displayed this number: 96539479. When i picked up the call and it was a pre-recorded voice ( Mandarin) come from other end . It claimed that tel company ( it didn't mention which tel com) detected an unknown signal and requested me call back . To continue press # . As it was clearly a scam call, I hung up the call.
Scammer gained access of my friends WhatsApp account and sent me a text saying "I sent something to your number by accident, can you send me? It's urgent". That code turns out to be my verification code. But I could not tell because it was in arabic(COULD be other languages too). Almost immediately, I got locked out of my WhatsApp. When I tried getting another verification, the interval between each gets longer and longer because the other party is also trying to get verification.
Matched with this girl 艾咪 on Tinder, she asked me to add her on LINE to chat instead. She offered me sexual services at $100 for 2 hours at Block 532 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10. I was asked for my mobile number, after which a Chinese man with a heavy accent called me from an unknown number to instruct me on how to make payment of 100 SGD/ 500 RMB of Alipay credits. Once this was done, he continued to ask for $600 SGD as a deposit to ensure the girl’s safety, claiming this will be returned after the service. At this point, I refused to continue and this man proceeded to threaten me by saying he can use my mobile number to track down my home address and cause harm to my family. After hanging up, 'girl' continued to message me telling me what will happen if i do not pay up.
Cold call from automated voice message (Mandarin and the.n English) impersonating police and requesting ic to be taken to a police station and to press 1 for help in mandarin or 2 for help in English.
I get to know this man named Charles nguyen from Paktor. He is a freelance architect &amp; interior designer. He uses a poor Thai guy's photo as his profile stating he is a caring person with open and warm heart. He values honesty and integrity. He spend days and time talking over the phone consistently. He made me fall in love with him. Talking about the future, flying to Singapore to see his Grandma who was like a mother to him, saying that he will come to seek my parents for hand of marriage. He says he is flying to Dubai to get building materials for his project and he need financial support as he mortgage his own current house to tide him through this project. He begs and asks for support and says that he needs to complete the project so that the organisation will compensation for the Project. Due to tight cash flow issues, he asked me to help him by transfer money to the building material manager in Dubai. I've made a total of 3 transfers amounting to SGD26,866. Eventually, project payment got screwed and I used up my money and he says that there is still outstanding payment to the building material company as they have sent extra material so that it does not delay his project because It was new material that he purchases and not quite sure it fits. He continues to beg me to transfer another USD560 to clear so that the company can send more materials to him so that he can renovate his second home And thereafter that he can sell And to have cash to fly in to singapore. I then realised that he used another person's picture and realised that it's all a scam!
I knew this guy named Smith Wong on Happn (a dating app) on 5 April 2019, and after the chat for a day, he asked for my phone number, and we chatted on whatsapp. he mentioned that he is American born Chinese and originally from Beijing, parents stay at Arizona and he works as a subsea supervisor at Miami. During the chat, he mentioned that he's quite wealthy and he's a lovely talk person. Within a week, he offered to courier gift from USA to Singapore, he even sent me a website to trace the parcel. Besides provided the tracking number of package, he also mentioned that there will be a clearance fee to retrieve the package, and he was smart, he said that he also attached the cash in the parcel, so I won't incur any losses. So today (15 April 2019), a guy called me regarding the clearance fee, and I requested that he sent me an email attached with the invoice. However, he only emailed me the instructions and attached a personal bank details. I requested for corporate bank details but he didn't. Nevertheless, I did the background search for the logistics company and I couldn't find it.
note: I was not scammed, but think this is a potential scam I was searching for ipad pro on facebook, and found this person named nandini shukla. she is selling ipad pros and other devices. The worrying thing is that she is from india, she refuses to allow pick up for the ipad pro, and says that she is selling a 10.5 " ipad pro at $500, buy 3 get 1 free. the testimonials she sent after was of people smiling with phones, and whatsapp chats, with dodgy whatsapp wallpapers of phones. i have reason to believe this is a scam. Always check the background of the sellers before trading with them. While checking reviews is an important step to take, they can be faked. For expensive items, and if the seller is local, request to pay after receiving the item.
I was matched to this guy on coffee meets bage. We chatted on WhatsApp for 2 weeks before he asked if we could meet. After arranging everything for the said date, he cancelled the meeting as he said he needed to go to Turkey for a an important business stuff. And so, we need to reschedule it once he comes back in a week. As the date was approaching, he said that he was mugged and stranded in Istanbul, and all his valuables including the passport was taken and that his phone was smashed breaking the screen and camera, but he was alright. He said a friend is already helping him with purchasing a return flight back to SG and he's already applied for a new passport in his embassy. by the time he had "received" his new passport he needed help to settle the airbnb billing $550 usd. and asking me to help me pay it. when i responded that i can lend him money once he arrive here in sG instead of sending it. he got defensive and said he needed it now and not later on. then after that asked me to help me purchase itune credit worth $150. I did not response after that. blocked him and reported him in whatsapp and coffee meets bagel.

I was nearly scam on coffee meet bagel. Be careful of overseas people on dating website from stolen profile from instagram or facebook. always video chat them to know. Don’t believe excuses such as the phone is smashed or the wifi is not good .never give money to them 1) Do a reverse image search on the photos provided. 2) never send money to western union or moneygram in any emergency. 3)never believe in sob story like parents died ,child sick ,stuck in airport, taxation ,accidents, robbedAlways consult with family members or close friends to advice as sometimes you will be caught up with emotions, and not being clear headed. Scammers may work in a syndicate and are experienced con artists. The scammer stole pictures from a urologist in Malaysia and I have inform him that his photos have been stolen. I’ve informed the person whose pictures were stolen to warn him. I have blocked the person and anyway is all fake accounts and email : Frank Cheng
MY uncle got a spam text message from SingTel Mobile number +441548312048 asking him to key in his personal contact details within 1 hour to win a Samsung phone for $2.50. He submitted his personal details and he got suspicious when the website asked for his credit card details next. He asked for my opinion and I found that the mobile number is from England and the website isn’t related to SingTel at all. My uncle was nearly cheated because he trusted that SingTel has such reward system. I hope everyone is aware of these scam messages and hope that seniors would not fall for it.
A guy from LinkedIn befriended me and later asked to move to Whatsapp. He was nice and very gentle where more likely girls might fall for. He’s working in Marathon Petroleum Corporation in Texas but relocated in Turkey Black Sea in an Oil Rig for 3 months. He mentioned he cannot use video call and calls due to company’s rules and regulations. As an alternative, He used to send more pictures. So for a month chatting, being friendly and really caring, and there’s no trace of anything that was suspicious because there’s no money involved so I continued to play along. He profess his love with more passion and promise to call and visit me once his off from the rig. But when the time his ending his last month from the rig. He mentioned about a new contract that he won for him to extend for another month to handle the Project. Having this contract will boost his credentials and additional income. After he told me this I’m a bit suspicious because he never mentioned such things in earlier stage. So I try not to bother much about him anymore. But he still persistent in his timing to care for my being. Then one day, he sounds serious and told me that he’s facing difficulty in the project that he’s handling. In short he tried to ask for financial support and that’s when everything turned into disappointment. It’s such a waste of time. I feel really bad for that guy photos used for this type of scam (It was a Korean and really good looking.) The details and story used by this scammer wERE already reported here last November 2018 with the same username. Luckily I did found this website to support my suspicion. So ladies, please be careful!
A John Michael called me thru’ Viber using this number: +966552321403 and told me he is from SingTel and that I won SGD$50K. However, my mobile phone line is under Starhub. He asked me to provide him my bank account or credit card number so that he can transfer the prize money to me. I requested that he drop me an official email.Be wary of such scam!
Met a lady called, Adrian, on coffee meets bagel(CMB) dating app on 2Mar2019. She said she is a S'porean, based in USA, lost parents and a medical consultant running her own business. After 1 month of chatting, she said she'll be coming to sg, but will fly to shanghai for biz before coming to SG Just the day before her trip on Sun(7Sun, New York time), she said she was in pain and cannot move from bed and needed her dr, whom she called. eventually she made the trip and now in shanghai. This is when she text to ask for monies to pay her Dr in USA to get some special drug sent to shanghai. she gave her personal bank account online logon to try to trick me in showing she is a millionaire as proof of her ability to transfer monies back to her. alarm bells was raised few times as she did not accept video chats. I'd reported her ID to CMB, now I'm reporting it here. No monies were lost as I was lucky to be wary.
Jerry befriended me on facebook and started chatting on facebook messenger. After which he said that he is seldom online so wanted to move to whatsapp. I am used to travelling around so i do have a lot of overseas friends. So we did. He declared his love after chatting for about a month. He said that his dad had passed away and his mum lives in the uk with her sister. He is living alone in usa and was brought up by his uncle. His ex girlfriend had cheated on him. Since then, he has been alone for 2 years. He said he is going to come Singapore for a visit on his birthday, 26 April. Next thing that happened was that he suddenly had a contract that he is vying for. Out of 21 applicants, they are going to choose 7. Then he was going to fly to New York to win the pitch. So about 6 hours later, he said that he had won the pitch and wanted to send me presents that he had bought. Initially i believed, because i do receive gifts from my overseas friends at times (people whom i know in real life) so i gave my address. After that the conversation became strange with him asking me to check the courier company's website every day. Then i found out the courier fee was sgd3000. No way the courier fee is $3000. That was when i got suspicious. I started asking questions and requested for a video call to see him. I was told he cannot use camera and video function on his phone because he is in the management role which i know was not true as he had sent lots of selfie over and including one screenshot which was obviously from a screenshot of video of himself (poor guy whose photo is stolen from). He then called and the accent was totally not an american born chinese (abc). I played along for a while to get the courier company's details. On the day that the courier company asked for money, was the day his facebook profile was deleted. That was when i enlisted the help of my sister to photoshop the page of the courier company and sent him back to say that the parcel is on the way back to usa and he had to pay usd to retrieve his parcel. After that, i blocked him and when i checked on the courier company's website, the order number became invalid. Luckily, no money was lost and we got to troll him back.
I received a call from this +966 55 236 9019 with a name ‘Starhub Company’ telling me that I won $50,000 dollars. This guy was persuading me to get my money when I didn’t even join any lucky draw and I’m not even using postpaid for my sim card. I quickly end the call. Beware of SCAMS!
Already been experienced by few Singaporeans,got an email saying that she was interested to rent a room. Wanted to 3 months' rent in advance through PayPal. Then a fake PayPal email came, telling me that an additional $500 was being transferred over to me and I need to transfer the back to Philippines vial Moneygram. "She" also attempted to gain credibility by sending picture of I/C over. Please be wary! Emails from PayPal were all fake!
I know this guy thru dating app call Paktor. He msged me via the app and requested me to go offline so that we can concentrate developing our relationship. So since early march we have been watsapping each other. And he was a very loving guy and show you much care and will watsapp you promptly everyday without fail. So my feelings for him has grown deeper each day. Till 2 days ago he requested me to help him send one email requesting Ziraat Bankasi to release funds for his offshore project in turkey. He say his reception offshore is very bad and cannot send out email. At that point of time i was already suspecting, so I do a check on the email address given by him and found something fishy. But still I send out the email for him. After that he suddenly say told me that after he check he say in order for the bank to transfer funds he need to open a deposit account and need to out some money inside and request me to help him deposit 15K. I told him I don't have that much money as I know there's something wrong already. So he requested me to put 5K instead. So I received an email from the so called ziraat bankasi asking me to deposit USD 5k into one account number. So I whatsapp him saying that I thought it was Sgd 5K, if it's USD 5K I can't help him. So he again asked me to write to the bank and asked the bank to revise the amount to Usd 3K instead which is equivalent to usd 5K. Surprisingly the so called bank reply was very fast and reply within 5 mins. So I found this totally wrong. After thinking I decide to wastapp him n tell him that all these is a scam and I will not help him with this deposit. So he started texting me saying what's wrong with me? What's wrong to all the things we plan etc. I just ignored him. Till this morning he still try to coax me into this deposit thing. Please be careful and don't fall prey to such scam!
This is regarding my FDW that works for us Ms Charlene Entredicho. The company Asia telecom called her up in August 2018 and offered to her to participate in a promotion that she can win all kind of THINGS if she tops up 900 peso to a prepaid wallet in PHILIPPINES. After she agreed she got a bill of 60 SGD which is almost 3 times more than the value she got in Peso. Later the company continued to call her and send her frequent text messages and whatsapp telling her to pay the outstanding bill and also telling her that she needs to topup more in order to participate in the promotion. Overall they sold her ~1600 peso worth 41. SGD and charged her more than 120 SGD. After I heard the story I called up the company to try to sort this out but they were not willing to do any settelment and request that she pays all the remaining balance. this company is using the helpless and innocent helpers promising them promotions and not enclosing the very high costs of the topups and then they continue to HARASS and get more and more money.
Went online to purchase a new TV. Found an advertisement on Craigslist (WhatsApp number supplied). Contacted the seller and was advised if payment was made today it could be delivered in 2 hours. I asked for it to be c.O.D but seller was insistent that to get the deal it needed to be bank transfer. Transfer made $998.00, deal done... delivery on its way. However, 10 mins before it was supposed to arrive I was told my item was held up at customs and needed to pay extra $480.00 for it to be released and I would receive the $480 in cash on delivery. When I started asking for proof it was obvious I had been scammed....
I got to know a guy named ‘Tag Brown Chang’ from coffee meets bagel. He claimed to be half Singaporean and half Kiwi, grew up in Singapore and went on to study engineering at NUS. He claims to have lost both parents and have a sister residing in New Zealand. His NZ hometown is in Dunedin. He owns a company that provides pipeline maintenance services to oil and gas companies such as petroleum group from the USA. He is currently on short-term contract work in Indonesia and typically returns to Singapore almost every quarter to visit his son in Malaysia. He claims to be a divorcee, ex-wife is living in Malaysia with the son. What is highly suspicious about him is the immediate confession of love and commitment to a serious relationship within two days of short texting. I became suspicious and googled for scams under his name and found a scam alert published on 28 Dec 2018 where a John Chang brown was mentioned as a scammer. This immediately raised alarm bells. Glad that I searched for clues before it went too far!
It is 9.30pm and a man bearing a file with two letters comes and ring the door bell, he says he is a ex convict and was sent by the Singapore police force parole division authorized by the Singapore charity board, all letter look like photocopy of print outs, he say the Singapore parole officers were sending these ex convicts to sell mobile phone accessories to the public so as to support their livelihood, and that these was authorized by the Singapore charity foundation and Singapore police force. when I asked him further question, he refused to answer and became very pushy and started to swear in hokkien like the local gangsters around our estate. He then quickly put his mobile phone accessory into his pocket and left. I was amazed that the Singapore police force parole division was starting such a scheme , as a person who has hired ex convicts before, I know that the police parole officers would try to arrange full time jobs for these ex convicts so that they may turn a new leaf in life. But what I found weird is that the Singapore police would send out these ex convicts to seek donations. Please verify all requests before donating!

And this time round, he asked for another SGD900 to pay for the hotel room fees for not paying for the hotel. after afew month he claimed he still stuck in Brunei. I attempted to chase back my money SGD5,100 and he still asked me to lend him and threatened not returning back to me all my money if he couldn't raise another SGD900 to pay for the hotel room fee charges and even used so-called his mother to pressure me for money help through wassapp messaging.

I just received a call from someone claiming to be a senior immigration officer in Singapore. The person said, I don't have updated my "alien registration number" while coming to Singapore and it's a crime to continue working like that. They are sending cops to my home in 30 mins and have to deport me and my wife today. I can also avoid this by purchasing an apple itunes card worth SGD 4000 for them from nearby 7-11 or fair price shop. I checked with MY company, our immigration consultant and Indian embassy in Singapore, it turns out to be a fake/spam call as there's nothing called as alien registration number. This person had called my wife first and then called me. He threatened us for custody and SENDING cops to home to arrest. overall it was a scary experience. Unfortunately, I have provided my passport number, ep number, singapore address and India address. Please beware of such scam!
William Wang, an American Chinese on okcupid. Claimed that he is coming to Singapore to purchase a condo, but cannot transfer funds over. Wanted to transact using hard cash instead but money was confiscated at Customs. At first, asked for bank account for transaction, but I refused as I got suspicious. Be wary, ladies!
Received an SMS from “SingPost”, which I assumed was a scam message. There is no contact number from which the SMS was sent from. SMS provided a link which led a website that showed that message informing you that a parcel was being processed (message indicated that an Iphone was in the parcel). Please beware of this scam!
A guy name peter (ig @chungp?) followed me on instagram and dm-ed me. he started with introducing himself and said that he added me because he thinks that i'm pretty. we chatted, and then exchanged contact number. after that, we started chatting on whatsapp. so, he told me that he is a civil engineer working for zion oil and gas. also, he claims that he is from china but residing in usa california. He would greet me in the morning with a "good morning" text everyday without fail and would send a "good night and sweet dream" text when i was going to sleep. he does all the sweet talking with all the love emojis until one day he told me that he is working on an offshore contract and wanted me to pray for him. it then followed by him saying that he went shopping that day and also did some shopping for me and was going to mail it to me. he proceeded to send pictures of the items he bought which includes a Chanel bag with a brown envelope that contained usd$19.8k, jewelry, LV flats, iphone 7 and iphone 8. i was overwhelmed. i told him that i don't want any of these and he begged me to just receive it for this time and he would not do it again. I was angry so i did not reply him and then he whatsapp call me. I picked up but it was a guy with a strong Indian accent. i straight away knew it was a scam. i hung up the phone and blocked him immediately in all the social media. i went back to check our conversation he had deleted all the pictures of gifts and the text messages. he was probably afraid that i would screenshot and report him.
Received a call this morning at 11.56am A female voice spoke in mandarin about a case I have with the police and asking me to select some OPTIONS relating to my police case. I cut off the line.
The person got to know me through Instagram and tried to send me gifts. Was contacted by Malaysian courier company to pay $3k for the delivery. Nothing was lost.
We met on Facebook and we didn't talk much at the beginning. We exchanged phone numbers for WhatsApp later. Got to know each other better. Nothing seems out of the normal, but after a month later, he sent a parcel over saying it contains gift for me. Received a text after a few days stating, I had to pay customs tax of $2,000 to a personal Citibank account. Sadly for him, I spotted the scam and didn't pay a cent as i know this isn't the proper way of paying taxes for incoming parcel to Singapore.
A man call me through Viber, he told me that i won $50K prize money. So, he asked me the account number, and asked me to send over the OTP number through phone. In the end, I lost $500!
I was in need of cash, so I go online and search. After a few day ,I received an SMS about loan then and I take a look. In the text ,they say they are legal and provide a website that look real. So I gave them my details and photo of the ic to CHECK. Then they say since it was my first time taking a loan from them, they could only loan me a small amount. But when time come to repay and I ask for account but they just said they not have a bank account. They wanted me to pay for defer payment .and I did so and I keep going for some time and then I received another text that I owe the money and wanted me to pay up if not they would come to home and find trouble and they have call my home and took photo of my HOME. In the end, me and my parents filed a police report

I received this Whatsapp call from +1(206)565-2579. Caller introduced himself as Jason, He said my Singtel number won $50,000.00,so he needed my bank account to claim the prize money.I'm aware of scam so i say i don't have account and asked that I come directly to claim the money,he say his head office is in New York and so he needed my family account to transfer the money. After that, I cut the call and blocked the Whatsapp number.
He added me as a friend in facebook and I accept it. He told me he stay and work in Sydney but holding a Hong kong passport. His father is from hong kong and mother is from singapore. His mother and sister had already passed away due to a car accident. he said he is not married but have a son. We actually have common interests, He kept saying he loved me and wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. He always claimed that he is the boss (business man) and his dad also businessman. Photo shown that he is a handsome and rich guy. Then one day, he sent me a photo of 9 boxes of bearing the Lanvin brand and told me that he wanted to send the gifts to me. He said he bought all these for me. When I asked him what is inside the boxes and he refused to disclose. Kept saying that I would know when I receive the parcel. After that he got his manager to arrange out the parcel he sent me the tracking link and tracking number, I got more shocked than surprise. the AWB stated amount charges S$3500. I told him I'm not going to pay for the local charges because I don't have the amount. Best thing is that the parcel is at Malaysia instead of Singapore. I ask the courier company why, he say they don't have a office based in Singapore. There office is based in Malaysia. so I asked them to provide me the declaration for the goods and the invoice for the S$3,500 charge. They said cannot, I will only get those documents after I paid. So I told them fine, please return back the parcel to the sender. Next moment sender called me to find out what is the problem with me for accepting the parcel which he send out. I told him straight away, I got no money to pay for the local charges. Now, he kept silent on me. courier company in Malaysia details : Name of the courier company : Mile fast express The Boss - Mr. Fang Lim (HP no.: +60 16-964 6743) The staff who contacted me : Ms. Celine Chong (+60 11-1282 0544)
Caller called on viber claiming to be from StarHub and that i have won 50000 dollars. I told him i am not a star hub customer and he has called a singtel customer to give this award. He was surprised and asked if i want to decline the award. I suspected a scam and declined the award
I received a call from the given number stating that they are calling from ICA and that I will be deported. Sensing something was wrong I asked him to communicate via email and not to call. He disconnected the call. This just happened today. Beware of this scam!
i made a payment of $700 to secure a dyson airwrap sold on carousell that was sold out islandwide. It was a pre-order and i had to wait 2 weeks. Lister was very responsive to receive money but once payment is made, replies were slow and item eventually never received. apparently the lister is merely an advertiser and not the one who deals with the stock directly. there is a stocktaker and a supplier as well. Long story short, i never got my item and my promised refund never came. it has since been 8 weeks and counting
This man claim to be from cash mart which is a licensed moneylender. I let my guard down and provide my personal details as well as proof of EMPLOYMENT to him. He requested me to take up a short trial loan as i am a new customer. 350 was credited to me and that was to be repaid In a weeks time and amount was 750. After the payment mike told me that new regulation, have to take one more time trial loan of the same amount which i stupidly do so. Atlas, no loan amount was approved but they proceed to credit $700 to me without me asking for it or agreed this time. I sense something was wrong and made a police report. Mike started threatening me with spam calls and messages plus called both my office and my husband too. I learnt a lesson from this scam. They are still demanding 1k from me which i refused to and they said they will keep spam calling my office. :-(

I just lost $100 to a carousell seller. His account name is benjamintan99 and to date nicholas245. He is selling USS tickets for 50$ each. He said he won 3 etickets and he is selling as he wont visit universal studios. He is very engaging...Explaining that he wont be able to meet up as he is very busy at work. when i questioned him about the authenticity of the tickets he was so confident. he advised that he is willing to refund in case it wont work at USS or even better report him to the bank that if i feel he is a scammer. I've never had a bad experience with Carousell and so I fell into the trap. Once he received the money, he started giving excuses (Eg very busy at work, will send during his break) and then he ignored all my messages. I then found out that he is a scammer when people left messages in his listing following up on their tickets as well. He was only selling 3 tickets but we were 5-6 people following up! He is still online everyday in carousell. he just keeps changing his account name or opens a new account. What a shame!
A buyer named Jason contacted me via email and shown interest on some items I listed on carousell. He said he was at USA and if i could send the items to Indonesia for him. I first refused and said i only trade locally then he provided a Singapore shipping address. (look like a hdb address). He them asked for my paypal account email and i sent him my direct paypal.me link. He did not use my link and insisted i give him the email address for the account. I gave accordingly. He then said he transferred the money and asked me to ship ASAP. I logged into my paypal and see no transaction then i double checked the email and found it was by PayPal Intl but sent by transfermoney@usa.com. I then verified with paypal and then agreed that this is a scam.
I receive call from +60328737514 this morning , he claimed that I have a package at DHL that needed to be claimed. I replied him: "nowadays scammer use such high tech-tech". The caller simply hung up the call straight away.
I was being approached by this girl called 茜茜 on Wechat and she told me that she was a student in Singapore and is working as an escort. she offered me sexual service for$ 100/2 hours or $300 to book the whole night. i refused at first but after conversing with her, I accepted it. as i was overseas and only arrived on 11 march midnight, we agreed on meeting up the next day, 12 march 2019. she told me to go to the bedok north esso station and told her once i reached. she asked for my contact number for easier communication. after that her agent called me regarding the payment, saying that i have to pay as a deposit in case the girl was being 'bullied' and many other reason which came 1 at a time after i made payment. after the 7th transaction, i backed out, and fled. but they threatened to locate my location through my phone number and threatened to hurt my family. out of fear, i made more payments. I was scammed a total of $5442, including 3 itunes card ($100 each) and axs alipay machine.
Befriended him on meet up and chatted with him on WhatsApp. He claimed to be a S'porean but lived in US. He's looking for someone to settle down with. His parents had passed on and he’s an only child. He is divorced cos his ex cheated on him. Showered me with lots of loving compliments. Asked me to invest in some bitcoin thingy but i told him i have no money. He said he wanted to meet me in spore and spend time with me. I ignored and blocked him since. all scammers are the same. Sooner or later they will ask for money.
Contacted via wechat in Nov 2018. we started talking about general stuff and after a few weeks scammer brought up bitcoin trading and how she has made a good income. she would send you snapshots of her trades and how much she has in the trading account (more than usd1mm) and profits. they use mt4 trading platform. she then introduced me to the account manager at goldenday and an analyst based ij houston. all contactable via wechat. account manager helped me set up a demo account and analyst advised on the trading. these were profitable almost all the time. then i stated to fund a real trading account in jan 2019. initially profitable and then one day jason recommended a trade that wiped out the capital. before i started trading i couldnt find out anything about this scam. but in december 2018 and up to feb 2019, many similar stories started to emerge online, all concerning this company and they way they operate 1) befriend you via wechat 2) introduce Btcusd trading 3) help u set up demo account that is profitable 4) when u open a real account, it will initially be profitable 5) then they recommend a bad trade and all your capital is wiped out 6) if you have stop loss and have been making money, they will shut down your account and u cannot get your money
Tan Ng approached me on Facebook and ask if he can have my whatsaap number. I gave him my whatsaap number and we communicated thru whatsapp. He told me he was working as a pilot for a commercial aircraft and he lived in taxas city.He sent me a few photos of him. Yesterday, he said that he would be sending me a parcel containing iphone, jewellery and handbags to me. He also said he would be including usd$16,000 in the envelope placed in the same parcel. He said I could use it for myself and my kids. Part of the money, to pay for the clearance and delivery charges at the custom to clear the parcel. I was very confused, usd16000 is a lot to pay for clearance and told him that i don't think it costs that much. I don't need so much money for myself too. He then told me he is coming to singapore in june and we could spent the money together. I WAS VERY CONFUSED THINKING WHY would he trust me so much to send me these expensive present.Today, someone who claimed to be the clearing AGENT NAMED ALEX, ASKED ME THRU WHATSAPP to transfer $2,450 to a POSB account for clearance and delivery charges for the parcel. I told the agent that I don’t have the money and requested the parcel to be returned to the sender. Tan Ng contacted me 5 minutes later tell me to “help” him as usd16,000 was in the parcel. I just ignored his text and went into facebook to check the earlier messenger i had with him and to my surprise, tan's facebook account became invalid. Immediately i know it was a scam. I whatsaap him and tell him that he had played the game well but fortunately i do not have that much money in my bank account to transfer to him.
Few days ago i've matched with this girl 思思 in tinder and added in line. First her is an introduction saying she's a student and part time escort with the rate of $100/2 hr. I declined the offer. Yesterday she offered her service again but i rejected. When she asked the third time today, i finally accepted. Being careful i've asked if she stays alone, if she has family here to make sure no one is behind her (syndicate). She agree to meet me up at admiralty MRT.She was nowhere to be seen but wants my mobile number to be secure. She asked me to meet a friend to ensure she's not being fished by a police. Immediately, I fled as I didn’t want someone else to know. She begged me to stay and proceed while I kept receiving calls from unknown number. I answered the call with the china manager explained the procedures and protocol as she was student part time escort under a hotel.To protect the both parties, payment will be alipay top up from AXS. I purposely left my atm card at home, so he asked for itunes credit ($100) from 711. He emphasised not to drop the call as he will guide me. He then required my ID to ensure I’m not a police but I didn’t have any id with me. He claimed he is one of the 鸿门 member and they are running casino369.com. They have some system that can identify an enforcer. He asked to get my id from my place 15 mins’ away and arranged her to meet me up at the hotel nearby. I went back and sent my license to him. He quickly asked if I am a cop as there is no employment history for my identity except for basic information. He said I could make a deposit to secure the meet up. He'll arrange at a nearby AXS The deposit would be refunded via cash once we meet. He requested for rmb 1000 x 3 (declined as lack of $$) but reduced to rmb 500 ( i bought alipay $104).He got angry for fooling him as he asked for rmb1000 alipay. I told him I couldn’t afford and willing to forfeit. He insisted that deposit must be paid. He threatened to hunt down my family, use my name for money laundering since he has my licence. He give me till 9pm and reminded me that don't go missing or ignoring his calls. However she had instructed me to gather $1200 as her manager has told her to do. She then continued to beg me as she will be in trouble. Now i'm receiving death threats after stop replying her and answering calls.

I got to know this lady on Locanto. Lady agreed that i should pay her $200 for 4 hours of sex and massage I then proceeded to choa chu kang mrt and was told by her that she will get a friend to call me to check if i’m a police or whatsnot. So this guy by the name of 啊坤(Ah kun) Told me that Due to me being a First timer and all to protect me and the girl from being scam, That Instead of paying cash, i should buy alipay credits from the axs instead. As i only had cash with me i told him I couldn’t top up axs due to the needs of using a card for payment and then He persuaded me to find a atm or find a fRiend to TranSfer me first and i can pay back later. So After talking awhile and walking around like an idiot to find a deposit machine, I topped up $200 (1000rmb) as agreed, then shortly after he told me to transfer another $1200 as a deposit in case I do something to hurt the girl. I was told that I would get a refund after my session. I was already feeling like it’s a scam when i was told to purchase the alIpay credit but still proceeded to topped that $200 alipay credits. Then i told the guy on the phone that i don’t have $1200 and even if i do have it on me I won’t be giving it to them and then he started threatening me that he would find me and my family and beat the shit out of us since I "played him out". I know that he can’t do anything so I told him that I would be making a police report. Warning to all male users out there: Please Do not fall prey to such scam. There are scams out there and do not be threatened by these scammers! Don’t make the same mistake i did.

I advertised room rent in easyroom and gumtree in Jan 2019. the RESPONSE was not good. i also did not bother on the room rent as i would like to select a suitable tenant. on 1 march 2019, i was received an email from tan mui joo(chen meiru) asking if the room is available. I replied her that the room is available and i enquiried her some questions such as job occupation, holding any work pass in singapore, etc. she sharing with me that she is working as an it consultant in china but she born in singapore and due to nature of work, she rarely have time making calls. she mentioned that she would like to secure the room and request room pictures including address of the room. i have asked some questions such as location of workplace, if she is holding pink nric, etc. i also request to have VIDEO CALL SINCE SHE IS IN CHINA AT THE MOMENT. I ALSO MENTIONED THAT I PREFER FACE TO FACE TALK. however, she did not answer my queries but email me her pink nric and telling me that she will be back on 27 march 2019. with this, i have more questions to ask because usually if you are back to home country, you will be staying with parents rather to rent room unless there is reason. she suggested to transfer rental to paypal account as she only using paypal account and have not been using online access for so long. she given the reason that she is unable to transfer money because work late and banking hall is closed after she finished work. she even teach me how to create paypal account if i do not have paypal account. in view of this, i google check her name and realised that she is a scammer. I would like to take this opportunity to share my experience to everyone who intended to rent out their room or house, must be aware of this type of people.
Dear friends, I have to give kudos to staff at Clementi Post Office who refused to accept my request to remit money on someone's behalf. Their due diligence have saved me from financial and emotion loss. Here's the story … I have a room to let and advertised online. A person named TMJ responded and expressed interest. TMJ claimed she is Singaporean (even gave her NRIC front image) and returning from China to Singapore. Her only condition was for me to open a Paypal account as it was her only mode to remit money. I suggested other mode of payment but in vain. Once I had opened a Paypal account, an email from service@paypal.com.sg alerted that I had funds coming in but had to wait 3-5 working days before actual fund is credited. The sum was more than what I had asked for because Tenant TMJ wanted me to help her pay her mover's fee as she was away on business trip in India. To pay her mover, I was asked to remit fund through Western Union Bank. I mentioned that I will act once funds are credited into my account but Tenant said the mover needs to be paid 'tomorrow'!!! Cannot wait … With kind thoughts to help, I agreed. Once I was at the Clementi Post Office, the staff asked a very important question. My answer raised suspicions and I was asked to head down to Western Union Bank, near J-cube. As I was driving towards J-cube, I sensed something was not right. Stopped my car and gave Paypal Singapore a call. The answers were shocking! Paypal confirmed there was no funds credited into my account and no email was sent to me. Paypal does not required 3-5 working days to credit any account. Fund transfer is immediate !!!! What a narrow escape from email scammer !!!
Know him by the name of Sean Wang from CoffeeMeetsBagel. His instagram is yongwang100.. he mentioned that he migrated with his parents to Sydney at the age of 5 though his family was from.Malaysia. His profile shows he studied Master from University of Technology Sydney, stays in Darlinghurst. A scammer which I believe is with a team. His story is that he used to work with a company as an engineer but trying to bid projects in different countries on his own. One of the projects is Malaysia and few weeks after he mentioned this, he got a project in Kedah. He sent me his contract letter with lookalike Msia government letterhead. 2weeks later, he came to Msia n started the project.. He said to work in Msia, he has to pay withholding tax for non resident and asked If i could help and the rest he will ask from his parents..Later on, as I mentioned i did not have enough, bank details of the person He asked to transfer But i didnt. Bank name : UOB Account name : Rugayah Marilyn binti abin Account number : 1133010365 Swift code: UOVBMYKL Address : BANGUNAN UOB 10-12 MEDAN PASAR he changed his way stating that he has USD 100K to transfer but I exposed him because is from a gmail account and fraud email info@citbkuk.com . This guy is smart and able to "read" you quite accurately. He was able to share about his daily life in details. 1) He has both Sydney and Msia number +60102817698) 2) He kept changing whatapps profile image including the latest photo of the guy who wore traditional top during CNY (background is with Pig greeting) 3) No result from reverse image search or scam phone number upon checking australia number. Despite this, pls do a reverse image search to check if a profile pix is being used anywhere else. 5) Always ask to do a video call to check real person even if the person gives different reasons Suspicious arose as found that Sydney has no midnight flight but he flew at 4am and 3am to Msia. So beware ladies when you come upon him, I saw him having a new profile in coffeemeetsbagel.
Alex Yang from CMB. architect/engineer from lonDon, UK.

Bext wEre photos of branded goods like Chanel, LV, shoes, jewellery, aNd cash!! I rejected and he insisted and said goods are on the way. (To please him i gave my office address). 2 days later, a guy called me and said my items arrived. A WhatsApp message was sent to me. Below is the message- This is Mr John from International Global Courier Services working with the Custom. You have a parcel from Mr Desmond Lee from United kingdom have arrive here in Singapore.....You need to make a payment of $3850 Singapore dollars for import duties and over weight charges before we proceed to deliver your parcel to your address (my office address) I asked where is he, i go check the product then pay, he said no.

This person by the name of David Wang strike a conversation online with me on 7 Feb via a social forum website. We subsequently continued the chat through WhatsApp. Claimed he is in the real estate profession in New York which sounded genuine. After a few sessions of friendly conversation, he offered to send some gifts which I politely rejected. He got upset and claimed that he can't prove his sincerity which I eventually agreed to his offer and gave him the address. He then texted via what Apps chat on 26 Feb informing the parcel will arrive in Sg on 27 Feb. Claimed that he has left some cash in the parcel which arose my SUSPICION of a dangerous scam. Told him courier company do not allow cash to be sent via parcel. He claimed he uses his regular service provider which is possible to do so. He then informed that it would need 2000usd to get clearance for the parcel to be released and deliver to my door-step. Confirmed this is really a scam, I left the chat and blocked his number.
Pilot_Lim (aka Ruwan lim) approached me on Instagram. He claimed to be a Singaporean born in London. Is a pilot working for Qatar. After just a few weeks of befriending me, he told me he loved me. And sent me a courier consisting of a Chanel handbag, jewellery, GBP of £15,000 and a Gucci sunglass. Days later, I received an SMS from ‘Delivering’ saying that my parcel needs an urgent S$2,500 clearance as it was overweight, before the delivery insurance expires. He urged me to quickly settled the outstanding, and that I could recuperate the fee from his delivery. He wayang-ed by saying “how could you break my heart” when I told him how ridiculous his story was!
Basically i saw this girl on FB and she seems cute so i added her. Started saying hi after she accepted my friend request. When she told me she is an escort and ask me if i wanted to meet. So i said sure why not. She told me her address which was 450 Tampines st 42. I came down there and she told me she can only meet if I transferred $75. After I transferred $75 she asked me to transfer another $150 for the total amount of $200. I was very naive and transfer another $150. When i went down to her void deck that she asked me to, she asked for another $150 for her release fee and told me she would pay back the $150 in cash. But I didn't send her the other $150. I felt like i have been scammed. Lost $200 and almost lost $350 in total.
It happened in Feb 2019 when I wanted to buy a Huawai phone on Lazada.sg and found a great deal. As I thought Singapore being a safe country it cannot be a scam. the seller by the name dhdhfh asked me to contact through Whatsapp which i initially hesitated but later as Singapore was a safe country went on with it. he initially offered me a offer that if i buy 3 phones i would get 2 more phones for free. but i insisted that one is sufficient and told i will pay through Lazada. but he insisted me in not going through Lazada as he will not get the full amount. i told how can i believe him without any details. he immediately sent me a NRIC of a Singaporean. i thought it was real and even cross checked the number's originality. It was real, so I paid him. he then told me to pay via bitcoin. I grew suspicious about it. but later he sent bank details of posb 09391661?. I sent $250 to his account and sent a screenshot. he told me that he will deliver the product by the next day. but it never happened. the next day i repeatedly messaged him. finally he responded but saying that i have to pay the customs in order to get the phone. he gave the second account number 438-18545-3 posb account. his name is tan boon leng and he sent me an nric card photo s781797?h. my money is gone and hope he would get caught. i would track his ip address to be 197.210.45.191 with location in Nigeria, as he is using a vpn. and i reported to jurong west police with Report Number: J/20190223/2036. I have also reported to the POSB bank to take further action. hopefully if they coordinate with the police to catch him.
First i received a message In whatsapp offering a loan in the name of ray Lim and kelvin lim. (Pls see attachement). Because i need money that time, so I applied for The loan, submit my documents thru Whatsapp. After verifying my documents, he let me borrow a small amount first in order to have a record because it's my first time applying a loan with them. Then I have to pay after 1 week with an interest of $100 from the principal amount. After I paid the loan amount with the interest, He then said need to do a second round because his boss Did not approve to let me apply for a bigger amount. Then I stopped communicating with him because I suspect it's a scam.

Guy with mom profile pic befriend and profess love after 3 days of chatting. Seems sincere and constantly checking you out. Went to the extend of asking your thoughts about him and shared about you to his mom. Lovely guy who cared so much about you, and showing his devotion to faith with very strong command in english Said to send a gift and never provided any information on the courier. I received a text saying to pay import charge of $3580. Person who send the text have no absolute idea on the cost breakdown and they just wanted the money Did not reply to the message after. Scammer got emo because i did not comply and i got "emo" too because he did not want to help sort out the issue Sent him a text after and thank him for loving me , and told him to stop scamming people.
I had listed an ad on Gumtree to sell a handbag about a month prior to the incident. Suddenly i was contacted by Whatsapp by someone claiming to be a mother needing an urgent last minute birthday present for her daughter. She told me i needed to mail the bag out to her immediately so that she could get it the next day as she would be overseas after. She asked for my postal code to help arrange a courier service for me. She then asked for my bank account number to transfer me the money for the bag and the courier service. I gave the bank number but told her not to send me the money until i confirmed the shipping. She then sent me screenshots of an apparent wire transfer from bank of America. At this point, I had called courier companies and many told me that it was impossible for the bag to arrive on the stipulated time. So, I told her that I would refund her the money and that we should stop the transaction altogether. I checked my bank and no money was received and in the screenshot she sent it said the wire transfer was 'non-refundable', which was strange. She then proceeded to spout vulgarities at me and threatened to ruin my life and that I would "be dead in 24 hours". Her story didn’t check out as wire transfers also usually cannot happen over the weekends and she sent me a screenshot of her account balance to "prove" that she had paid. I told her she could call the bank since the wire transfer did not go through, and to cancel it, but she still didn't give up.I went to the Police to report the matter as her behaviour was highly suspicious and I was feeling afraid that I could be targeted.
I got connected with this guy called Bee Travis from Tinder. After a few days of chatting on Tinder, we moved to WhatsApp as we got comfortable and as we are both mature and he looked clean n sincere. Travis claimed to be an American from Huntington and a divorcee and father of 1 son, who's studying in UK. We chatted daily over the phone for about 1.5mths. Travis said he's based in Bintulu for project &amp; after would be heading to Singapore. Soon after, he told me he faced problems with his storage equipment n needed to rent a space urgently n the agent there needed him to pay immediately n he asked me for HELP. I don't know why I agreed as I trusted him as we communicated daily! I transferred $6,600 to his agent name Matthew Tzebeng Ng n he promised to return the loan within days. We continue our normal communication till after 3 days, I asked him about my money n he says the guy went missing n he himself felt cheated n he says he paid 6600 to the office when he was at the shipyard.. I'm so devastated &amp; felt cheated. N best thing he asked me to look for that agent Matthew or go to my bank for help. From there, I know it's a scam n to make it look real he provided me with the agent hp n home address n asked me to get money back. I felt ashamed of myself n I didn't dare to share my situation with my friends and get help. After the incident, where our conversation would always be on my loan to him. He became another person and turned cold n he stopped messaging me. I sent him many messages but he didn't reply although he is on WhatsApp. Now, it's been 2months &amp; I knew I was cheated. Please be aware of this Bee Travis Rodriguez... I was cheated n he's a scammer.
I received phone call from Singapore MOM. (Ministry of Manpower). The officer informed me that during my recent entry into Singapore, i wrote my dob (date of birth) wrong on immigration card (instead of mm/dd, i had written in dd/mm) upon verification by the embassy of Singapore in Delhi, it failed. I’ve been told my passport has been “black marked” which means I have to deport Singapore immediately and will no longer be eligible to work in Singapore in my entire life!! A High Court case was raised in Delhi too. I was doomed. I can get out of this if my dob can be re-verified and the case can be closed. But, have to report in Delhi high court by tomorrow to get the verification done and settle the case! He provided me with complete details of whomI should contact in Delhi and about the incident with reference numbers. So, I will have to leave tomorrow morning! He also informed if the verification in Delhi is successful, I have to meet an embassy officer in MOM, to verify my dob certificate, passport, employment pass again here in Singapore. The officer will provide me with the scan copy of immigration card that I had wrongly written, I have to fill in the correct details in the new immigration card. He will sign and email Singapore embassy in India to re-verify and close the case. Verification, case closing charges have to be borne by myself. I was given the option to do the process in Singapore itself by emailing scan copies of birth certificate, passports etc. to the Singapore embassy in Delhi. Then, I can visit MOM later today to meet the officer and finish the formalities to continue my stay. I was totally in it until he said the amount to pay was $900 for verification &amp; $980 more for case closing! Gosh! Little suspicious now, I inquired if he is legal, he made me open mom.gov.sg website (the official, real mom website Singapore) and check ‘contact us’ page. The call on which I am is from the same phone number!! It must be true! Crazy! While he was trying to find closest sing post address so that I can make payment, I for some reason (was smart enough?) To google “MOM scam” and found that MOM website posted an alert warning users of such scams. I immediately disconnected the call.
I have a similar experience as another lady. The person who I spoke to was Daniel Cheung. 'He' was very caring and sweet. Every day, he would WhatsApp me day &amp; night after asking me the contact him via Facebook messager. It's started 25 January 2019. Just a few days of communication, asking me to go to the next level of relationship. I told him I 'm not ready, and needed some time. Last week before Valentine's day. He told me he won a usd5mil contract. He said that my prayers for him worked and he was so happy that he bought iPhone x, Mac, high heels, jewellery &amp; cash 20k for me to spend. He showed me airway bill &amp; photo of the items he bought. He asked me to pay for courier CHRG by using the cash he sent over. 10% would go to a charity and the rest for me to keep. Then, I received call from a courier located in Malaysia asking sgd2500 before they could make the delivery. They provided a Malaysian bank account. I went to the bank to do the transfer. The officer sensed something was not right. Advised me not to make any payment &amp; the officer rejected my request. I told him about it. He said he will ask the courier for a local bank acct. An UOB savings bank acct was provided to me. I did an internet transfer to this UOB account as told. But they claimed the funds was not in. I called my bank &amp; confirmed the funds is out frm my bank acct. They told me to send a screenshot of my bank acct. I'm careful to show them only the transactions Not my bank acct no. They provided me another bank acct, this time a Maybank account, and asked me to deposit cash in it. I was frustrated. I told them I won't be paying them, but they kept asking me to deposit cash now. I finally woke up &amp; sensed something was not right. I called the bank &amp; lucky for me, the previous UOB bank acct they provided was invalid acct &amp; the funds have returned back to me. I sent an lengthy WhatsApp message to Daniel and told him he was not the real person in what he wanted me to believe. By the way, more details on "Daniel": he claimed to be born in Beijing but after his parents passed away, he was raised by an Uncle in USA He was widowed with a 15 year-old son. He owns two house cost abt 350k and 450k each. He works in the marine line as engineerer, and earns a lot. I have learnt alot from this experience and sincerely hope that others won't fall into the devious traps.
When I was trying to rent out a common room and was contacted by this woman who claimed she is currently in China but now in doha for a conference. it seemed legitimate at first when she sent me a front and back photo of a Singapore ic "chan wai yee"( the name was different from that of the email) and a supposed photo of her. She requested that i set up a paypal account so that she could transfer the money. I told her I didn't have one, when i actually did, to delay time. long story short, she told me she transferred money to my paypal account but when i logged in i did not see any payment made to me. i checked the email which she supposedly send the receipt from but it was a dud email. She requested that I transfer over $1450 by western union to an account in Texas USA for the freight fee for her "furniture"/ and I had to do it by today. Anyway, many red flags shown along during our conversation like she couldn't even produce details about herself. Be careful of such scam!
On the 09/02/2019 I saw an advertisement at locanto for apple MacBook 13.3 256GB core I7 8G SSD offering at S$600. I feel excited as the price was below market price. So, I contacted the seller via WhatsApp when asked they did not provide Cod service. And their office was based on Changi airport terminal 2. The seller advised me that if i am interested in making the purchase i can bank in the amount into their company savings account Posb savings Salamfone mobile limited 118-49735-0 The seller Even provide me with their customer satisfaction Cert indicating that Customer is 100% satisfied with their services. Also, she provided me with her ic picture via WhatsApp. At first, i doubted that the information given not sure whether the seller is genuine or not. Few minutes of consideration I decided to transfer the funds via interbank giro method $600 into the scammer account. After I do the transfer, I send the copy of the receipt to the scammer. She advised me I have to wait for 3 hours in order for the goods to be delivered. After waiting for 3 hours i still haven't received the goods. So, I contacted the seller. Then I contacted the delivery Boy. He insisted that I have to pay insurance and vat fees $300 for the custom to release my item. Which I found so ridiculous. By this time, I already suspected that This is a scammer. I request for refund for my money. The scammer promised me to refund back my money but until now i haven't received anything yet.

My mother met this person on a dating website. And he claimed he is a oil rig diver, owner of a oil rig company providing diving services to oil rigs with 50 million in savings. He claims to have a daughter whose mum died while giving birth and now living with grandparents in Taiwan. He is based in Alaska but he is using a local Singapore number for WhatsApp. He also claims to have a condo in woodlands. While he hasn't asked for money yet, he continues to build relationship with my Mom and gathering information on my family. Beware of people who you meet online.
I received a call from a number stating that he is from India High Commission and I entered wrong information on arrival white card. and this case is opened in supreme court, india and handling by so and so lawyer. so to rectify the case i need to pay money. first he asked me to pay through Moneygram services. but, Moneygram services doesn't allow student pass holders to transfer money. then, he asked me to pay through itunes card of sgd 1000. the entire conversation was lasted for 2 hours and i followed blindly and lost $1000 dollars.
The person claimed that he was calling from ICA and tried to convince me that I had done something illegal. I could not stop laughing at the made up accent so he abused me (in Hindi) and slammed the phone thereafter.
We posted an advertisement to sell our stamp collection lately on social media. it was months later when a guy contacted us on social media posing an interest to buy all our stamp collection and offered 25k for all our stamp collections. signs of scam slowly reveal when, 1) he did not show any interest in looking at our stamps and kept budging us to give him our banking information. 2) his english is bad 3) when we checked on the google map, the address he gave was a shopping mall address 4) he said that he is busy in usa and DOESN'T know how to use PAyPAL (ya right ) 5) last but not least, he said that the deal is monitored by fbi (as if fbi is so free) The huge scam revealed when he suddenly send us a pic of an invoice from Grandbank and told us that we need to pay him S$450 to credit the money successfully into our account. little did he know that we have suspected him and did the essential checks. luckily we did not send any products or money over. Hence, would like to use our experience to remind our fellow Singaporeans to be careful and alert. to consult your respective banks if you have any doubts or enquiries. Oh and please remember not to share your bank account details.
Met this 47 year old man on coffee meets Bagel app. was skeptical at first and didn't swap numbers till he seemed more like a regular guy and the CMB chatroom was closing. he made a mistake in the mobile number he sent on cmb so u reopened the chat and eventually we linked up on WhatsApp. Told me he was divorced with a 15 year old son (Jason), was a Swede based In L.A. (USA) and relocating to SG for a contract (turnaround maintenance in oil and gas industry). rejected his request to borrow money for son's study trip and he was nice about it. he also mentioned early on that he was the only son and his dad was sick and needed surgery but his cash flow was too tight. After his contract finished and he received his payment, he said he wanted to send me gifts. didn't want to share initially cos it sounded more like a scam, but eventually have him my home address and email and got a notice of his shipment from a Courier company (Omicron Express). Looked up courier company and had my doubts but decided to take a risk and pay USD$1205 to enable the shipment to leave the port. Then came the usual expected scam storylines of dad dying, courier company emailed to say package was held up cos of cash found in it and asking for USD$10200 PAYMENT IF NOT it will be impounded and I'll be subject to legal investigation, and pics he sent of gifts In the package that were pics from the internet. made a police report here (tip: you need to make a statement at a police station, rather than just report online via SPF e-services if criminal activity was involved). trolled him for a bit then blocked him. Essentially, any storyline with the person being only child or orphan, divorced or widowed and with NO SOCIAL SUPPORT/friends he can turn to for help, AND if he's using sweet words and saying he loves you within a week or so linking up online, is usually a scammer. I took a risk partly out of curiosity and partly cos there were other actions and our phone calls that made this guy seemed normal, but bottom line is still never to lend or give anyone money, even if you've met THEM or spoke to them on the phone. in this case I even had a legitimate-looking courier website with tracking code and updates on the "package" to make the scam seem real.
On january 4, 2019, I saw a part time employment ad on gumtree for a flexible admin job which requires just surveying the supermarkets within 2km of your house residence. i was to be paid $28/hr, with a maximum commitment of 20 hours/ week. and so given that i lack the time but was in need of money, i applied. I first got into contact with "arnold smith" who claims to be a human resource manager ( warehousespecialistau@gmail.com), then got into contact with "erika andersen" (derbysinfo@gmail.com), the order support manager once i was "accepted". i also got into contact with "christian markovic" who claimed to be the hr director, asking for my bank details where you want the salary to be transferred. I was four days into doing the "order reports" when they asked me to register in an e-currency website. that's when i started doubting their legitimacy, and started to search for derby f&amp;b. to my horror, this company has been scamming people from different parts of the world, targeting people to be their money mules. lesson learnt - Do not disclose your bank details and personal details even in an email interview. i had to quickly close down my bank account to prevent any criminal money from getting into my bank account.
I met this guy name Fred Cheung in Tantan app. I have already reported him in the app. Chatted with him for like a day and asked for my number for whatsapp. He looked like a gentleman and DECENT. Pictures of him did not look fake at all. He claimed to be an American-born Chinese living in California. We messaged every day, and he was caring, sweet and sincere. And I thought it might be a good guy. Talking for about a week and he said he had this contract which he had been pursuing for a long time and was asked to go for an interview the next day. And asked to wish and pray FOR HIM and would give me a surprise if he got his contract. Next day, he said that he had been awarded for the contract and he was very happy and did shopping for himself and things he needed for the contract and also took the opportunity to shop for me and would send me before he went for his contract work for 2months offshore. He asked for my full name and address. I did give him my name but not in full and address. He then later send me the link of the COURIER and tracking id to CHECK. I go in the link and check the status. Only showed his name and number with no ADDRESS and with my name and address. He then sent me the pictures of the gifts AND i was shocked. He said that he bought a hp laptop, iPhone x, Samsung galaxy, Scottish hang bag, ladies gold wristlet watch, pieces of jewellery necklace and mention all the jewellery are GOLD. I rejected him and asked to cancel the shipment and he said it was his way of showing his appreciation to me. He did this because he cared and loved me so much. At first, I believed him but after cooling down and doing a bit of research, I found that this courier company is a fraud, and also found many similar cases of love scams. He then sent me a picture of bundles of cash. And said that I could take the money to HELP needy people and the rest is for me and my FAMILY and also mention to meet after his contract. After that, I cut off all contact and blocked him. COURIER: demont courier HTTP://WWW.DEMONTexport.com (fake courier company)
This seller asked me to transfer money but did not mail the products. $35 was lost.
I got a call from a person as ICA officer stating that i didnt provide ALIEN identification No and my country asked to deport me. I am under Dp and newbie to Singapore, I told him to check with my husband. But he THREATENED me to switch off wifi and hotspot. He also told me not to contact anyone for 30 minutes, else POLICE may come in and arrest you. He got my personal information like contact address in Singapore and native place, MY IC, Passport number. He was very rude, and after getting that information he transferred the call to another person. he explained about 3 forms and asked me to pay S$1500 IMMEDIATELY. I said I don't have money and I need to ask my husband. He also got my husband number and told me he will connect in a conference call, but he also warned me not reveal the whereabouts of the call to my husband. I messaged my husband via another number and told regarding the above instance. It was then I relived that it is a scam. Then I told him that I will check on the matter and hung up the phone. The guys spoke in English with an Indian accent.
I got to know Sungho from paktor app. he claimed that he own a wine and liquor shop and has a 5-year-old daughter. 2 weeks into our chat, he says that he is going to Sarawak for a business trip and will drop by sg to visit me. But little did I realise that my nightmare started to happen during his business trip. He claim that his bank blocks his account which resulted in him being unable to clear his good at the custom. Due to this, he requested me to borrow him $3000 and transfer to an account owe by hotel staff (Katherine Chang Kai Ling). He convince me by sending me a copy of his passport as a guarantee. I adhere to his instruction. For the next few days he keeps asking me for help for all sorts of reasons which include tax fee, late payment fee, taxi fee, etc. I even bought him a return ticket from Sarawak to Korea when he claims that his ticket has expired due to his business issue. In total I transferred almost US$11,000 to him. On the day of his return, he claims that the immigration officer does not allow him to board his plane due to unpaid business tax. He even request me to take up a loan for him, which I rejected. My good friend managed to find out that his profile picture source came from one of the Korean tv host's Instagram and prevented me from transferring more money to him. I have made a report after that. I urge the ladies who read this post not to follow my footsteps and beware of this person and people who you meet online. .
At Tampines blk 844 Knew a girl name 甜甜， claimed that she waas Taiwanese, a student, Working part-time by providing sex service to supplement her school fees and expenses. S$100/90Mins. I was asked to meet her at Tampines blk 844. She asked for my HP number when I reached there, said her friend would call me to verify my identity. Her friend (Boss) called me, ask to buy top up card through Alipay as this is the first time his girl was providing service. I bought it although I had my doubts. After he called me again to provide my identity card to make sure that I am not a police. I took a photo of my driving licence, partially covered my IC number. He called me again, asked to put $600 deposit, and promised that I would deposit back after the service. At this time, I was very sure this was a scam. I told him and the girl that I would be going off, you can have my $100. 'Boss' not happy and started threatening me that he would ask 'Ah LONG'/ his guys harass me and my FAMILY at my house. He claimed that he got my HP number and photo, would have sufficient info to reach me. While I ignored him, they kept calling.
I wanted to get a loan to clear off some credit cards thinking that they are licensed money lender and the interest rates they offer are lower than the local banks. Initially he asked for a "payment review". How they do that is by transferring me $500 first then 5 days later, they need me to repay them $800 and the extra $300 will be refunded together with my loan. So on the 5th day, he asked for $200, I asked him how about the rest? He said never mind. A day later he contacted me saying the "payment review" was not strong. So need another review. This kept going on for 3 times and no loan was dispersed to my account. Eventually the total amount I transferred him was $3100 and still no loan. finally when I told him I don't need the loan, he threatened that I will still need to continue paying the payment review until they are satisfied or else they will send people up to my house to collect from my family. They have Malaysian accent when they speak.
This lady from Smart Finance (said she is from a finance company,the background was very noisy, should be this name) called me asking if I will want to earn extra income. I asked where she got my number from and she said i subscribed it hence she is sure i want to earn extra income. I TOLD HER I AM NOT INTERESTED. I asked her again from where i subscribed and she starts to get very impatient say why can't I let her introduce her product since i needed this extra income. i told her i am not interested in earning extra income and tell me where she got my name and contact no, and she starts to raise up her voice and demanded me to listen to her to introduce her product, which after that I just ended the call. cannot even tell me where she is from properly and keeps on insist that i am in need of extra income which sounds so fishy.
29 December 2018 saw a Facebook advertisement for new product that irons shirts and trousers (company - setcoming.com). visited their website which all looked normal (had several products, catalogue and shopping cart). Reviewed the product details and conducted a short google search to find yes it is a new product launching. So decided to purchase which during the checkout stated running an end of year SPECIAL - free shipping (this should have been the red flag - overseas free shipping). Several weeks had gone by (10 January 2019), received no email confirmation and no further details. tried visiting the website to find it is shutdown and that I am a victim of a scam according to the many internet complaints - https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/setcoming.com. Please be wary when purchasing things online and to always, always do your research before transacting with them.
I would like to share and report a scam online retail shop for fraudulent practices. The is sale.vipointe.com. Sequence of event 1) 29 Dec 2018. I made purchase of a samsonite bag on the website. This website is from US but package was sent out from China. Obviously, they operate in China which is evident also from massively ungrammatical emails sent. 2) 16 Jan 2019. A package from the company arrived at my address. The package contained two pairs of fake imitation Rayban sunglasses instead of my samsonite bag order. The condition of the glasses is massively used with scratches and a huge scarp on one of the glasses. I emailed the company on the same day to enquire about the wrong delivery. On the same day, the company returned an email claiming that they had diligently checked the package and it was the fault of the express company (courier) in mixing up the order. This is not possible as the package was in its primary packaging 2 fake Rayban boxes without further external packaging). Which goes to say that when the package was in its original packaging when the company passed the parcel to their courier. Hence, it is not possible to be the mistake of your courier. Furthermore, as indicated on the package labelling, it clearly states that it is a handbag 手提包，which goes to say that person packing would have known the contents when he packed it. 3) 17 Jan 2019. The company emailed me again further expressing the fault of the express company offering a 20% refund as compensation and a “big discount and nice gift on the next order”. They also mentioned that should I want to have my original goods sent back to them, I would have to bear another US$25 and I would have to wait longer for my original order to be sent. 4) 18 Jan 2019. I sent an email stating evidence to the scam. It reads as follow: The modus operandi of the scam online website is obvious: Offer more than 50% of selling price on the website to entice potential victims. Upon receipt of order, they will send out low cost and light weight items pretending that the items were mistakenly sent out by the courier. When they get a response from their victims, they will ‘force’ their customers to send back the item which would incur additional costs which no one would since there is no guarantee that their order will be correctly sent back thus profiting from their scheme.
Got a call from this number 31511230 the guy kept annoying me to open up my browser to access these provided site to show me the investment thingy. Sounded like a scam to me. I'm not sure how he got my number If you aren't familiar with the caller, simply hang up the phone.
So, "DHL" called but I guess I was blur as I didn't recognise it was a scam at first. . . Even after they spoke in Chinese!!! I asked for an English officer but they said very nicely that they were unable to get one currently because they were located somewhere else. I being blur thought it was true. When I asked for the name she said it was Tang Yi Fei. She said that I had sent a parcel out on 4/1/19 and it was held by the Beijing authorities. It contained 8 fake passports. I said I was going to contact sg police, but they kept diverting me. I eventually ended the call and they called back saying that I was involved in a syndicate gang. The number they used to call was +08610110.

Please kindly get back to me with some pictures of the room and your address for me to forward to my mover's agent to calculate the total cost of moving my stuff over there. I have attached my ic with this email for you to have a view of me, This was the exact narrative of the scammer some previous cases described.
Similar to one of the Scam alert person's story, I had money issue, msged a number where i received via text msg from as "licensed money lender" they called themselves as FAST CREDITS PTE LTD. The person whom called and talked to me called himself "Danny ong" they asked me $800 as a refundable deposit and followed by another $800 coz his system problem and so on... at last, threaten me to give them $1200 as a final cancellation fee when I didn't even get a single cent from them as a loan. I paid him total of $2000
Started with his personal message through MEET-up APP messaging, saying that he was deeply attracted with me. then continued to telling about each other through email, and chat through google hangouts. i was so naive and open to share my personal matters. I feel that he is aggressive. knowing that i am single and available, he tried to win my heart; in one week he wrote 3 emails: about himself, write me a poem, and telling me a detailed story about how his ex wife cheated on him. Honestly his email and chats made me wonder if this could be real.. luckily one of several friends whom I shared about this told me sternly that this definitely is a love scam. so I already signed out my hangouts. if he emailed me again, i may just ignore it or told him off. I am thankful that i am spared from further lies/loss. after realising that I am his prey, I could recall more and more parts that are odd. I cannot comprehend why people can be so wicked.the evil is really there outside, beware!
I've been receiving several calls from an automated “DHL” service, claiming that I have an uncollected parcel. I dialled 9 to speak to the operator, who obviously is from mainland China. Sometimes, I request them to speak English, and in response, they will hang up. Other times, I ask them what do they want since they called me, and the customer service explains that it's an automated system that diverted the call to customer service. When I ask if they are based in Singapore, they say yes. When i ask to speak in English, they divert the call and hang up. I have tried calling back the number and found out it was a StarHub registered number. I do sales so it is hard for me not to answer calls which are not listed in my phonebook. However, the recent spate seems to show that China is abusing our security. Apart from creating awareness, please look into ways to alleviate the problem.
I received a call from DHL via a personal number 92461490, stating that I had sent a parcel to Beijing that was detained and needed me to call Interpol to find out. I let my guard down and continued talking as i also had a parcel from DHL incoming, so I mixed both details up. and thought the parcel I was receiving was detained After the call was transferred to Interpol, they made me say out the fake parcel number which was given by DHL, and said there were 5 fake passports in it, and told me its a serious issue and had to call the Beijing police to report, after the call was transferred for the second time, my suspicions were already confirmed. Through the conversations, I thought i could get more details from them, but the conversation was going nowhere, and I ended my call. and sent the screenshots of all the numbers to the police. nothing was lost other than my name
I needed a loan and responded to a so called legal moneylending service i received via Whatsapp. (A chinese guy who called himself william) I enquires about a $5000 loan with 12 months repayment. William told me i have to undergo a trial loan. He transferred $500 to my account on 10th jan and i have to repay $800 on 13th Jan. The additional $300 will be credited back to me once i cleared my trial loan. On 13th jan i cash deposit $800 to an UOB account he provided. However, once i did that he say i should not cash deposit and should do bank transfer instead. In order to clear my trial loan, I have to cash deposit another $800 into a Posb account. Which i stupid enough to do so. I was foolish to think its will settle and i will get my loan. After the 2nd $800 was cash deposited as instructed, william told me i need to pay $500 of processing fee. Which i did on 14th jan. Yet after that i still did not get the $5000 loan. William told me his boss ask me to pay $1000 as penalty for all the trouble. Stupid me paid and guess what.. William called again saying since i paid so much, they have upgrade my loan from $5000 to $10000. He asked for another $1000 processing fee. This time i told him i have no money to give. And i said to just stick to $5000 loan which i never receive. But he said amount already keyed into their system and he cant change. After which he get his "boss" to speak to me via watsapp voice call. The boss demanded either i pay $1000 process fee or $2500 to revert to $5000 loan. I told him i have no money and he threaten to go to my company and call my next kin. I paid $3100 without getting the loan. I had made a police report and the police only advise me to ignore them and don't give anymore money.
It happened today. I received a call and was directed to press 9 to check my DHL delivery. After I pressed 9, a Chinese guy asked my name and said that my parcel that I mailed out on 11/1/19 was been detained in Beijing because there is 5 faked passport in my parcel. I hung up my phone immediately.
Befriended via instagram then move to wechat. self-claimed as an engineer, living in austin, texas, usa. chatted for few days then started with mushy words eg: i miss you, I love you... etc. i already knew he is a scammer, just play around to see his trick. He wanted to come over to Asia to meet up and he chosen kuala lumpur instead of Singapore. he wants me to send an email to the travel agent appointed by his company, saying he needs to travel to visit his wife in Asia. At the same time, i checked to the official website and found out the website provided is not belong to the official network and the email address is fake too. the recommended posts are also copied and pasted from other website. I seent the email per the content he wanted me to write. the agent replied with a cosy apartment at bangsar, kl sentral. the funny thing is, i never mentioned the date and the duration of the travelling period and the agent asked me to pay for a month upfront of U$2050 which is similar to what the scammer told. the period can be provided after the payment is made and issued in the receipt. the bank account provided is belonged to a Malaysian Malay lady. the email was replied unprofessionally as well. it is so suspicious that how can a big company appointed such a company by transferring payment to personal account? if it is an authorised travel agent, why does the TRAVELER need to pay? Nothing was lost. the scammer got unhappy. keep PESTERING me to make the payment and he will return the money when he touches down in kuala lumpur. I refused to do that and now he said he wants to quit his job to come for me.

I knew the guy from coffee and bagels apps and I only provide my what id to him to add me (i don't like giving out my numbers). The guy who claims his name is John working as a contractor (drilling engineer) and doing a contract in Kuwait and will have a 2 yr contract in S’pore with Semcorp. He claims he is an American born Chinese, staying in Pittsburgh. After chatting with him for some time, he shared that he wished to settle down and start a family in S’pore and wanted to secure PR using his 2 yr contract with Semcorp (which I doubt this will work). In the mid-end he claimed that he supposed to be in S’pore, but there are some issues with the mud pump and trying to pay his Chinese supplier so that the mud pump can be delivered to him by cargo flight. Thereafter he mentioned he cannot get the money out because he could access the bank web due to the restriction in the Kuwait network and where he was situated (the region outskirt), he also claimed that the IT side told him that the only way for him to access the bank website is to get a 3rd party outside Kuwait to help him. He then told me that he needed to get out of Kuwait to meet me in person but he is stuck there and he cannot leave the region till he finished his contract there and got the mud pump in. He then proceeded to instruct me to visit the bank site and see whether the server work and wanted me to complete the transaction for him, he even claimed that he did this because he trusted me. I rejected his request and told him that it/s illegal to access someone else account. If he needed to do this real and urgent, he should contact his banker. If he had a big contract in Kuwait, he should have known that such a transaction required his own authorisation. Therefore, I requested him to forward me a photocopy of his passport and send me an authorised letter for a 3rd party to access the account. And I would forward them to our cybersecurity office to check on the website and make sure all are legal before I proceeded and this was when this "John" went MIA. I hope all to be alert of such, especially online scamming, never trust anyone online till you meet the real person and get along well and ask for every detail.
At first I was in need of cash to pay for my bank loan and I search online for fast cash loan and I found this "loan COMPANY" and they have an WhatsApp icon and I clicked on it and they replied me the next day asking all my details and gave it to them. At first they told me that I have to put A deposits of $800 which I didn't have and I had to borrow from friends and I did and transferred them and they told me it was my mistake And had to send a more few times until I felt that something was really wrong. I stopped the transfer as I have transferred a total of $4,300 to them and I didn't get a single cents from them and they dare to call to my work place and ask me for money. Don't borrow from unlicensed moneylender!
I received a call around noon on 10 Jan 2019. Automated voice message asked me to press "9". Then a man who could only speak Chinese answered the call and asked who i was. Identified himself as staff of DHL, saying I sent a package to Beijing. Beijing customs found a package sent in my name contained 5 fake passports. I only revealed my name in the process and hung up the call.
In November 2018, i saw a sponsored advert in facebook where the seller was selling a 3-axis stabilization gimbal from snoppa. it was priced S$60 instead of the original few hundreds. the purchase was to be paid on c.o.d term and so i thought i could easily reject it if this was a scam. when the delivery was made via ninja van, i felt the box to be extremely light for a gimbal and told the delivery-man about it. he said that his role was to just make deliveries. if i have any issue, i should contact his office. so i just received the package and true enough the item was just a piece of cheap plastic selfie-stick which probably cost around $2-$5. though i know it was futile, i wrote to ninja van and they told us to contact the seller for a refund. after an initial niceties with the seller, they stop responding to me. their strategy is simply to make a false advert through facebook with an IRRESISTIBLE offer and cash-on-delivery offer only so that there is no way to recover the amount paid. one month later, i saw another similar advert in facebook but for another product sold by a person called "linna" showing photos of the boxes of dji osmo mobile purportedly ordered by her in bulk. i asked linna if the item is not what was advertised, could i reject the delivery but she did not respond. later on, i found out that she has deleted my posts and prohibit me from further posting. i purposely wrote to her about the rejection of item on delivery so that i could hint to other users - many of them have placed their orders - not to fall into this scam.
I was watching instA stories and the advertisement about hair DrYer so I thought it Is reliable since iT is advertised from instagram so i bought it. But i was relUctant to pay fOr it since Payment oN delivEry. So the delivery company keePEd contact me to deliver the parcel. Once i got it. It is a hair DRYer which is totally different from itS advertised. Anyway, i have been trIed to contact the company for refund and no reSpond from phOne call it Is given And no rePly from email as WeLl.
An automatic call to me told me (in Chinese) that my emergent delivery failed, and click 0 to talk to staff. She first asked my name and i told them (the only information disclosed so far). she THEN TOLD ME THAT I delivered a passport to a guy called lin hua in Beijing, but address failed. after i told her i didn't deliver anything and my passports are with me, she told me that she would contact her company first and let me wait for further instruction. i have newly got my phone number on Jan 4th, but she said my delivery started from Jan 2nd. So i couldn't possibly disclosed my phone number to let others impersonate and delivery anything, it must be random call of scam. probably because i used shun Feng service before that let my guard down.
My name is Suganth from India and working as an Engineer in one of the reputed company in Singapore. I got a call from the number +65 62382538 and they told the call is from high commission of India. They said, I have given the wrong information regarding my date of birth and it's a series offence in Singapore and I'm going to be arrested soon for the crime. And also they threatened they will inform to the employer and I will be deported immediately. To avoid these criminal charges they asked me to pay S$10K as a fine. I had a doubt regarding the call and I contacted the Singapore police department for help and they confirmed it's a scam call. How i found its a scam call 1. Government never call people like this, i believe they will contact via official letter which will be posted to the registered address. 2. Government ( especially Singapore government ) never threaten people like this. 3. Initially scammer told me I'm going to arrested and later he threaten he will not do that if i pay the money he asks. I'm pretty sure government will not do this. Singapore is a nice and safe place to like. So people don't fall into this kind of traps. Just ignore call from the scammers and inform to Singapore officials. Hope this helps.
The email appeared in my school email's spam folder. I only opened the email a few days after it was sent. The email claimed that an email was sent from my account to myself, therefore the sender has full access to my email account. It also mentioned that a Trojan Virus through an adult site gives the sender access and control of my devices over a computer and that he is able to see everything on the screen, microphone or camera. It then demanded that I transfer $782 to his Bitcoin account, otherwise supposed embarrassing footage of me will be released to all emails and contacts on social networks. I did some checking and found out that it was actually a Sextortion scam (https://www.spamtitan.com/blog/new-sextortion-scam-emails-sent-users-email-account/). The Bitcoin account mentioned in the email was also heavily reported in a Bitcoin Abuse Database (https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports/18QtUZKEsuY9gvviSsZCweyPRLSDndU6Xu?page=5). Hope the public can be more aware of such scams and prevent themselves from falling for it.

Entered the tenanted apartment 5 days after handover on 28 Dec 2018 and discovered furnishings worth $XX,000 have been removed! Tenant's CEA registered agent is also un-contactable now.

I recently bought from taobao on 4 Dec 2018 and had been waiting for weeks, contact taobao sea shipping to find out the delivery is from last mile delivery pte ltd. I tried to call last mile delivery but not able to provide me exact date of delivery. so I have been waiting for phone calls, and all these phone calls or scams. for your info, I saw +6783961839 but did not pick up. the other numbers look like local Singapore numbers which I thought are from delivery man, so I picked up. 88315953 is the only one which I foolishly thought it was from delivery company and gave the taobao assignment number (the information I provided) because he called me by my surname which I thought is delivery man so I asked for parcel status. after a while, the guy told me my parcel is held at changi airport because it was detected to have 5 illegal items, the guy told me that it will be sent back to Beijing, and I cut the line because it sounded ridiculous. I have currently received 2 out of 3 of my taobao parcels.

I got to know a guy from coffee and bagel and his name is John Chang Brown. He claimed to be an US citizen, only child and parents have passed away. His mother is from Singapore and dad from Albania. He said he is a drilling engineer working as an contractor for KNPC and is at Kuwait oil rig now. he cannot video call as the internet connection is bad at Kuwait. he does not have an us accent though he moved to us at 12 years old. his spelling is sometimes worse than me. he said he was divorced and his ex-wife cheated on him when he was overseas working. He claimed to be in love with me and will relocate to Singapore after his project ends. when we talked, he told me that his machine pump is not working well and he needs to get a new pump. he even told me that knpc came to inspect and he has received money for the 1st milestone for the project. He started to ask me to help him on 3 Dec as he cannot access his bank account as it is blocked due to IT security issues. He gave me the link http://firstcititrust.com, account code and password and asked me to transfer money to a China vendor as he needs to buy a machine pump. I could access the account and see that there was money credited into his account from KNPC as 1st instalment payment for his project (USD750k). But the money cannot be transferred out to the vendor as there was an income tax to be paid. He also asked me to contact the bank staff on his behalf regarding the account restriction and ask for instructions on how to pay for the income tax. I contacted the bank based on the email given in the error message when the payment was blocked, and it also matched the email address in the bank website. i blocked him when he asked me to help to pay for the income tax. I think this is an syndicate as the bank website was done professionally. when I went to check the bank website again, it was down and I realised that the real bank is first city trust not first citi trust.

Saw a deal on Instagram ad for a mobile device. Took an interest so I ordered it. What came wasn't even as imitation of the original product.
On 25th november 2018, i was browsing through a facebook group "sg online shopping" and chanced upon a post made by a user named "anna wong". the user was advertising some clothing for sales and i expressed interest by messaging her on facebook messenger. thereafter, i was instructed by her to pay a total amount of sgd$20 to preorder 2 pieces of clothing. she informed me that the clothing would only arrive in between the period of mid december 2018. my daughter then used her posb account to transfer her the amount of $20. a day before collection, i realised that anna wong has blocked me on facebook and took down her facebook page. I felt that something was amiss but decided to go forth with the meetup as per scheduled. on the day of collection, i headed down to punggol interchange at 10.30am and waited for anna wong. however, she failed to appear even after 30 minutes of wait. at that moment, i realised that i was scammed. i went onto facebook and wrote a post to warm my friends of this scammer so that they wouldn't fall for the same trap. on top of that, i posted on another facebook seller's selling page to warn like-minded buyers of the scam situation. the seller was very sympathetic of my situation and shared my experience to her viewers. through the sharing session, i found out that there are other buyers who are also in the same situation as me.

Clicked on a website and a virus warning popped up in July 2017. A security warning popped up and got a call to access some website and they controlled my laptop and convinced me to pay $199.99 for a security plan to Avoid the virus from corrupting my laptop. Today they called me multiple times and tried to pull the same trick and asked me to pay USD 999.99 for a renewed subscription I did not sign up for. I sensed something amiss and googled the company's name and found out they are a scam, based on local news last year. So I hung up and closed my laptop.

Caller call my hp on 19/12/2018 afternoon. He asked me if i need to loan money. I asked him where he got my number. He said his boss gave him a list to call. He asked more things but i cant hear him clearly so i said "no" &amp; hang up the call. So i wonder if police can help to trace the owner of this hp number (local +65) &amp; find out how he got the list of numbers. How do i alert the police or which agency can further help on this tracing? There are also few whats app message from overseas numbers offering loan.
I was looking for a room to rent and i made contact with the "landlord" on easyroomate.com. Things progressed quickly, with him asking me for personal information regarding the rental etc. I was alright to provide it. But strangely, i felt that he kept repeating himself in the messages because i had already answered the questions! i felt that it was strange because it seemed like he didn't actually read my replies and was giving me canned responses. despite me asking to view the room, he didn't arrange for one and said that the current tenant was away for christmas and her mum was sick so he didn't when she'll be back. also, he said he didn't have a local bank account because it was undergoing 'linking' with his bank account in london. i know that's rubbish because there's no need to 'link' bank accounts. the most important details was how he kept pressing me for the rental deposit of 1000 and upfront 2 months rent. i said i'm alright to pay for it and said that i need to set up a recurrent billing with my citibank account and i will need his bank account details and rental contract. the rental contract came. it seemed to be done up on ms word with poor margins and clipart and the watermark confidential all over it. there is no attorney address or third party signature. there is no mention of landlord's nationality, passport number/ic number etc. the address of the home is generic and does not have a unit number. there are lots of clauses which talk about late payment charges and trying to make it seem very official, however, the language use is quite poor if it were really written by a lawyer. when i made objections, he wasn't happy to provide more details. the bank account he gave me was an account in the UK. no local bank account, no local representative and there was an obvious rush for me to transfer the money to him and a lot pressure for me to provide a receipt. the strangest thing is the name of the account holder. the account is registered to a man called 'innocent aloye'. when i searched it up, there is no such person to have passed the bar in london. i am glad that i asked all the right questions. this guy wasn't able to answer them and i quickly realised that it was a scam. please be aware of such scams as the pictures provided and the rental cost is very attractive. people who have been looking for rooms for a long time will feel like its the perfect place for them and will rush to put a deposit down to secure it.
I RECEIVED a call this morning in chinese language asking me to bring my iC and other identification documents down to the nearest police station. Although it is a very old case, it still pays to be cautious. luckily i was alert enough not to follow the INSTRUCTIONS of the caller and quickly hung up. this is most likely an police impersonation scam. i was also asked to press 1 on my phone to find out more about the ALLEGED police case against me.
ON DECEMBER 11, I WENT ON TWITTER TO LOOK FOR 1 BTS CAT 1 YELLOW TICKET, AND FOUND THIS PERSON (@TAEBORNSLAY) WHO POSTED A TWEET THAT SHE WAS SELLING 1 TICKET. ON THAT VERY SAME DAY, I MESSAGED HER FOR THE PRICE, AND QUICKLY ACCEPTED THE OFFER. SHE THEN TOLD ME IT WAS AN E TICKET BUT SHE COULD EXCHANGE IT TO A PHYSICAL TICKET. I OFFERED TO GO DOWN TO THE SINGAPORE INDOOR STADIUM BOX OFFICE WITH HER TO CHANGE THE TICKETS, AND SHE SAID OKAY. WE SCHEDULED TO MEET ON DECEMBER 18, AS SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS ONLY GOING TO BE IN SINGAPORE FROM DECEMBER 17 ONWARDS. SHE THEN TOLD ME PAYING CASH IN PERSON WOULD BE FINE BUT SHE REQUIRED A $100 DEPOSIT, SO SHE GAVE ME HER EMAIL AND I TRANSFERRED THE MONEY OVER. WE DECIDED TO MEET AT 10AM ON DECEMBER 18 AT SINGAPORE INDOOR STADIUM BOX OFFICE, AND SHE SAID SHE HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE AFTER AND NOT TO BE LATE. ON DECEMBER 15, SHE POSTED TWO NEW TWEETS ON HER ACCOUNT ABOUT SELLING THE VERY SAME TICKET I WAS BUYING. THIS TRIGGERED MY SUSPICIONS SO I MESSAGED HER ASKING IF THE TICKET WAS RESERVED FOR ME. SHE REPLIED YES SO I SAID OKAY. ON DECEMBER 17, I MESSAGED HER TO SAYING I WILL SEE HER AT 10AM AT THE TICKETING COUNTER. SHE DID NOT REPLY. ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 17, I ASKED FOR HER CONTACT NUMBER. AGAIN, SHE DID NOT REPLY. ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 18 (OUR MEET UP DAY), I TOLD HER WHAT I WOULD BE WEARING. SHE DID NOT REPLY. WHEN I WENT TO THE SINGAPORE INDOOR STADIUM TICKETING COUNTER AT 10AM ON DECEMBER 18, THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON WAITING TO PASS ME TICKETS. I LOOKED AROUND AND WAITED A LITTLE MORE BUT STILL NOTHING. IN HINDSIGHT, MY STUPIDITY PLAYED A ROLE IN ME BEING SCAMMED BECAUSE I DID NOT ASK TO SEE AN E TICKET PROOF AND JUST BLINDLY PAID A DEPOSIT FIRST. REGARDLESS, STAY AWAY FROM TAEBORNSLAY AND ANYONE OFFERING YOU BELOW $400 FOR TICKETS.

i got to know this korean guy by the name of Hyun jun smith / hyŎn jun on IG around Sep 2018. after a few chat, he suggested to chat on whatsapp &amp; so we exchanged no. he claimed that he's working for the royal dutch (shell) as a drilling supervisor. he claimed that he has a son &amp; his wife has passed away when his son was still small. he's looking for a stepmum to take care of his son. after a week, he started to express his feelings for me &amp; said that i will be the right mum &amp; a good wife. at first, i rejected but when i saw his photo on IG and the photos that he send to me taken together with his son and elderly mum look so real so i decided to accept him. after weeks of chatting, he claimed that he has won a contract from exxon mobil &amp; he'll be going to north sea for 1 month. afterwhich, he will come to singapore to visit and propose to me. shortly, things started to happen. on Nov 2018, when he started his offshore contract, he claimed that his son has been hospitalised and need money £1200 to pay the hospital but his account has been hold by his company so he's unable to pay the hospital. he wanted me to transfer 1st &amp; he will pay me back. if not, his son will not be able to discharge. when i told him that i have no money, he started to say that he's sick &amp; he himself has been admiited to hospital &amp; even send me a pic of a needle that was inserted into his hand so i decided to help him. we still chat as normal. he said that he's rushing for the contract so he can come early to visit me. this 2nd time around 2nd week of Dec 2018, he said he needed £1700 to pay for the filing of the documents. i rejected him again but he said since the project has finished so there's no point for him &amp; his coworkers to stay there anymore. again, i helped him. from then, i started to get suspicious of him. 3rd time, he claimed that the daughter of 1 of his coworker has a fall and is in a coma state. due to his account not released yet, he has no money to pay the balance payment to the coworker so he asked me to help again. this time, i strongly rejected him by saying that i have no money at all. he will pretend to be stress and keep saying that the coworker keep texting him till he can't get to sleep. when the time come to pay me back, he blocked me from whatsapp and even deleted his IG account. however, his pic is still there. His IG account hyun_jun_smith45
Received a phone call from a local mobile number &amp; was told that I’ve missed answering a call regarding the delivery of my parcel. I was told to press a no. to settle it. As it was all spoken in Chinese, I thought it’s a Chinese delivery company regarding my recent purchases on line. I really thank God for His protection. When I spoke to the guy, he said his Dept doesn’t handle this issue &amp; when he asked for my name I asked him for his name first. Then I confirmed with him the name of his company is not what I thought “EHL” but actually is the well known “DHL”. And I asked for his number, he gave me his name, company no. &amp; his extension no. So I told him I’ll check first as I’m worried that this might be a scam. So I put down the phone &amp; called the no he gave which turned out to be actually DHL. But there’s no such extension &amp; the staff there told me it’s a scam &amp; that as long as I didn’t disclose any info I’m alright. But still I’m not comfortable about it &amp; Im worried whether I should make a report to the police..

They are having no options after that, they scolded me and they said you are not following the protocols. i said i will come in person and asked for the contact person to meet. They just put down the phone after that. Again received the call after 5 mins, i said i will come to ICA building directly just put down the phone. i called 999 and also the anti-scam helpline 18007226688 and reported about this. They confirmed it is a scam and requested me to spread this with friends and families. I didn't loose any money, but my passport number and dependent pass number i have shared with them. Please beware.

Recently , 6 months ago we moved to singapore as my husband had an OPPORTUNITY to work here. last month, I received a call from the number 64385121 saying that he is calling from the ica department and mentioned that I have committed some office in my country(india), they have asked the ica department to take an action on me in singapore. he asked me a few questions like how long i am in singapore. I answered. later he asked me to take out documents like passport, dp card etc . then, i realized that it might be a prank and said i cannot reveal my info over phone. if required i can come to the ica building and provide the details. he then disconnected. I called the SCAM HELPLINE to enquire and they confirmed that it was a spam call and noted down the number from which i received this call. they also ADVISED me not to take this call as they might ask me to pay money to help me tackle this situation. again last monday(5th dec, 2018), I received this call.

I did not attend. though i am completely aware that this is a spam call , I wanted to bring it to your notice so that he will not cheat anyone else. thanking you, arthee raghunathan
We knew one another through tantan app. We contacted via WhatsApp. He mentioned he is a Korean staying in UK working as a pilot in the British airline. After knowing him for a month, he stated he is sending me a parcel but I need to pay clearance fee. Obviously this is a scam and I gave him an empty non existence address. Finally, the courier company called demont courier service company approached me via WhatsApp asking me to pay $2.6k before releasing the parcel to me. The courier company initially do not want to release my address information. After my confrontation, it was released but it is a wrong address! And further confrontation made the communication stopped as the scammer realised I am not an easy person to scam for. Demont courier is a famous scam on social media. And joowon WILSON of course is IN a cahoot with this courier company. Made friends who are reliable, existed and trustworthy. I already knew he is a scammer so I go into a further conversation with him to drill out more of his real intentions and preventing more people from falling into his scam traps.

I got a call at 10:40 A.M. on 3-Dec-2018 and the person(Male) on the other side claimed to be an immigration officer. he was harsh and constantly yelling for no reason. he seems to threaten saying 'Do you know what it is to get a call from immigration office' and demanded me to listen carefully. I GOT SUSPICIOUS and asked him to call me after office hours without providing any details (again harsh BEHAVIOR) so that i can gather information if this is genuine. It turns out it was fake call. will update information if he calls back. i was wondering how he knows my name though?
Today morning got a call from this number and a person claimed to be calling from immigration department. He was threatening that i will be deported to my home country. once i asked his name and told him that i am not buying his story, he immediately ended the call. I wonder how he knew my name - perhaps truecaller app.
The scammer had introduced itself as a girl. She did send photos of her. And one day she telling me that she is gonna visit malaysia and stay for one month.. Then after that passes few days, she send me the air ticket confirmation photo receipt to me telling me she already do the flight booking. After for sometime she suddenly ask for personal details which is name and address claiming that she wanted to send over her things or belongings over to me first, so i help her to keep before she arrives in kuala lumpur.. And says that she had to take many many things so only she wanted to courier to me some of her things first.. And that moment only i realize she some kinda scammer or whatever that wanted to scam over me. But from there i straight and direct clearly knowing that she is lying and wanted to do fraud on me. But luckily,from there i realized and so i did not give any of my info to that person. I keep on replying delaying her saying that i will send it later.. but then she is keep saying asking me to send her as quick as possible. Saying she will need to go to post office before lunch and saying it would be late to send her things cause she claiming that she will arrive at Kuala Lumpur at December 1st 2018.
My mom came into my room and told me she had met a guy via facebook. They were chatting on Whatsapp after that. She said the guy is a from Hongkong - an oil rig engineer in Cyprus called "eni/kogas" and has a daughter ('somewhere'). He is thinking of retiring n has plans to do investments in sg, but unsure what kind of investments he should do. My mom then told me that the guy would be coming to SG to visit her. I smelt a rat - Immediately knew it was a love scam! So i went to dig further, Found out it was a Nigeria scam - thru his facebook, called, "Ben Kun" - n told her after that.
A person impersonated that he is an ICA officer and saying that i have offended a crime in the past.
Here is Facebook ADVERTISEMENT, which will lure you to buy the product, advertisement will show the comparison, feature, video and all possible element to win your confidence. they will table the offer at price point which is Big trap (shall be first sign we shall be CONSCIOUS of). Most important element, they will mention cash on delivery, hence we will feel least risk to get the product, but this is the trap and beware of this. Unfortunately i ordered this product and i got the message for "Ninja Van" with secure code to share at the time of delivery. you feel confident that delivery is secure - it is another trap you are getting into. Finally Ninja van will show up on your door and will hand over a sealed packed and demand cash. they will caution you if you open the packet it is consider receipt of delivery hence you are obligated to pay money. however if you do not open, you will establish the facts of fraud later. i got trapped and my wife (at home) paid the amount, however after opening the packet, i REALIZED that product is nowhere close what was advertised. hence i called immediately ninja van team and told them that the product is fake. There are many customers who have received the same packet and reached out to "Ninja Van team" to ensure their cash is not paid to seller and they shall be able to protect customer from this fraud. but they flatly refused me &amp; others and informed me that as soon as i signed the delivery slip they remitted the money to seller. Hence, I asked them to share the details of seller name, account number and requested them to raise the matter and inform local AUTHORITIES. there did not share any details nor shown any concern about the money lost by multiple customers, which made me believe they are either part of fraud or may be creator of fraud. how can a company send instant payment to an unknown seller and that to INSTANTANEOUSLY, hard to digest this. Here are the symptoms you must check: 1. Great price deal - Check reputation of online seller 2. These website will not send you confirmation mail or will send you confirmation mail from alias with "not-to-reply" without any real contact details. 2.

I met a guy on Instagram 3 weeks ago, claiming he wants to be Friends. His english is not perfect, but we can UNDERSTAND each other. He persuaded me to give him my number to add on WhatsApp because he is not allowed to use other social media during working Hours. He CLAIMED he is from us, lost his dad when he was young, and is working alone as an engineer (shells petrol) in Manchester, UK. He had a bad experience as his ex-girlfriend was found sleeping with his best friend. on WhatsApp, he showed a lot of love and care, telling me constantly that he loves me and wants to marry me, and that his mom WANTS him to get married. He sends selfies of HIMSELF occasionally, and he is GOOD-looking a real charmer and sweet-talker. He claims that he will come to Singapore to see me during his vacation, and he is very positive that fate Brought us together, and very positive that we will be together. After three weeks, he suddenly mentioned that he is trying to get a very important contract, and asked me to pray for him. After that, he came back telling me That he got the contract, and is very happy and he believes that he got the contract because of me being in his life. He said that he will work offshore at London seaport for 3 weeks, then he will come to Singapore to meet me. He then told me that he bought things for me to send it to me via courier. When I refused, he said I'm preventing him from going for his contract. In the end, I gave him my home address and email address. The next day, he told me he has SENT the parcel to me, and I'll Receive it in a few days. He added on that he kept a brown envelope of 10.5K pounds inside the parcel, which I'll be able to find after removing the items that he bought me. I panicked as IT is not right to take money from a stranger For no reason at all, what's more it's such a big sum. I also realized that it is not allowed to send cash in parcels. I texted to tell him I do not accept The money, but he KEEPS telling me That I am breaking his heart and he is doing this out of his Love for me. When I asked for the Courier that he used, he gave me an email address, saying that he uses it very often and he trusts THEM when I queried on the reliability. Eventually I googled the email address and found multiple accounts of scams with similar story plots, and then I realized this is probably a love scam, whereby soon the Courier will call me to ask for money. I confronted him, but he claims he is not a scammer. I blocked him after that.

On 19oct’18, My mum received a home call from a guy stated he’s from singtel. So my mum said he will call my handphone. I didn’t know that my mum gave my Phone number to him until lately she told me so. I Often received the same phone number on my missed call. So When i tried to call back,the line Was always busy. Apparently, the guy who claimed he was from singtel successfully called me. He’s offering a recordable set-top box at $2.45 a month after new subscription. He claimed his name was michael but he sounds like Filipino accent. He talked on a speaker phone. Although i’ve said earlier i don’t watch tv so often eventually i agreed to his Offers. He said he will send down the item on 24th Oct but didn’t turn up. I called Singtel to verify. But Via singtel call was so difficult to get in touch with the operator so i just checked online if there’s any hold up bill, it’s none. So that’s how i thought i was scammed. The guy had my details like home address, iC number &amp; phone number.

I placed order and text received from "ninjavan" claimed be their delivery guy on the said schedule &amp; time. the package was delivered with full wrapping materials to my door step, after opened up the wrapping and realize that the item was not genunie and completely a fake dji product even thought it is functioning with just a few oridinary drone features. i decided to go with my refund and contacted them via their online chats/ emails for several days but no response. then after i realize it was a scam. logged a police case thereafter..
This guy added me on FB and purportedly name as ALVIN CHEUNG and claimed himself as AMERICAN BORN CHINESE. He claimed himself as DIRECTOR OF OFFSHORE DIAMOND COMPANY, living in LOS ANGELES. HE SPEAKS ENGLISH BUT CANNOT UNDERSTAND COMPLICATED ENGLISH. DUE to his nature of work HE IS ALWAYS ON THE SHIP AND he cannot use FACEBOOK AND He requested for WhatsApp. HE WILL often CALL ME ON WHATSAPP CALL BUT HE ONLY UNDERSTANDS VERY SIMPLE ENGLISH. HE STARTS ASKING ABOUT ME AND LATER SAYS I LOVE YOU AND START SWEET TALKING TO ME. He says he wants to start a life and do some real estate investment and asks if I could ask for pricing from a few real estate agents and we will split the profit. I agreed he said he will transfer me the money At a later time. A few days of conversation, he said he HAD SEND ME SOME gifts AS SURPRISE AND will send it to me by courier. A few days pass and he told me the parcel is stuck in Malaysia. He later revealed that the courier company is demanding a ransom money and that he put 1 million dollars inside the parcel. The money he promised that he will send me to do property investment. The courier company which I later found out was fake wanted me to send 50,000 so that they can release the parcel. I transferred the money to the courier company BUT the parcel never came. When I called them they said there was no such company and the ransom message was fake and there was no such person who provided me the Malaysian bank account. I was angry and I asked him to return me my money. He kept saying "relax honey, I will give you back your money." A few weeks later, He said he will come to meet me in SINGAPORE when his ship reach Singapore he will pass me the money. He told me when he Will meet me on a certain day and time. But last minute he said his mother fell sick and he had to fly back to USA. A few weeks later, he kept saying that he will return me my money but he never did. Suddenly he said he had a lawsuit and needed money for lawsuit and wanted me to transfer 1500 to his lawyer. This was when I realised I may have been scammed. I called him to return my money and he KEPt saying that he will and he kept sweet talking to me. Finally I realised that I may have BEEN scammed. I asked him for his passport and he sent it to me. My friend then told me that the passport looks fake. that was when I realised I have been scammed.

Met eugene yeo(jiedong yeo) from okcupid.com. I know him for half an year. So when he said he didn't bring enough ￥ in cku competiton , and the dog show can't accept credit card to pay, then requested me to borrow him ￥20000, I lent 6000. But after the show, he deleted me from Wechat, didn't pay back. I have sent friend request to ask him, he blocked me. As I known, he has enough money, but he just wants to scam money from others. Guess he covers well in Singapore .
Buyer messaged me showing interest in my items (iPhone). then ask me what other items i am selling. then ask for best price. then claims that "getting it for my daughter for a birthday gift which is tomorrow", "she will be traveling to camp by tomorrow", not available to meet up as working offshore", "arrange with the courier for COLLECTION", "bank of america receipt", "account statement". When things fails, he will say things like "you want problems", i am ready for you", i have all your details". Seems like he know Malaysia import tax very well, he will teach you what to write and what to say. he will rush you to send the items before you are able to check your bank account balance (as banks requires 2-4 days). he will send you screenshot of a poorly edited transaction receipt and account statement. 2) November 2018 3) Lost $80 for shipping fees, COURIER managed to stop and return the items to me.
Befriended via instagram then move to wechat. claimed as american born chinese, raised in ohio by single mom, graduated in mbbs, works as a doctor and lives in london. he works in a hospital in southall but not able to mention the name of the hospital. He said he left his ex-girlfriend not long ago because he found out the girl was sleeping with his friend and got pregnant. after chatting for few weeks, he said he FELLED in love with me and started all the sweet talk. then he said he got a contract from the hospital to send him to turkey for project with crews. start to seek for help in the second week in turkey as his credit card was hacked. refused to seek help from family, friends and hospital but insisted want me to transfer money to him. got angry when i refused to do so. blocked me from instagram and wechat after a week. A very handsome looking guy. HE USED TO SEND A LOT OF PICTURES OF HIMSELF. eventually found loopholes as he said the photo was taken in turkey but the background was exactly the same with the picture he said he took at home in london. wechat id: kenwong1414 instagram: kenwong2979
Got an automated call from dhl singapore and press "9" to talk to someone. he said i sent a parcel to beijing and it is being held in china due to contraband items and i told him i did not send it and he suggested i make a report to the chinese police because immigration might detain me if i leave the country and i can check what item it was then he transferred my call over. talked to the chinese interpol for almost 3 hours. He got my name, passport number, phone number (from the call) and home address. I was legit convinced because he made it seem so real. anyway, the parcel was a stack of fake passport. then, he filed a report for me with my statement. then, another issue came out- apparently, i was involved in money laundering and is helping this guy (Yan zheng dong), and i have a chinese bank account with money in it, and the "guy" im helping is caught and saying all 136 of us assisted him in this crime. he said not to tell anyone, and i'll have to give him a call 4 times a day to check that i did not ghost him (because he stuck up for me to his boss). he even whatsapp me an arrest warrant. he said i need to prepare &amp; hope for the best or i'll be sent to the chinese jail and have to stay there till they prove my innocence (the part where he called his supervisor to apply for some document to put me at the top of the list of the people caught and that my report will be reviewed first &amp; said he trusts me &amp; he put his job on the line for me). i know it sounds crazy reading this but it sure feels real if you are the one receiving the call. anyway, after the phone call, did my google research &amp; found some similar stories &amp; immediately reported to the police. i can't believe i wasted 3 hours entertaining him.
Website is offering clothes at first glance but also has sub-sites to promote electronic gadgets, in my case a Nebula video projector. I should have been suspicious about the cheap price to begin with but somehow still signed up for one piece. Address and contact details were asked on the website, however no payment details. Just cash on delivery. I haven't heard anything until 2 weeks later a delivery company in Singapore Ninja Van called to deliver a parcel. Cash payment was done to the driver in exchange for the parcel. Only after opening I realized that a total other product was inside. A cheap PC speaker worth pretty much nothing. When I called the delivery co to return the product they said once the driver marks the item as delivered automatically the sender receives the money from them and there is no way to stop this or recall the funds. Going back to the seller website obviously no real contact details could be found and just a fake return policy page.
Similar to many others reported on this website, I WAS LED TO believe that i had an parcel with illegal contents at Shanghai pudong airport being investigated by shanghai interpol. i disclosed my FULL name and Nric but ended the call when i realized that it was probably a scam.
Recieved a call from +6562563281 at 9.13am on 16 nov 2018, at first it sounded like a legit automated voice system informing of an unclaimed parcel from singpost asking to press ‘2’ to be re-directed to a singpost customer service operator. After holding for about 5 seconds, an operator (malay male local Sounding) picked up and said “good morning singpost customer service, how may i assist you today?” I tried to enquire about the unclaimed parcel and he asked for my full name to check in the system. He replied that theres no information found and followed with asking for my nric number. After checking my nric, he said that i have a parcel from shanghai pudong withheld by shanghai customs containing illegal contents and told me to contact relavant authorities immediately to rectify the issue. I realised from this point onward that its a scam and hung up immediately.
We write to flag a scam using the name of a Singapore company Asia Pacific Investment Pte Ltd (“APIPL”). The perpetrators operate under the name “Asia Pacific Investment Pte Limited” and have created a website www.asiapacificpte.com (see enclosed screen shot) which uses the company registration number and registered office address of the actual company – see http://www.asiapacificpte.com/contact.html. The website (http://www.asiapacificpte.com/management-board.html) shows a list of individuals as being the “Management Team”. None of these individuals are actual employees of APIPL. From the website, it appears that the perpetrators are offering investment products and venture capital financing. APIPL does not offer such products or financing. We have lodged a police report on this matter already. We wish to warn all members of the public to exercise caution in dealing with this matter. Please note that the specific website details may change. The present contents of the website were previously hosted at a different website address (www.asiapacificinv.com). That website has since been taken down (and the new website emerged thereafter).
Befriended him on tinder and move on to chat on WhatsApp. He requested for me to switch to kakao talk after a few days of chat with chat id of seanlee018. He claimed that he's a pilot flying with American airlines. However, in the photo that he sent he wears a flight safety uniform. Which arose my suspicion and I started to Google about this and found that there is a similar scam on this web. He said that he will be flying to China for interview with southern airlines and will be flying over to meet me. This did not happen as I had busted his story before he manage to scam me. He said that I've hurt him by checking on him.
He befriended me via LINKEDIN AND HAD MOVED ON TO WHATSAPP CHAT WITH ME. HE SAID HE WORKED IN THE OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRY FOR MARathon Petroleum and have been awarded a 1 million project at Turkey, black sea. The project will only requires one month of his time and he will that relocate to Singapore. Subsequently he said that he faces some issue with the orders that he had made and requested for my help as his bank account was suspended. He asked to transfer $15,000 to him. So ladies please beware.
I recently wanted to sell my Coach Wallet ONLINE amounting to $450 and was almost scammed on the pretext of using Citibank's name to send me the confirmation order. He said he is in the US and wanted to buy this gift for his daughter in China. So he had transferred the money to my bank account however, after which I receive an email from Citibank Group USA stating that I need to ship the item and provide them the tracking number for the buyer's money to go through and to be credited into my account. However later when I googled the email address it was: customerconsultantdept@usa.com which I believe Citibank would have a citi.com and saw many online blogs and reviews on people who also got scammed/ almost scammed by this pretext, same method. This person is using the established name of Citibank to scam people with fake confirmation orders and apparently this has been happening to many. I would like to bring this to your attention and I did email Citibank in USA AND CITIBANK SINGAPORE. I think banks need to tighten their security in online orders especially in verifying the confirmation order are indeed from the bank itself. I am not sure why I received "Citibank's" confirmation order. Should there be any confirmation order by the banks, I think there needs to be some sort of verification to prove they are indeed from the bank itself. Thankfully I did not ship my item otherwise would have lost a very expensive item. Thank you!

I did not lose information and money. Thanks God.
I was looking for a dog to adopt and this person had placed ads up for a couple of Shiba inus. I contacted them and they said that the dogs themselves were free since they were up for adoption and only cared about giving them a good home. The $500 charge was only for the delivery fee from Ukraine to Singapore. After some exchanging of personal information like our home address, I was told to wait until the animal importing agency contacted me through email. Everything seemed okay and believable until I got the email from "skypetz@mail.com". The giveaway clue was that the documents looked very unprofessional. I got suspicious and went to look up the "Sky Petz" and although they were a legitimate agency, their offical email was "skypetzrelocation@gmail.com". I then turned down the persons offer and they threatened to sue me in court but I stood my ground because they have no basis.

I'm financially hurt but the hurt which he hurt my heart and feeling is more then the money i want to warn woman not to get involved with him.
During my job search a woman contacted me and asked if I was interested in being a purchase Agent. She (Teri White) said they would use my credit cards during the "probation period". She offered a big salary and bonuses a laptop and cell phone. She gave me a bank account number and I was to pay off my credit cards with it and use those cards to buy with untell the full hire was complete. I varified that the card was paid down and now I was to buy . They gave exact instructions-iphones, tool. Then I shipped and advanced the TN. Each time the payment varified. Then the payments got reversed and I was left holding the bag. I talked around and another guy lost $200K this same way and BofA is trying to prosecute him as if he was a part of the scam not a victim, a real nightmare.

It was a night of August 2018 when I read a novel type letter from the scammer. I thought that was a friendly letter and it made me feel like my high school years. Suddenly, I did not know I am being taken little by little. It came to the point he was able to established friendship. I know that his goal is to take on a next level. He picked the sweetest words more than you will ever know. Afterwards, there came a time he said that they are been chase by pirates in the sea. He said he needs my assistance and he needs to send his valuables to me. So, I gave him my information. A day after, someone from fake Customs texted me to claim his luggage. I need to make a phone call to get his luggage. I got back with him and he got mad. He said that I had caused pain. All of a sudden he deactivated his account. Now he is back. Same format. Same Letter. Beware of KELLY DESMOND
Get to know him from dating app n managed to meet up.Within the wk of dating,he started to ask for money due to creating story of borrowing money from loan shark n that time I'm totally love blind n trusted his words.But main purpose of borrowing out the money was still wish he will change by nt borrowing loan shark anymore. With this kind-hearted mindset end up shown that he is a scammer,when I started to chase back my money after a wk when I suggested to stop seeing each other as he makes me feel so insecure of keeping lot of secrets of himself than telling me more about him. At first still manage to get back reply by all his fake promises of returning back money but dragging for months n even started to say he lost his job n hand tight can't return money,all these sort of excuses make a clear point of me being scammed n he started to go missing in action as time passed. So I only can take this as a lesson even how hurt it was,do not make a police report mainly do not want to let my parent worry.I lost S$1.2K due to this scam...Hope n wish no one will get scam by this scammer in future!

Saw an Samsung Note 9 for sale at a good price ($750) and contacted seller via Whatsapp. Seller claims to be from SALAMFONE MOBILE LIMITED. Was told to transfer money over to him/her when requested to meet items and check items beforehand. The reason being so is that Item was at warehouse. After transferring money to him/her via atm, I received a mail from Portsman Logistics indicating that I will have to pay a ridiculous fee of $400 to secure the phone's release from "customs" as it is being held in Changi Airport Departure Lounge Terminal (KLIA) international airport . A police report has been made on this and seller has close down his/her carousell account. Any attempts to contact him/her has met with no response.

I was invited to an property show in Hong kong in oct 2016 organised by Event Clinic an Singapore based company. where was introduced to then AGM of Ozone Group who offered apartment at 90% value. In dec 2016 I was allotted 2apartments both in Ozone Urbana Avenue project bangalore. For which I had to pay 10% booking &amp; avail 80% loan through their provided option of India bulls (IHFL) and disburse loan on Pre -emi (2 yrs) total loan period 10 yrs. We did sign documents for sells agreement, construction agreement, tripartite agreement &amp; buy back agreement. The builder Ozone group was suppose provide possession of the apartment in Aug 2018. Under the buy back agreement option at 18 month I had opted not to retain &amp; at 24th month Ozone group to close the loan on my behalf with IHFL &amp; provide the 10% booking + 10% profit. But after RERA was introduced they changed the possession date to dec 2020 without prior intimation. Currently indirectly they have threatening to encash the cheques provided &amp; process ecs linked to account by India bulls to declare me bankcrupt.

Recently, I have been trying to seek some old furniture on the carousell. Rather to my surprise, the responses I received were quite good. The responses were mostly from different usernames, short email asking like they agreed to buy and asked how to view the item. I provided the condo name (w/o unit number to be cautious) and asked him to call when reached. The person did not turn up at the meeting time. Guess that was how my phone got into hands of stranger. Next working day(5/11/2018) and during hour, I received a local number with SGP international code (while I am in Singapore) . The number was +65 62567574. It was strange. I answered. It was a voice machine claiming I have a parcel from Singpost and ask me to press ‘2’ ( this is the only option available). A person with strong Chinese accent answered, and asked for my name and my NRIC number. Getting already suspicious, I tried to verify him by asking what is singpost address. He could only tell me ‘Eunos Number 8’ in Chinese. I did not relent. After a few times that he could not provide me a satisfactory reply. He hanged up. I then call back the number. It was a singtel announcement indicating the number was actually not in used.
Matched a girl with the name of 小莉in tinder offering part time sexual services. Agreed to meet in AMK Avenue 10 Blk 532 area. She said that someone will call me in regards of the payment. Around 15mins later, someone with the name of Ling Kun called with unknown caller ID and asked me to proceed payment using Alipay Purchase Card to the email dzv99e@163.com. Made payment twice, first payment of 102.60 is for the service and the second payment of 615.45 was for the deposit of security of the girl. After I purchased the Alipay card, I saw the police banner written there was sex scam reported in the neighborhood and immediately I bailed out. The gangster asked to made third time payment of 1000sgd but I didn’t and he said he will send someone out within the next 2 mins and beat me up. Immediately fled from the scene.

Scammer said she is still in Korea will arrive in Singapore with her Friend. Both are interested in my rooms. Her sms was +6399xxxxxxxx They wanted to view my room. I replied few sms and found that the call was made from Philippines. They could have linked up with someone already here and will physically be here to view my room. Scammers now won’t resort to email because this has become fruitless as more of their deeds were exposed...in fact, they will link up with real persons , who were in Singapore already, to view your room. Be careful. Note that you must always ask for their work permit to check with MOM before coming to view your house. This will be difficult for scammer, and you see...they will stop pestering you in case u reported them. Never transfer or give any money, no matter what never give away your money.
Started with FB request, moved to FB messenger &amp; WhatsApp. Soon he's FB profile got deactivate (this made me feel fishy) Claiming he’s from London, 35 years old, director of Operation in Chevron company. After 1-2 weeks, because he just won some contract, and he wanted and insisted to send a ‘surprise gift’ to me. The ‘gift’ parcel was sent by “Overseas couriers”, where there was an "official" website that ended up to be fraudulent, where you can also "search" and locate ur parcel with the airway bill he provided. Then he will tell you need to pay some custom and tax fees upon receiving, he also showed me the freight charges were GBP650 which didn't make sense to me. I started to discover everything was so fishy and googled his phone number online and found there was another person who was scammed and shared their story, mine was exactly the same story line.. Beware single ladies! He keeps saying I miss u, I love u out of no reason! The photos he uses are not extremely cute guys, but not too bad looking and down to the earth kind which makes u lose ur guards. Scammer's details: Raymond Chong Chevron energy, then told me he is from Nexen Energy (what a paradox) Or Henry Chong/Exxon Mobil oil and gas in London +44 7895 286965

1 to 2 years ago, while i was surfing online, there was a pop up window stating a malware attack. When i clicked in, there is an option to contact the technician support so i just went ahead. They mentioned they need to access through my computer to install the software and i allowed them. It costs $200 for a 2 years service ( no auto renewal was mentioned), so i just paid the technician and receipt was provided since they are Singapore based. Even though i felt bit cheated after purchasing their services knowing that my computer might not even have a problem ( after googling), thinking that after the 2 years i won't be bothered by them, i just let it be. Just today, they called and asked whether i would like to continue with their service and i told them no. They told me that since it was an auto renewal of the services, if i were to cancel, i have to pay the remaining $300USD. I questioned them why is my card detail still with them and told them to cancel the service if not i will make a police report. So instead of cancelling, now they threaten me, told me they will not cancel the service and let it charge another 300 to 800 USD. They hanged up my phone and told me to wait for the charges. Immediately, i called to cancel my card and make a police report. From this incident, i have learnt not to provide any information and to google before accepting this offer. Anyone can be a victim of scam but don't let it the incident fear you, be calm and do the necessary things.
Knew him on Paktor and we move to watsapp to chat. He is a South Korea living in Seoul and is divorce for 8 months because his wife cheated on him. He wants to find a long term partner who will love, care and will not backstabbed him again. He called me everyday to chat with me, said he love me very much. Sent me text message everyday to ask how's my day and have I taken my lunch. When I told him, I am sick, he immediately call me to ask what happen. When I have doubts about the relationship and send him text message at 3am, he called me within the next 30mins to pacify my doubts. He complained that I have seldom call him and I should call him more often. During one of the call, he asked me to help him buy itunes cards that cost $200. Asked him to pay me back and he said he will transfer to my bank account the next day. However, it didn't happen. Instead, he told me that there are some issues with his business and needed me to transfer $4000 to him. It was then that I realise it is a scam. I called the police to file for report.
Scammer made contact through email from internet listing of room for rent. And quick to commit confirmation though she was in China. Pretend to ask what payment requirements and same tactics of asking me open PayPal account. Through PayPal, send her the link to transfer $900 rent, and shortly after, she send some details that had transferred $2000 to my PayPal account. But nothing was credited and stupid tactics of having wait 2-5days to receive the funds. Then claimed that his/her movers need payment and offered me $100 more for the trouble, thus asking to make transfer thru WU to a subject in Shanghai, ZHANG CONG, Xian Feng Street, LP Tower. Certainly had emailed PayPal to verify and decided to play along with him/her. When told inform other party that they are listed on scam list, nothing heard thereafter. Making this report to alert and warn all others of this scammer at large. He/she will email an image of a SG NRIC bearing the name of Chan Wai Yee, S7276188Z, which very likely may be misplaced/stolen/lost and picked up by them and exploit for illegal activities.
Received a call from the number +62562413, there was a recorded voice message in singlish format saying that I have a parcel with singpost and that it is uncollected. Next it asked me to press option 1 to talk to a customer service officer. When I reached the customer service officer, the first thing he said was "yes?". This made me quite suspicious. I told him the message said I have a uncollected parcel and he proceed to ask me for my NRIC. I did not loose any money.

After winning a contract presentation, he promised to give me a GIFT and will send all items before he flew off the next day for Bolivia. He said he sent alot of luxury items, rolex watch, pink laptop, waist trainer, gold bracelet and I just need to pay the overweight taxes.

I was on an online forum (locanto if im not wrong) and there was this person named jason offering jobs that can make u earn 2500 at home. Being interested, i enquired and he said all i needed to do was to accept money for him because he is going overseas for a few months. And just transferred him the money by following his insructions. He asked me for my bank account and i stupidly gave him. But he proceeded on with asking for my pin. Felt something was off and denied him but he threatened me. Being scared i closed my forum account. But recently, when i finally am free to look through my account transactions, i found many many small transfers varying from 20 to 600 dollars. I have no clue when it started but called the bank to cancel all these transactions to return to their owners. Bank then requested me to close this account and open a new one. Never ever ever going to give me bank account online anymore.
Scammer posed as fake buyer for 2 high value designer bag. Said items are needed urgently and will ask courier to collect. Fund transfer is a suspicious Bank of America screenshot. As expected funds are not in and I refused to release my items. Scammer started calling me names and threatening to shot me. Luckily I have only given him my bank account number. I have called to bank to alert them of scam and look out for possible suspicious account activity.
I was just inquiring regarding IELTS exams then a person offer something, saying that he is working in an immigration office, that i can get a certificate without taking exams and so on. I realized he uses a lot different numbers which made me felt uncomfortable. And always threatening me saying that if i don’t pay the amount he/she will disclose my identity.
I am not an easy fall in love person. So, I easily doubt on someone who I just knew less than 1 year and less seen in face to face. I am Chinese, so those anonymous whose profile picture is Chinese or Mexican will send me message. I will reply, because I still believe there is good man in this world. Few of them have similar profile, they definitely from America(I have no idea why America), some sort of professional occupation such as engineer or pilot etc. After a week of chatting, he will start say he want to buy you something because he so much care of you... then ask for address. I rejected, and he said I don't love him. Excuse me, I barely know you how am I going to fall in love with an anonymous who just pop out from nowhere. I been trying to find out how much tricks they using in love scam, but few times reject, he knew he cant get anything from me, sooner or later no more news from him or his drama. Hey people out there, dont easily trust someone you barely know him well. Protect yourself always.
I had purchased tickets for BTS concert (Singapore) from Viagogo and selected a section that was close to the stage for triple the ticket price. But instead of receiving what I had originally purchased, I was given one that was in a completely different section, so that large sum was completely not worth it and down the drain. Unfortunately, as scammers do Viagogo refused to take any form of responsibility nor provide any compensation for all that was lost.

The online platform was not a real trading platform, but you wouldn't know because they designed it professionally. Their facebook page has many likes, all a set up because I am very sure that the likes are all set up by their own employees. The brokers use fake names. They use VOIP numbers and you will not be able to trace where they are calling from even though they use fake call locations like London and Switzerland. They try to gain your trust and make profit. They will use complicated money making methods and may eventually swallow your money if you give them authority to manage your account. After you deposit more money, they will ask you for more money. They will ask you whether you want to test their system for withdrawal to gain your trust. The realisation dawned when I wanted to book all my profits and withdraw all my profits and principle amount and I am met with excuses upon excuses. They will not give you back your money. But managed to claim back much through a credit card chargeback. If I had teletransfer the money through a bank instead, all would have been lost. After I stopped trading with them, they have been harrassing me weekly with VOIP calls from their related scam brokerage and finance firms. Lesson learnt. Beware: 1) do not teletransfer to strangers 2) do not trade with brokers not authorised by the government 3) do not trade with people you haven't met and does not have physical presence in your country
Long story short..ive known this guy name richard who claimed himself as a pilot in ik.one day he said he was in dubai doing some interview and said that he passed. Then he said because of my kindness for praying him to be success he asked for my address because he wants to send a parcel to show his gratitude.. at 1st i doubt it..but he kept convincing me to take the parcel that contains only watch bags jewelry shoes etc. Im not happy to know that he was giving me lots of things. But then the parcel was told to be stucked in indonesia so they asked me to pay for the tax charges around 2600. I texted him n told him that i dont have money to pay 4 the tax but he kept on forcing me to pay half of it then ill be fine.n yes i did transfer 1000 sum of money.then the next 3 days the company of eazylinkcourier.com told me they have scanned the parcel n saw a sum of money in it.. they said i have to pay 6500usd for the anti terrorism certificate or else police will ce to my home country for money laundering. I was panic and i texted my brother to ask his police friend about that. Than i know i was actually involve in scam. Please beware of the numbers ive given n also the company link..both are related ...
I am an investigative journalist and did a research on the Sugar Mummy scam circus in Singapore. They all operate the same way. No one is what they say they are. I contacted 6 of the agents on Locanto and other sites via WhatsApp and they were all scammers. They might change names but one thing is for 100% sure. You will be scammed! Basically they have a pre-paid phone card with a generic profile photo. They all asure you they are not scammers. After giving them you name, age and civil status they will ask for 300-500 SGDs for a fee. They only accept bank transfer. Then when you have payed this they ask for 1400-1900 SGD for further fees and insurance. They promise you a BMW and a monthly salary of at least 10500 SGD and so on. My conclusion is "DON´T PAY ANYTHING" They are all scammers/fraudsters/liers. Don´t fall for any sweet talk or promises, you will be fooled and no sugar mummy is at the end of the rainbow. No matter who they say they are or that they have lots of clients that recommend them, nothing they say is true. The old saying goes: -How can you tell a scammer is lying? Their lips move... My investigation is complete and I am willing to hand it over to the SPF for further handling. BE AWARE! All suger mummy agents ARE SCAMMERS!
